Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch‚Äôs behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran.

Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: ‚Äúre-opened‚Äù) the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: 
And the news is breaking while we‚Äôre on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn‚Äôt need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. 
Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner‚Äôs well-known penchant for lying, it‚Äôs hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms ‚Äî and, as Wallace indicated on this morning‚Äôs show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We‚Äôll see if Weiner‚Äôs cooperation extends beyond that.

Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act‚ÄîObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don‚Äôt work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. 
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: 
1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 
2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 
3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn‚Äôt Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Case‚Ä¶Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times‚Ä¶Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince 
Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs email server last week. 
‚ÄúBecause of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,‚Äù Prince claimed. 
‚ÄúThey found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to go public with this if you don‚Äôt reopen the investigation and you don‚Äôt do the right thing with timely indictments,‚Äô‚Äù Prince explained. 
‚ÄúI believe ‚Äì I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York ‚Äì the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they‚Äôve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That‚Äôs the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,‚Äù Prince said. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860,‚Äù Prince declared. 
Marlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. 
‚ÄúNYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,‚Äù Prince elaborated. ‚ÄúWeiner and Huma Abedin, his wife ‚Äì the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years ‚Äì have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have ‚Äì they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù Prince contended. 
‚ÄúThere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they‚Äôve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,‚Äù he stated. 
‚ÄúSo the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs ‚Äì that‚Äôs the level just below commissioner ‚Äì he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue,‚Äù Prince said. 
He noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, ‚Äúbut they can‚Äôt convene a grand jury. They can‚Äôt file charges.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúNow, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, he‚Äôs a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing.‚Äù 
Marlow agreed that Bharara‚Äôs ‚Äústerling reputation‚Äù as a determined prosecutor was ‚Äúbad news for the Clintons.‚Äù 
Prince agreed, but said, ‚ÄúIf people are willing to bend or break the law and don‚Äôt really care about the Constitution or due process ‚Äì if you‚Äôre willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone ‚Äì who knows what level of pressure‚Äù could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? 
Listen to interview here: 
‚ÄúThe point being, fortunately, it‚Äôs not just the FBI; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well,‚Äù Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has ‚Äúexposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Department‚Äù against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to ‚Äúkeep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,‚Äù he warned. 
As for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that ‚Äúde Blasio wants to stay away from this.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,‚Äù he said.

Democrat Dr. Brenda Snipes was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2003 and is no stranger to controversy. On October 20, the Sun Sentinal reported that former Oakland Park Commissioner Anne Sallee noticed something troubling about her vote-by-mail ballot. It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results. Her office also was criticized for sending out inaccurate voter ID cards, and for printing ballots for November that include the word ‚Äúno‚Äù in the ‚Äúyes‚Äù line on the county‚Äôs transportation sales surtax question.

Limbaugh said that the revelations in the Wikileaks material were ‚Äústarting to hurt‚Äù the Clintons and that the renewed interest in an FBI investigation into her private email server would be a fruitless distraction. 
In any case‚Ä¶ 
IT‚ÄôS TIME TO DRAIN THE SWAMP! 
FBI Director James Comey said Sunday that the agency has reviewed all of the Hillary Clinton emails recently discovered in an unrelated case and that his conclusion in July not to prosecute Clinton after the FBI‚Äôs original investigation into her use of private email server still stands. 
Comey informed Congress on Oct. 28 that the agency would, in the unrelated case, review additional emails related to Clinton‚Äôs time running the State Department from 2009 to 2013. 
‚ÄúSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,‚Äù Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. ‚ÄúDuring that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state.

The President wants to ensure the students that the university remains committed to their ‚Äúmost important responsibility‚Äù at their school which is apparently, ‚Äúto remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty ‚Äì and to diversity, equity and inclusion.‚Äù: 
To All Members of the University Community: 
As I‚Äôm sure many of you did, I watched the election coverage late into the night, and had the opportunity to visit with students and staff at a results-watching event sponsored by the Ginsberg Center at the Michigan Union. It will take quite some time to completely absorb the results from yesterday‚Äôs election, understand the full implications, and discern the long-term impact on our university and our nation . More immediately, in the aftermath of a close and highly contentious election we continue to embrace our most important responsibility as a university community. Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty ‚Äì and to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are at our best when we come together to engage respectfully across our ideological differences; to support ALL who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding, as we always have, as the students, faculty and staff of the University of Michigan. There are reports of members of our community offering support to one another. Students are planning a vigil tonight on the Diag at 6 p.m. Our Center for Research on Teaching and Learning also has numerous resources available for faculty seeking help in cultivating classroom environments that are responsive to national issues. I also want to make everyone aware of some of the plans and events we have had in place for today and beyond. ¬∑ Our Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy is holding a Post-Election Analysis from 4 to 5:30 p.m. today in the Weill Hall‚Äôs Annenberg Auditorium. Speakers include former U.S. Congressman John Dingell, former Ambassador Ron Weiser, and faculty members Mara Ostfeld, Betsey Stevenson and Marina Whitman. ¬∑ Our History Department has organized a community discussion led by faculty and students to include historical perspectives at 6 p.m. tonight in 1014 Tisch Hall. ¬∑ The Office of Student Life will provide resources and referrals for support on campus to students, faculty and staff at a location in the Michigan Union‚Äôs Willis Ward Lounge. It will be open today from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. ¬∑ Our Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs is offering an open space of support to help members of our community connect during open hours today. MESA‚Äôs office is in the Michigan Union, Room 2202. ¬∑ Tomorrow, our Ginsberg Center and Counseling and Psychological Services office is facilitating a Post-election Dialogue: Impact, Perspective-taking, and Moving Forward. This event is part of the Student Life Professional Development Conference at 1 ‚Äì 2 p.m. in the Michigan League‚Äôs Henderson Room. I know that other schools, colleges and offices across our campus are planning events as well. I thank everyone who is helping us come together and ask anyone scheduling a post election event post it on the University of Michigan Events Calendar. I hope all of us will continue to proudly embrace the opportunities before us as the students, faculty and staff of a great public research university governed by the people. Elections are often times of great change, but the values we stand for at U-M have been shaped over the course of nearly 200 years.

MATH SHOWS Trump Would Have Beaten Obama In Romney-Obama Election ¬ª 100percentfedUp.com;"Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trump‚Ä¶it turns out Trump was right‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ‚Äònever Trumpers‚Äô from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him‚Ä¶ 
It‚Äôs easy to glance at Tuesday‚Äôs popular vote ‚Äî which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 ‚Äì and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama‚Äôs 2012 totals in several Midwestern states ‚Äî Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin ‚Äî Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What‚Äôs more, she far surpassed Obama‚Äôs 2012 vote total in Florida, the country‚Äôs biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country‚Äôs most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation‚Äôs most critical battleground states. Let‚Äôs look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren‚Äôt yet final because not all precincts have reported.

He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he‚Äôd like to, ‚Äúpunch him in the face.‚Äù Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,‚ÄùComedian‚Äù? 
Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù the tycoon‚Äôs win in the presidential election had made him. 
The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film ‚ÄúThe Comedian‚Äù in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump‚Äôs victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
‚ÄúHow am I doing? I‚Äôm very depressed,‚Äù the famously laconic ‚ÄúRaging Bull‚Äù actor told reporters. 
‚ÄúWe have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.‚Äù 
Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday‚Äôs election, he replied: ‚ÄúYes, absolutely. Things aren‚Äôt being done right.‚Äù 
Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday. 
In Manhattan, they held signs reading ‚ÄúYour Wall Can‚Äôt Stand in Our Way‚Äù ‚Äî a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico. 
De Niro hasn‚Äôt minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as ‚Äúa punk,‚Äù ‚Äúa pig‚Äù and ‚Äúan idiot.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to punch him in the face,‚Äù he said before the election. 
Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro‚Äôs grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape. 
‚ÄúIf, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,‚Äù said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano.

The Forgotten Man painting is amazing in its symbolism. 
Here‚Äôs how McNaughton describes the painting: 
Against the background of a darkening sky, all of the past Presidents of the United States gather before the White House, as if to commemorate some great event. In the left hand corner of the painting sits a man. That man, with his head bowed appears distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future. Some of the past Presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern Presidents as if to say, ‚ÄúWhat have you done?‚Äù Many of these modern Presidents, seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves, appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments. In front of the man, paper trash is blowing in the wind. Crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, and, like a whisper‚Äîthe U.S. Constitution beneath the foot of Barack Obama. 
THE FORGOTTEN MAN‚Ä¶ 
McNaughton never sells his original paintings BUT he made an exception this time. He sold this painting to Sean Hannity so Hannity could give it to Donald Trump. Awesome, huh? 
November 9th McNaughton announced via facebook that he sold the original to Sean Hannity: 
‚ÄúSean Hannity just purchased my painting ‚ÄúThe Forgotten Man‚Äù to give to Donald Trump to hang in the White House‚Äù

She put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. She is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, I supported her anyhow, because she‚Äôs a Democrat and has a vagina. Someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if I just signed a petition. They said that Trump really didn‚Äôt win, because Hillary won the popular vote. Is that true? 
Okay, let‚Äôs address this ‚ÄúHillary might win the popular vote, isn‚Äôt that Electoral College situation just awful‚Äù thing head on. 
No, it‚Äôs not awful. It‚Äôs great, and it protects the importance of your vote. It‚Äôs also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. 
First of all, she‚Äôs probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. 
States don‚Äôt count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn‚Äôt influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren‚Äôt counted. 
Who votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore ‚Äúwon‚Äù the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from California‚Äôs uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gore‚Äôs 500,000 popular vote ‚Äúvictory.‚Äù (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? You‚Äôre kidding.) 
Getting back to the ‚Äúwin the popular vote/lose the Electoral College‚Äù scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. 
But the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. 
Shortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the country‚Äôs entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. ‚Äì American Thinker Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!";english;2016-11-13T06:02:47.949+02:00;100percentfedup.com;US;25689.0;SORRY LIBERALS‚Ä¶You Can Stop With The Petitions‚Ä¶Hillary Did NOT Win The Popular Vote;0.0;http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2546106-thumb.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Political activist and Hillary supporter Amal Clooney traveled to Texas to warn Americans about our elected President Donald J. Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didn‚Äôt get the memo‚Ä¶Trump‚Äôs tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasn‚Äôt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, ‚ÄúThere will never be a President Trump‚Äù. 
Perhaps Amal should‚Äôve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns‚Ä¶ 
Amal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump‚Äôs proposals would be ‚Äòviolations of international law.‚Äô 
Speaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America‚Äôs reputation under the real estate mogul‚Äôs plans. 
She noted that Trump‚Äôs comments during his campaign, ‚Äòthat there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed ‚Äî all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.‚Äô 
The 38-year-old wife said America‚Äôs reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. 
‚ÄòI think there‚Äôs some concern from abroad as to, ‚ÄúAre these things actually going to happen?‚Äù, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,‚Äô according to the Hollywood Reporter. 
Perhaps its time to put our nation‚Äôs security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us‚Ä¶ 
Both Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. 
Earlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. 
Watch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: 
‚ÄòWhen you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, ‚ÄòThey only want jihad. They don‚Äôt believe in our way of life. They don‚Äôt respect our system,‚Äù Clooney said. Via: Daily Mail  ";english;2016-11-20T03:53:12.132+02:00;100percentfedup.com;US;25689.0;LOL!

They had to know they had it coming‚Ä¶ 
Donald Trump scolded media big shots during an off-the-record Trump Tower sitdown on Monday, sources told The Post. 
‚ÄúIt was like a f‚Äìing firing squad,‚Äù one source said of the encounter. 
‚ÄúTrump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ‚ÄòI hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed,‚Äô ‚Äù the source said. 
‚ÄúThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,‚Äù the source added. 
A second source confirmed the fireworks. 
‚ÄúThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks,‚Äù the other source said. 
‚ÄúTrump kept saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.‚Äô He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars,‚Äù the source said. 
‚ÄúTrump didn‚Äôt say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate ‚Äì which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.‚Äù 
The stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a Trump Administration. 
‚Äú[CBS Good Morning co-host Gayle] King did not stand up, but asked some question, ‚ÄòHow do you propose we the media work with you?‚Äô Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked ‚ÄòHow are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.‚Äù 
Here‚Äôs a sampling of Trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail. Trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before, he won the election in a landslide, in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down: 
Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway told reporters the gathering went well. 
‚ÄúExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks,‚Äù she said during a gaggle in the lobby of Trump Tower. ‚ÄúPretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.‚Äù

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
21WIRE reported on Friday about the FBI‚Äôs surprising announcement that it would be reopening the Clinton email case due to new evidence of ‚Äòclassified information‚Äô found on sex cheat Anthony Weiner‚Äôs (newly estranged husband of Clinton chief aid Huma Abedin) computer which was subject to a seperate investigation. Will this really yield anything significant in the 10 days running-up to the Nov 8th election, or is this just clever Democrat party smoke and mirrors? It seems that Washington‚Äôs political tricksters have already sprung into action‚Ä¶ 
After Comey‚Äôs shock announcement, a ‚Äúleaked‚Äù memo appeared out of nowhere, supplied to Fox News , in which Comey and the FBI seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control. 
ELITE CIRCLES: FBI head James Comey and friend Hillary Clinton. 
Certainly, a desperate Democratic Party, and an even more desperate Obama White House (over the last 3 weeks, Obama and his wife Michelle have been out campaigning more that Hillary Clinton herself), could be pressuring or nudging the FBI on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against Donald Trump. Aside from the obvious potential of another Clinton scandal, yesterday‚Äôs FBI move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios: Protect the President, who is already deeply tied to the Clinton email cover-up Democratic Party Machine has created a distraction to cover-up latest Wikileaks dump. FBI are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring Hillary Clintons. Create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious Trump scandal next week. 
NOTE: Despite calls from the Clinton camp for FBI to disclose what they have (which they cannot by law anyway, you‚Äôd think Hillary would have already known that), it is highly unlikely that the FBI will release any real specifics before the election ‚Äì if they have anything at all. It‚Äôs just too early to tell. 
SEE ALSO: FBI James Comey was board member of HSBC ‚Äì Clinton Foundation & Drug Cartel ‚Äòbank of choice‚Äô 
The FBI director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the Justice Department seek an indictment against Clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation ‚Äì allowing Clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election ‚Äì despite the fact that Comey stated to a Congressional investigative committee that Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless,‚Äù and that Clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the US Secretary of State. 
Zero Hedge adds: 
‚ÄúNow, it is the democrats turn to rage at Comey and the FBI, although Comey likely did not have much choice: had he kept the information secret, it certainly would have leaked as we predicted; as such his best recourse was to come clean, although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure. Needless to say, all Comey would need to do to regain the Demcorats‚Äô trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over.‚Äù 
Here is ‚Äúleaked‚Äù (aka ‚Äòjust covering my ass) memo from FBI director James Comey: 
Watch this space. Here is a highlight reel of Hillary Clinton lying on at least 5 occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server:

In a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton. 
‚ÄòNEW PROBE‚Äô‚Äì The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look. (Photo illustraion 21WIRE) 
FBI October Surprise? 
According to reports , in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey , stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clinton‚Äôs personal email server. 
CNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comey‚Äôs letter discussing the new investigation: 
‚ÄúIn previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton‚Äôs personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,‚Äù Comey wrote. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,‚Äù he added. 
Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,‚Äù Comey concluded.‚Äù 
Huma‚Äôs Estranged ‚ÄòSexting‚Äô Husband 
According to a new report released via The New York Times : 
‚ÄúThe presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton ‚Äôs private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.‚Äù ‚Äú In a letter to Congress , the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide.‚Äù Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her ‚Äòhome brew‚Äô email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a U-turn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled. 
This unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docu-dump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton ‚Äòs private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a $30 million dollar business arrangement under ‚ÄúBill Clinton, Inc.,‚Äù with another $66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years. 
The following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation‚Ä¶ 
The new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new ‚ÄòPay-to-Play‚Äô allegations , as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit ‚Äòlarge-scale‚Äô voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies. Out of Creamer‚Äôs 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times. White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47 ‚Äúprivate meetings with Obama or his senior staff,‚Äù also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics ‚Äì thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability. ‚ÄòCAUGHT ON FILM‚Äô ‚Äì Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy. (Image Source: CNN ) Creamer, a convicted felon , (in 2005, Creamer plead guilty $2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations) was promptly ‚Äúshoved out of the Hillary Clinton campaign‚Äôs inner circle,‚Äù following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at Trump rallies. ‚ÄòPAY TO PLAY?‚Äô‚Äì Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe closely allied with the Clinton‚Äôs negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the FBI. (Image Source new republic ) It remains unclear what exactly reopened the new Clinton probe, but perhaps the FBI had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime Clinton associate , Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe , ‚Äúhelped steer $675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email system, according to a report.‚Äù The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week: 
‚ÄúThe political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave $467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal . 
The report states Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. 
The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate‚Äôs husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau.‚Äù 
In a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations, ‚Äú‚Ä¶According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton‚Äôs email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling ‚Äúpressured‚Äù by another FBI official at Kennedy‚Äôs request.‚Äù 
The newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but there‚Äôs no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates ‚Äì the agency needed to save face. 
It remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election.

Not only was it revealed that the Creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Donald Trump rallies on camera ‚Äì he also met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year, including 47 private meetings with President Obama or other senior officials. 
‚ÄòDNC SCANDAL‚Äô‚Äì Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners and Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. (Image Source: National Vanguard ) 
Creamer‚Äôs visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky . 
White House visitor records have shown that Schakowsky took 47 ‚Äúprivate meetings with Obama or his senior staff,‚Äù over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics , potentially giving the Clinton campaign and the DNC plausible deniability. 
The Mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim DNC chair Donna Brazile , is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two 2016 town hall debates. Brazile stepped down from her role at CNN earlier in October. Here‚Äôs a passage from the Daily Caller describing the scenario: 
‚ÄúDonna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show.‚Äù 
The article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim DNC chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined: 
‚ÄúIn the March 12 exchange, Brazile mentions [Roland] Martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll send a few more. Though some questions Roland submitted,‚Äù Brazile wrote to Palmieri in the March 12 email thread, which is entitled ‚ÄúFrom time to time I get the questions in advance.‚Äù 
Martin, is a commentator for TV One and the host of News One Now , as well as a CNN contributor. 
In another matter, the Wall Street Journal revealed the following , while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the FBI and DOJ, while the FBI appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments: 
‚ÄúThe latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe [of the Terry McAuliffe campaign contribution scandal], the bureau‚Äôs second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.‚Äù 
Some critics have called for McCabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received $675,000 from a well-known Clinton confidant, Terry McAuliffe . This was further underlined after the House Oversight Commitee wanted more information about the Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe and its ties to the Clintons. 
The alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates ‚Äòobjected‚Äô to FBI Director James Comey reopening the Clinton email server case this past week ‚Äì something that added to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting before the first FBI ruling in the Clinton case. 
According to a report filed by Zero Hedge , a close friend of Podesta, Peter Kadzik , the Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), will be in charge of a probe into Huma Abedin , Clintion‚Äôs closest aide. 
Interestingly, as a mountain of controversy envelops the Clinton campaign, the FBI is now conducting an early inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort , over his alleged foreign business connections. 
Back in August, the following business connection was revealed by NBC news : 
‚ÄúIn 2008, according to court records, senior Trump aide Paul Manafort‚Äôs firm was involved with a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmytro Firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous New York hotel, the Drake. The total value of the project was $850 million. Firtash‚Äôs company planned to invest over $100 million, the records say. 
That same year, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, according to a classified State Department cable. Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine.‚Äù 
Although the US State Department has determined that Firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in Russia ‚Äì so far, there‚Äôs nothing directly linking Manafort to any underground element at this time. 
Watch this space ‚Äì as the Russia/Trump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Clinton campaign meltdown.

WikiLeaks: Trump Rally Agitator and Clinton Campaign Manager Are ‚ÄòClose‚Äô 
Top Clinton aides discussed Bob Creamer and his ‚Äògrassroots/netroots‚Äô operation 
by Jim Stinson LifeZette 
Robert Creamer, the operative behind sending provocateurs to Donald Trump rallies, was close to Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager, according to new emails released by WikiLeaks. 
Creamer, who allegedly spearheaded the dirty tricks for the Democrats, wasn‚Äôt just consulting for the Democratic National Committee, according to videos made by Project Veritas. He was sending people to provoke Trump at events. 
Creamer has thus become a red-hot issue in the campaign. And now it‚Äôs apparent he is close to Mook. That surprising detail came out Sunday morning when WikiLeaks posted hundreds more emails from John Podesta‚Äôs Gmail account. Podesta is Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman whose account was hacked in March.

Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire 
The longer this soap opera drags on, it‚Äôs becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not ‚Äòhack‚Äô into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta‚Äôs emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. 
The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that ‚ÄòPutin is hacking the US elections.‚Äô In response, the President is weighing his options ‚Äì tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed ‚Äòmalicious cyber-activity‚Äô tools. 
Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,‚ÄùWe‚Äôre sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.‚Äù 
It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US? 
What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America‚Äôs left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington‚Äôs new anti-Russia movement. 
On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, ‚ÄúThe Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton‚Äôs private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans.‚Äù 
Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this ‚ÄòRussian hack‚Äô talking point was purely political, but then again, who‚Äôs really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media. 
You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party‚Äôs hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump‚Äôs GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump‚Äôs political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, ‚Äòcomparing one dictator to another.‚Äô 
Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance . ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party‚Äôs nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?‚Äù said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. 
Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia ‚Äì not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona ‚Äì a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media‚Äôs coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled, ‚Äú Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system ,‚Äù we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: 
‚ÄúHackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.‚Äù 
But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: 
‚ÄúThe bureau described the threat as ‚Äúcredible‚Äù and significant, ‚Äúan eight on a scale of one to 10,‚Äù Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state‚Äôs voter registration system for nearly a week.‚Äù 
And then, down to almost nothing‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúIt turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County.‚Äù 
At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, ‚ÄúCyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack.‚Äù 
Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French: ‚Äòbottom of the bag‚Äô) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories ‚Äì in the middle a national election cycle? It‚Äôs a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. 
Behind Clinton‚Äôs wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House‚Ä¶ 
On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager John Podesta ‚Äì giving them to Wikileaks. 
Soon, there was a queue of ‚Äònational security‚Äô politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, ‚ÄúRussia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin‚Äôs calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, ¬≠cyber and economic response.‚Äù 
According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only ‚Äòevidence‚Äô that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged ‚ÄòRussian government hacks‚Äô‚Äì provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike‚Äôs word for it. 
IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security. 
The Post‚Äôs Nakashima then added: 
‚ÄúThe administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers.‚Äù 
An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are ‚Äúconsistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,‚Äù the joint statement said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia‚Äôs senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.‚Äù 
Moscow‚Äôs press secretary‚Äôs reply: ‚ÄúThis is some sort of nonsense,‚Äù said Dmitry Peskov. 
Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN‚Äôs Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù that Russia was behind the email hacks ‚Äì and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. 
Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that ‚ÄúRussia did it,‚Äù thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn‚Äôt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona ‚Äì are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a ‚Äò parallel universe .‚Äô 
Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how ‚Äú 17 US intelligence agencies ‚Äù aka the ‚ÄúIntelligence Community‚Äù‚Äì all agreed that Russia did it. 
The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
‚ÄúWe have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,‚Äù said Clinton. ‚ÄúI find that deeply disturbing.‚Äù 
What‚Äôs even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äô17 agencies‚Äô: 
Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta‚Äôs emails? Answer: nothing. 
The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. 
In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington‚Äôs flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and ‚Äújournalists‚Äù working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN ‚Äì none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party‚Äôs decree that ‚ÄúRussian is hacking the US election process.‚Äù If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow ‚Äî the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia‚Äôs senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.‚Äù According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are ‚Äòhacking‚Äô US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a ‚Äú disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. ‚Äù 
Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into ‚Äúpeople linked to the Trump team with Russia.‚Äù Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven‚Äôt come up with anything. 
To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack ‚Äì because her staff read it to her from the campaign‚Äôs daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government‚Äôs much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, that‚Äôs the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam‚Äôs nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq‚Äôs imaginary ‚ÄúWinnebagos of Death‚Äù aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. 
For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as ‚ÄòWashington Intelligence,‚Äô I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, ‚ÄúNo, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We‚Äôre not like that. No, this time it‚Äôs different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!‚Äù 
In 2014, Obama claimed that Kim‚Äôs notorious ‚ÄúBureau 121‚Äù hacked into Sony Pictures. 
This isn‚Äôt the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign ‚Äòhack‚Äô and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington‚Äôs conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called ‚Äò Bureau 121 .‚Äô Just like with today‚Äôs ‚ÄúRussian Hack‚Äù theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House‚Äôs ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the ‚ÄòRussian Hack‚Äô claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . 
Jumping the Shark 
After their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. 
Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to ‚Äúdestabilize and dominate the West.‚Äù Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of ‚Äòinterfering‚Äô with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks ? Shining a spotlight on Russia‚Äôs attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump‚Äôs refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5 
‚Äî Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016 
Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only ‚Äòevidence‚Äô seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as ‚Äòproof‚Äô that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign‚Äôs desperate claims. It was embarrassing. 
They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. 
Either way, the political strategy here is clear ‚Äì to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video ‚Äì their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. 
Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. 
To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. ‚ÄúFor the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,‚Äù said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. ‚ÄúI am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year‚Äôs historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week‚Äôs events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,‚Äù said Clinton. 
The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. 
Party Meltdown 
Wasserman Schultz‚Äôs replacement didn‚Äôt fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches ‚Äì showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives ‚Äì straight to Hillary Clinton. 
‚Äú A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper.‚Äù 
‚Äú A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.‚Äù (Source: Daily Caller ) 
Brazile‚Äôs audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party‚Äôs planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: 
. Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Brazile‚Äôs reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her ‚Äì and that‚Äôs saying a lot. 
In addition, it was also revealed how CNN‚Äôs head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of ‚Äòjournalists‚Äô the Clinton campaign would ‚Äúwork with‚Äù to gain favorable coverage. You‚Äôd think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN‚Äôs election coverage. 
Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in ""GOP hell"" and says she'll ""reach out soon"" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5

Worse Than Watergate 
Perhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury ‚Äì is the FBI‚Äôs investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: 
‚ÄúSome investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn‚Äôt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.‚Äù 
There‚Äôs more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe ‚Äì a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . 
So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top ‚Äì to the President himself. 
What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary‚Äôs unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton‚Äôs server ‚Äúthe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.‚Äù The President‚Äôs lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: 
‚ÄúObama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton‚Äôs private email server.‚Äù 
So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails ‚Äúoff grid‚Äù with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server ‚Äì maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. 
Sure, he‚Äôs not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club ‚Äì caught out lying to the American people. 
On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as ‚Äú born classified .‚Äù The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. 
COVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News ) 
It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action ‚Äì that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. 
On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case ‚Äì currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a ‚Äòsexting‚Äô scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik? Zero Hedge reports: 
‚ÄúOh yes. Recall our post from last week, ‚Äú Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary‚Äôs Benghazi Hearing ‚Äù in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik.‚Äù 
Oh, and if that wasn‚Äôt good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta‚Äôs lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as ‚Äòbest friends.‚Äô FOX News confirms: 
‚ÄúFantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,‚Äù Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta‚Äôs Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. 
To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. 
Russia ‚Äì The Party Scapegoat 
Former Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting: ‚ÄúIronically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.‚Äù Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. 
‚Äî Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016 
Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused ‚Äúthe KGB‚Äù working with Republicans to ‚Äúhijack the election‚Äù during his wild rant on MSNBC . 
‚ÄúI think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That‚Äôs what I think,‚Äù said Carville. 
Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. 
These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos√©s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence ‚Äì unlike the ‚ÄòRussians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks.‚Äô 
Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that ‚ÄòPutin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.‚Äô They‚Äôve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep ‚Äì a perfect double entendre . 
The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington‚Äôs State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown ‚Äì that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed ‚Äòrebels‚Äô Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki. 
With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? 
The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d‚Äôetat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it‚Äôs been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks ‚Äì and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America‚Äôs own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , ‚ÄúWe are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram,‚Äù He was forced to resign shortly after that. 
What‚Äôs clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although ‚Äò Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17 ,‚Äô and ‚Äò Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013 ‚Äò certainly comes to mind. 
That said, it‚Äôs hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of ‚ÄòHacking Into the US Electoral Process.‚Äô When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington‚Äôs claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election 
On Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: 
‚ÄúWe have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It‚Äôs not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security.‚Äù 
Self-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era. 
Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere ‚Äì if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. 
Still, we‚Äôre waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington ‚Äì before it‚Äôs too late.

Here is an article that looks at the real story behind one of the more interesting conspiracy theories about the 2016 election: 
Sometimes the real story is even more fascinating than any conspiracy theory. WeAreYourGods 
Wanna bet money that the Weiner laptop, on which the over 600,000 emails were stored in a folder titled ‚ÄúLife Insurance‚Äù, holds information linking the CF to human trafficking and typical elite pedophilia ‚Äúvacations‚Äù? Ever wonder why nobody ever really goes after the Clinton Foundation from a government office? Same old blackmail scheme involving underage sex slaves that was going on during the Boys Town scandal with Lawrence King and elite politicians and business people in the 80‚Äôs. Why would they stop? Brad Dueringer 
It seems the most morally depraved beings are the ones we let run things. But they have help crafting ‚Äúreality‚Äù with the tribe that owns the media Analyze_This_88 
Barrak Obama and Hillary Clinton are both political scam artists. It‚Äôs amazing that a US President would invent a Russian Hacking conspiracy theory in order to drive a geopolitical agenda. But then again, Bush did the same with Bin Laden and 9/11. 
Clinton on the other hand is pure corruption personified. She‚Äôs should never be allowed near public office.

Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire 
The cozy relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years, giving the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton an immensely influential partner on Wall Street. 
As the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened FBI probe into the Hillary Clinton ‚Äôs email server case ‚Äì the global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs quietly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate this past week. 
The financial ties that bind the Clintons and Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are nothing new, but never before have the connections been so exposed. Let‚Äôs take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄòMONEY CHANGERS‚Äô‚Äì Wall Street‚Äôs Goldman Sachs are inextricably linked to the Clinton‚Äôs and The Clinton Foundation. (Photo illustration 21WIRE) 
The Clintons & Goldman Sachs 
While campaigning for his first term in the White House, former president Bill Clinton received an enormous amount of support from Washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on Wall Street. 
At the top of the pile sat Goldman Sachs‚Ä¶ 
In 1992, the LA Times reported that presidential nominee Bill Clinton,‚Äù received the largest share of his financial support‚Äìat least $2.6 million‚Äìfrom lawyers and lobbyists,‚Äù and that Clinton also received additional support from ‚Äú‚Ä¶big securities firms such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York and Stephens Inc. in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. In fact, Goldman Sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm: $98,700.‚Äù 
For decades the Clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth Goldman Sachs and in the process, a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold, something that even the NY Times admits: 
‚ÄúOver 20-plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundation‚Äôs charitable programs.‚Äù 
By now, there should be little doubt that the Clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street banking cartel. Their relationship was built over three decades. 
The real watershed moment came here‚Ä¶ 
BLANK CHECK: Bill Clinton laughs with Wall Street elites after signing the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999. 
‚ÄòKey to the Kingdom‚Äô 
In one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely. 
The Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act , which banking luminaries cynically named the ‚Äú Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999‚Ä≥ officially titled the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act . The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors ‚Äì the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the ‚Äòshadow banking‚Äô realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked. 
Simply put: Clinton‚Äôs repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking ‚Äì which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite ‚Äì which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that, ‚ÄúMy husband did so well with the economy.‚Äù Really? 
In a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post , Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990‚Äôs: 
‚ÄúTo grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband‚Äôs years in office.‚Äù 
Prins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled ‚Äú It Takes a Pillage : Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.‚Äù 
Prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world. 
The media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the ‚ÄòCiti-Travelers Act‚Äô on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administration‚Äôs influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: 
‚ÄúThen, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act , but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroup‚Äôs co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut.‚Äù 
At the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal , as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther . In 1999 , after ‚Äú12 attempts in 25 years,‚Äù Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act , which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. 
The repeal of Glass-Steagall was pushed heavily by Citigroup‚Äôs co-CEO Sanford Weill and lobbyist Roger Levy and according to a report by The Nation : 
‚ÄúThey laid out more than $290 million for lobbying in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and donated more than $150 million in the 1997‚Äì98 election cycle‚Äîa figure sure to be topped in 1999‚Äì2000.‚Äù 
How much of those contributions made their way to the Clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the White House? 
In 2005, Bill Clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private Goldman events. 
In 2013, after stepping down from her position as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at Goldman Sachs events to the tune of $675,000 dollars, in which one attendee said ‚Äús he sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director,‚Äù according to a quote obtained by Politico . Indeed, Clinton gave a glowing speech to the Goldman gang and in the process, as Wikileaks released in early October , the Democratic nominee believes in ‚Äúboth a public and a private position‚Äù on Wall Street reform and that it is an ‚Äú oversimplification‚Äù to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis. 
That Clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics, but it‚Äôs only the tip of a much larger iceberg. 
In 2015, the Washington Post reported that ‚ÄúHillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid.‚Äù 
‚ÄòANOINTED‚Äô: Chelsea Clinton with Goldman Sachs-backed hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky. 
The Clinton family is chock-full of banking connections, as Chelsea Clinton ‚Äòjoined‚Äô the Avenue Capital Group, which according to reports is a ‚Äú‚Ä¶$12 billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many Democratic Party campaigns.‚Äù Chelsea is married to Marc Mezvinsky , a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs. Chelsea‚Äôs tenure at Avenue Capital Group was from 2006-2008 just prior to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs run for president in 2008. Since then Chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the Clinton Foundation. 
Marc Mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity , after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of $25 million ‚Äì after blowing the money on secondhand junk Greek bank stocks and toxic government debt. 
The apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree‚Ä¶ 
As it turns out, Marc is the son of troubled former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky ‚Äì another close friend of Team Clinton. 
Politico reports on one of Ed Mezvinsky‚Äôs financial controversies in 1999: 
‚ÄúIn the waning days of Clinton‚Äôs presidency, federal prosecutors and the FBI were bearing down on former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa), who had fallen for a series of Ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly $10 million money from other investors to cover his losses. ‚Äú 
Continuing, Politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from Ed Mezvinsky‚Äôs wife to then President Bill Clinton: 
‚Äú‚Ä¶records released last week by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock and obtained by POLITICO show Mezvinsky and his then-wife ‚Äî ex-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.) ‚Äî pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case.‚Äù 
In 2016, the Daily Mail reported the following: ‚ÄúChelsea Clinton‚Äôs husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the Greek economy, and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds. Marc Mezvinsky, 38, and his partners, former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, raised $25million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation. That fund however has lost 90 percent of its value, investors with direct knowledge of the situation told The New York Times , and will now be closed.‚Äù

The NY Times further outlined the long-held Clinton/Goldman connection just two years before the 2007-2008 financial crisis: ‚ÄúThe Clintons‚Äô relationships with Wall Street deepened in the 2000s, when Mr. Clinton set up his foundation in Harlem and Mrs. Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York. That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York ‚Äî and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton. During her years in Congress, employees of Goldman donated in excess of $234,000 to Mrs. Clinton, more than those of any other company except Citigroup, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly $2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were on-site.‚Äù ‚ÄòHOW TO MONETIZE INFLUENCE‚Äô‚Äì Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event with Hillary Clinton. (Image Source: sputniknews ) The Wall Street Racket To understand who powers the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs billion dollar RICO influence-peddling slush fund, you need to understand how money is laundered between Wall Street and Washington DC. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the 2008 crash, then in April of 2016, Goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for $5 Billion dollars. CNBC reported the following: 
‚ÄúGoldman Sachs will pay $5 billion to settle federal and state probes into the bank‚Äôs sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis, the Justice Department announced Monday. 
Authorities said Goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and 2008 crisis. The settlement includes a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and $875 million to resolve various other claims. 
This resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,‚Äù acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery said in a statement .‚Äù 
In 2013, a Bloomberg article questioned how Goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the 2007-2008 economic crisis: 
‚ÄúWhether Goldman could have gone the way of Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch remains the subject of much debate. Goldman maintains that it did not need, or want, the $10 billion bailout that Hank Paulson [ former Goldman alum] pushed on it and other firms in October 2008. But the fact remains that when the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanley‚Äîbut not Lehman Brothers‚Äîto become bank holding companies on Sept. 21, 2008, Goldman was able, three days later, to raise $10 billion in equity, $5 billion from the public and another $5 billion from investor Warren Buffett. That would probably not have happened without the Fed‚Äôs expedited decision and support. (A week later, Morgan Stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a $9 billion equity investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.)‚Äù 
All told the Clinton friendly investment giant Goldman Sachs (after making record profits) became the fifth mega-bank ordered to pay billions to the Department of Justice after the financial crash of 2007-2008. In addition, the firm was ordered to pay $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014 ‚Äì not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the Great Recession. 
In a New York Review article Goldman Sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in 2007-2008: 
‚ÄúData gathered mostly from the Corporate Research Project , a public interest website, show that on thirteen occasions between 2009 and 2016, Goldman was penalized by US courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between 2006 and 2009.‚Äù 
‚ÄòCASHING OUT‚Äô‚Äì Bill Clinton with his top economic strategist Robert Rubin. (Image Source: St. Louis Post-Dispatch ) 
Wall Street Selects ‚ÄòTeam Clinton‚Äô 
The Clinton connection to Goldman Sachs emerged in the early 1990‚Äôs as Robert Rubin , a former senior partner with Goldman (with a 26-year tenure with the firm), joined former President Clinton‚Äôs economic policy team, later becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Around that time, the Clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the ‚ÄòRubinomics‚Äô banner (aka Clintonomics), the plan raised taxes on most Americans, specifically the middle class , in what was said to be the largest increase in American history at the time. 
According to Congressional record ( Vol.146 part 2 ), ‚ÄúIn 1995, the economy grew at a sickly 1.5% ‚Äì Clinton‚Äôs vetoes of spending cuts [insured] continued deficits well into the 21st Century.‚Äù 
In a Multinational Monitor report entitled ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äôs Best Investment: Ten Deregulatory Steps to Financial Meltdown,‚Äù by Robert Weissman and James Donahue , a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the 1990‚Äôs under the Clinton administration was revealed: 
‚ÄúDuring the Clinton Administration, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had run Goldman Sachs, enthusiastically promoted the legislation. In a 1995 testimony before the House Banking Committee, for example, Rubin argued that ‚Äúthe banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago, let alone in 1933. ‚Ä¶ U.S. banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically. Even domestically, the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by Glass-Steagall has eroded significantly.‚Äù 
With a pedigree that included Goldman Sachs, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The Brookings Institution and the Bilderberg Group , Robert Rubin emerged in 1999 as the vice chairman at Citigroup (1999-2009) after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of Glass-Steagall while serving as Secretary of Treasury. Rubin made a fortune with Citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the 2007-2008 crash. Here‚Äôs a passage from Bloomberg regarding Rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse: 
‚ÄúWhen it collapsed, due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100 million while others lost everything. ‚ÄúYou have to view people in a fair light,‚Äù says Phil Angelides, co-chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clinton-era prosperity. ‚ÄúBut on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster.‚Äù

Under the Microscope 
Over the summer 21WIRE observed some curious connections between the Clinton Foundation and FBI director James Comey , as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the Clinton family. Here‚Äôs the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation: 
‚ÄúMany will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank ‚Äì a bank implicated in international money laundering , including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels. Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key choke-point during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case: 
‚ÄúIf Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF +% were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations.‚Äù 
In 2015, the Guardian discussed the financial relationship between HSBC and the Clinton Foundation receiving a startling $81 million in donations from clients of the large bank: 
‚ÄúThe charitable foundation run by Hillary Clinton and her family has received as much as $81m from wealthy international donors who were clients of HSBC‚Äôs controversial Swiss bank. 
Leaked files from HSBC‚Äôs Swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with accounts in Geneva.‚Äù 
A new update on the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was announced over the last 24 hours, in addition the recently reopened Clinton email probe from last week. It remains to be seen how in-depth this new investigation will be. 
To call it collusion would be an understatement. When looking back at the financial affairs of the Clintons, Goldman Sachs and others on Wall Street ‚Äì it‚Äôs clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate.

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
This should be the biggest revelation yet from WikiLeaks already epic email trove. Will the US media cover this story? 
Last night, in an RT Exclusive interview conducted by award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange described what he believes is ‚Äúthe most significant email in the whole collection.‚Äù 
WikiLeaks reveals an early 2014 email where the outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was urging John Podesta , then advisor to President Barack Obama, to ‚Äúbring pressure‚Äù on Gulf states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, ‚Äúwhich are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.‚Äù 
This constitutes proof that the Clinton Foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in ‚Äòcharitable‚Äô donations from the same Gulf states which both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations. 
In addition, the Clinton‚Äôs Foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies: 
(Infographic: Conservative Post ) 
This latest news validates what 21WIRE has been saying since the ‚ÄòISIS crisis‚Äô began in June 2014. 
According to FOX News , FBI sources have said that ‚Äòindictments are likely‚Äô for the Clinton Foundation investigation. One only wonders how this latest Assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation ‚Äì as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy ‚Äì two things which Clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning. 
Assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against Clinton and her family foundation: 
‚ÄúAll serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ‚Äúrogue‚Äù princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.‚Äù 
During their 25-minute interview filmed at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Assange and Pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between Clinton as Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation and Gulf monarchies who financed them. The following is an excerpt from the interview transcript: 
John Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia. 
Julian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton ‚Äì and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it ‚Äì the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value. 
JP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation? 
JA: Yes.

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Yesterday, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange confirmed what 21WIRE already knew ‚Äì that Hillary Clinton and the Obama White House‚Äôs claim of the US election process being ‚Äúhacked by the Russian government‚Äù was a desperate work of fiction. Not content with that fish tale, Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low (if that was even possible) with another, wilder made-up conspiracy story about the Russians. 
The following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term ‚Äú jumping the shark ‚Äú: It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX 
‚Äî Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 
Apparently, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign staff fed her a planted online news story (by the Clinton campaign?) which ran on a questionable pro-Democratic Party online news outlet. On Monday, the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged ‚Äújournalists‚Äù named Franklin Foer , complete with a clickbait blog-like headline, ‚ÄúWas a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?‚Äù 
Whatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night, just evaporated. 
John Roberts from Forbes explains, ‚ÄúThe bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a ‚Äúfollow up‚Äù piece is in the works.‚Äù 
Roberts rightly points out that the only follow-up story for this lemon should start with the word ‚ÄúRETRACTION.‚Äù 
CYBER FEUD: Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession. 
During his exclusive interview with award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, when asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs shrill antics, Julian Assange said, ‚Äú ‚ÄúI actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick.‚Äù 
The saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party ‚Äì is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty. Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power, the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess. 
Still, Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower ‚Äì with a decade-old misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZ-style tabloid sting. That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season. 
Assange was right. Clinton, the Democratic Party and their surrogate, are eating themselves. Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it.

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Over the past months, Hillary Clinton, the Obama White House and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that ‚Äú Russia is Hacking the US Election ‚Äù‚Äì blaming Moscow for the WikiLeaks emails, the DNC Leaks and for allegedly ‚Äòhacking‚Äô US voting systems. Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. 
It goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Party‚Äôs crazed witch hunt has been to US-Russian relations, where Clinton has led the anti-Russian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. 
Today‚Äôs stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. 
With such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward‚Ä¶ 
In a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other‚Äôs views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. 
Putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing Russian-American relations out of their current crisis. 
The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some ‚Äúburning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,‚Äù RIA Novosti reported. 
On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that ‚Äúbuilding a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other‚Äôs positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.‚Äù 
According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia‚Äôs relations with the US ‚Äúwas not our choice,‚Äù however. 
For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia‚Äôs interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. 
‚ÄúWe are concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy,‚Äù Putin said at an economic forum in Moscow‚Ä¶

Mexico‚Äôs billionaire tycoon Carlos Slim saw a large chuck of his wealth evaporate ‚Äì literally overnight, after news of a Donald Trump election victory hit the currency and stock markets on Wednesday morning. 
According to Bloomberg financial analysts, Slim, Mexico‚Äôs wealthiest person and rated fifth on the global rich list, took a stinging $5.1 billion haircut after the Mexican Peso went into a 12% free fall after Trump‚Äôs stunning upset over Democratic Hillary Clinton. 
Slim‚Äôs loss amounted to a staggering 9.2 percent of his total fortune. 
In the week before, polls showed Hillary Clinton as the odds on favorite, netting the billionaires a staggering $57 billion in total wealth increase across world markets. However, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, oligarchs lost a total of $41 billion during Wednesday‚Äôs epic slide ‚Äì with Slim being the biggest loser.

One of the great myths being spun by the establishment media was that Donald Trump had no support from women, latinos and blacks in the US. As it turned out, this was a lie propagated in a failed attempt to margnalize Republican voters and give a false impression of a liberal Democratic mandate in America. In the end Trump gathered 29% of Latinos, 9% of African Americans and 49% of college educated white women. For months, mainstream media pundits and polls insisted that all of these demographics were exclusively for Hillary Clinton. How could they have got it so wrong? 
Psychologist and intenet radio personality Kiki Green explains how blacks were conned into voting for Hillary Clinton by the partnership between the Democratic Party, Hollywood and the Clinton campaign ‚Äì by cynically using celebrities like Beyonce, Jay Z and Katie Perry‚Ä¶

Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire 
Anti-Trump street protests linked to the Soros‚Äô funded organization MoveOn.org have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the 2016 presidential election result. 
Mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC have given the protests around-the-clock media coverage, drowning out all other news stories, including a successful transition meeting between the President Elect and President Barack Obama. 
‚ÄòOUTSIDER VS. INSIDER‚Äô‚Äì Manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of Trump presidency. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE‚Äôs Shawn Helton) 
The Free Thought Project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated anti-Trump protests organized in part by by the George Soros NGO MoveOn: 
‚ÄúWashington, D.C. ‚Äì Billionaire globalist financier George Soros‚Äô MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump ‚Äî exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation ‚Äî and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. 
Wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle , and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. 
In light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it‚Äôs an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous.‚Äù 
Soros‚Äô affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: 
‚ÄúAmericans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results 
Hundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. 
Tonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesday‚Äôs presidential election. 
The gatherings ‚Äì organized by MoveOn.org and allies ‚Äì will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trump‚Äôs bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible. 
Within two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon.‚Äù 
Soros Agit-Prop Empire 
Last year during the ongoing European migrant crisis, startling claims were levied by Hungarian PM Victor Orban (left photo), concerning the role played by Soros. 
PM Orban contended that the founder and chair of Open Society Foundations (Open Society Institute), was entrenched in a ‚Äú circle of activists,‚Äù that ‚Äúinadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network.‚Äù 
The stunning declaration by Orban recalled the misguided machinations of ‚ÄòThe Occupy Movement‚Äô ( aka OWS) in 2011, as well as the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, along with other Black Lives Matter protests this past year ‚Äì all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants (along with paid provocateurs) into violent action and social unrest. 
Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It‚Äôs worth mentioning, that MoveOn also supported the Obama campaign in 2008 and according to the website, Sanders was the only other candidate to reach the ‚Äúthreshold for an endorsement.‚Äù 
As we said back in March, professional political agitator flash mobs, had been mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign ‚Äì as ‚Äòactivists‚Äô attempted to take away Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòstrength in numbers‚Äô at his rallies. This was confirmed at events in both Ohio, and at a Trump primary campaign event the University of Illinois Chicago earlier this year, where hundreds of BLM activists and Sanders supporters, triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage , shortly after Trump started speaking, then again at Reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort Trump away. 
In a Politico article in early 2016 entitled ‚Äú Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter ,‚Äù we gained deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: 
‚ÄúMajor donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,‚Äù said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement.‚Äù 
It worth noting how Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to ‚Äúboost‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs campaign . Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump‚Äôs rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond. 
Look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country ‚Äì as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances. 
‚ÄòSOCIAL ENGINEERING‚Äô‚Äì Political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media, NGO‚Äôs and social media. (Image Source: abc news ) 
During the last month, it was revealed how investigative non-profit Project Veritas found evidence that the DNC paid participants to incite violence at Trump rallies during the course of the 2016 election. 
If those reports are accurate ‚Äì reports which have gone unchallenged so far ‚Äì this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also US criminal law.

USA Color Revolutions 
Both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption, and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare. These political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions. Ultimately, a radical globalist and cultural marxist ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù agenda is at play ‚Äì eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial ‚Äòcolor‚Äô upheavals, and where possible ‚Äì weakening a country‚Äôs national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public‚Äôs political perspective. 
This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization ‚Äòcolor revolution‚Äô campaigns overseas , and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US. 
Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. 
Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org , as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week‚Äôs protests. 
It still remains to be seen if Trump‚Äôs stated dynamic political vision for America can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world, in addition to helping economic woes at home, or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism. This remains to be seen. 
Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs total silence over their own party‚Äôs role in fomenting this week‚Äôs unrest ‚Äì one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable ‚Äì to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency. 
But one thing is for sure ‚Äì there‚Äôs no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the 45th president and the public should question why. 
Legal Action Against Soros Groups 
In a recent report featured at RT news we learn that George Soros and BLM activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge: ‚ÄúThe father of the Dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a Black Lives Matter protest is suing the organization‚Äôs activists and George Soros for $550 million . In a separate suit a Baton Rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a BLM protest. 
The father of Patrick Zamarripa filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and other groups for allegedly ‚Äúinciting a war on police‚Äù that led to the death of his son. 
The lawsuit filed in US District Court in Dallas on Monday seeks $550 million in damages. 
‚ÄúWhile Defendant Black Lives Matter claims to combat anti-black racism,‚Äù the lawsuit said, according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram, ‚Äúthe movement has in fact incited and committed further violence, severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities, Jews, and Caucasians. Defendant Black Lives Matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang.‚Äù 
The misguided machinations behind the anti-Trump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the president-elect. Will these protest groups be a reboot of the OWS movement, occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into 2017 and beyond?

George Soros begins his color revolution in America, as MoveOn ‚Äúactivists‚Äù march against Trump 
By Alex Christoforou The Duran 
Anti-Trump protesters march through the streets of New York shouting ‚ÄòNot my president‚Äô. 
MoveOn.org is a George Soros NGO‚Ä¶and George Soros NGOs have nothing to do with charity or justice, and everything to do with political leverage, and in extreme cases government insurrection. 
We have seen Soros begin destructive movements to remove those he deems unsuitable to govern in a variety of countries, most recently in Ukraine, with the Soros sponsored Maidan coup. 
Now it looks like Soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming Trump presidency. 
We do know, thanks to Wikileaks, that George Soros was a huge supporter of Hillary Clinton, as Hillary Clinton was always looking out of George Soros‚Äô best interests. 
We are certain Trump‚Äôs victory is a bitter pill for globalist Soros to swallow. Between Putin and Trump, Soros may finally be starting to feel his power on the world stage falter.

Organized efforts are underway by Democratic Party affiliated NGO‚Äôs to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this week‚Äôs US Presidential Election. 
On the eve of the US Election before voters went to the polls, 21WIRE political affairs analyst Patrick Henningsen accurately predicted this week‚Äôs unrest when he said : 
‚ÄúIf Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN‚Äôs 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage.‚Äù 
On Friday, Henningsen talked to RT International about the post-elections protests that were coordinated in part by Democratic Party ‚Äòcommunity organizing‚Äô online platform MoveOn.org . Watch: 
. Not surprisingly, MoveOn.org have also launched a national ‚Äòactivist‚Äô campaign to ‚Äú Abolish the Electoral College ‚Äù after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came up short with 232 (including New Hampshire) to Donald Trump‚Äôs 306 (including Arizona and Michigan). Final totals are not yet in, but thus far 2016 would be the fifth time in U.S. history that a presidential candidate has won the White House while losing the total popular vote.

Schools, universities and political institutions across the country are now offering various services following Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs insurgent victory in the US presidential election. 
According to NBC News , Democratic staffers were so distraught over this week‚Äôs election that ‚Äútherapy dogs‚Äù had to be brought in to help workers on Capitol Hill cope with their vulnerabilities and hurt feelings.

Other US campuses were organizing various theraputic activities like poetry readings, where ‚Äúhealthy snacks will be served.‚Äù 
The dogs were organized by NGOs the Human Animal Bond Research Initiative, Pet Partners, the Pet Leadership Council and the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council. 
Their press release says that Democratic Party staffers needed, ‚Äúthe help of a non-judgmental, furry, four-legged best friend that enjoys bipartisan support.‚Äù

J.R. Smith 21st Century Wire 
The election campaign might be over, but the mainstream media‚Äôs campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. 
Between all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-Clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks‚Äô Podesta email dump ‚Äì nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left. 
It‚Äôs now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears ‚Äì and all the while pushing fictional ‚Äòhate crime‚Äô hoaxes. 
CBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to ‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. 
When told about alleged reports of a ‚ÄòTrump supporter‚Äô who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl , ‚ÄúI am so saddened to hear that.‚Äù He then added, ‚ÄúAnd I say, ‚ÄòStop it.‚Äô If it helps, I will say this ‚Äì and I will say right to the cameras: ‚ÄòStop it.'‚Äù 
One big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged ‚Äúabuses‚Äù by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though it‚Äôs obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses ‚Äì Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf ‚Äì without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was ‚Äòdrive-by‚Äô media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes. 
Now, it‚Äôs perfectly understandable that Trump‚Äôs victory over the establishment‚Äôs heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that ‚Äòthey‚Äô lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of America‚Äôs politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow ‚Äúcausing many minorities fearful about the future‚Äù. In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. 
In fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged ‚Äòhate crime‚Äô incident ‚Äì one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. 
Buzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace : 
A woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. 
The woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported. 
Lafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. 
‚ÄúDuring the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,‚Äù the statement reportedly read. 
NOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described ‚Äújournalists‚Äù who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of America‚Äôs corrupt liberal mainstream media. 
That‚Äôs right ‚Äì this was just another hoax: 
Violent Democratic-Affiliated Street Gangs 
What Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesday‚Äôs election, nearly all of the so-called ‚Äòviolent hate crimes‚Äô have been carried out against Trump supporters ‚Äì by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters.

When the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information, Wilcox was greeted by a gang of African-Americans, presumably Democratic Party supporters, who began pointing and shouting, ‚ÄúYou voted for Donald Trump!‚Äù before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street. Wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight. He was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. 
From reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, it‚Äôs political intimidation done on the street ‚Äì which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers ‚Äì enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video: . Agitator and Chief: Where is Obama? 
These incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency. 
Amidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Party‚Äôs losing candidate Hillary Clinton ‚Äì to help calm street thugs and violent ‚Äòprogressives‚Äô? It‚Äôs almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this week‚Äôs media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage. 
What used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style ‚Äòsafe‚Äô segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of ‚Äòjob for life‚Äô government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say it‚Äôs irredeemable . 
One of the corporate mainstream‚Äôs worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled ‚ÄúReliable Sources.‚Äù Stelter is meant to be CNN‚Äôs media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as ‚Äúsenior media analyst.‚Äù After leading CNN‚Äôs own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trump‚Äôs Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among Democrats) Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his network‚Äôs horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But it‚Äôs too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. 
Now CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNN‚Äôs which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk ‚Äì all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in today‚Äôs toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses ‚Äì they are all way past shameless at this stage. 
None of them can be trusted anymore ‚Äì only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years.

CBS News is under fire for holding a videotaped clip from a Friday interview with President-elect Donald Trump urging supporters not to attack minorities until a ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù broadcast on Sunday night. 
‚ÄúI am very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear it,‚Äù Trump told interviewer Lesley Stahl when told of some attacks on minorities that have reportedly occurred since his election victory Tuesday. 
‚ÄúI am so sorry to hear it, and I say stop it,‚Äù Trump said before looking directly into the camera. ‚ÄúAnd I say right to the camera, stop it.‚Äù 
‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù did release quotes from the Friday interview in advance, but only a statement by Trump on the Affordable Care Act. 
‚ÄúWe chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare,‚Äù a spokesperson for CBS told CNN Monday.

‚ÄúThe person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the White House. It may well be Donald J. Trump, but further due diligence is required to ensure that American democracy is not threatened.‚Äù 
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Although the election was called on Nov 8th, the Democratic Party‚Äôs ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming President is still ongoing. 
For those of us with long enough memories, the Democratic Party, their media operatives and the Clinton Campaign were claiming that Trump and the GOP would be engaged in this very same behavior after Hillary Clinton won the Presidency (as expected). 
Notice how the shoe is now on the other foot. 
It‚Äôs interesting reading past stories by ‚Äònews‚Äô sources linked to the Clinton Campaign and John Podesta as Politico has, who ran a feature on Aug 16th entitled, ‚ÄúWhy the GOP Will Never Accept President Hillary Clinton‚Äù which lays out the case of Hillary‚Äôs lock on the White House and how the evil Republicans will not accept her eventual election victory. 
‚ÄúWill Donald Trump respect the peaceful transition of power?‚Äù howled CNN‚Äôs Wolf Blitzer in the run-up to the election. The question now is: will the Democrats respect the result, and simply ‚ÄúMove On,‚Äù as they say? 
Of course, we now know that ‚Äòjournalists‚Äô like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign . 
As it turns out, the only thing illegitimate about the 2016 Election‚Ä¶ was the mainstream corporate media.

The Guardian 
A growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers. 
The loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved. 
The document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in verifying the vote,‚Äù said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting. ‚ÄúWe need to have post-election ballot audits.‚Äù Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement. 
A second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan‚Äôs center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons. 
In a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. 
‚ÄúUnfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts,‚Äù he said. 
The developments follow Clinton‚Äôs surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election‚Ä¶

While Richard Spencer‚Äôs half-joke of hailing Donald Trump with R oman salute rose a lot of dust, some remarks in his NPI speech point into rather sinister direction. A posthuman one. 
transcript with references and additional a/v material: 
Undoubtedly, there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when Hillary Clinton lost Presidential elections to Donald Trump. If for nothing else, then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears ‚Äúbecause: racism, homophobia, xenophobia and whateverphobia‚Äù; it was a joy, and a relief, because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism , dubbed ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù, to be a paper tiger. 
However, party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance. As SJW s are, hopefully, moving out from the spotlight of post-historical stage, the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image. If we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn, this image will be just as ugly ‚Äì and just as unreal ‚Äì as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct ‚Äú shitlib ‚Äù. 
In the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the ‚Äúalternative right‚Äù movement, Richard Spencer, in the future we are to deal with the leadership of ‚Äúchildren of the sun‚Äù. 
This is an interesting, and to my mind quite worrisome, statement of intent ‚Äì a manifestation of will, as Spencer would doubtless rectify me ‚Äì pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal ‚Äì and quite unidirectional ‚Äì circular movement of the pagan deity, revered by all self-respecting √ºbermenschen ‚Äì from Nietzsche to postmodern occultists. 
However, there‚Äôs a deeper astro-theological metaphor at work here. The ‚Äúpure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy‚Äù (Nietzsche) in it‚Äôs virtual, postmodern, installment is not to be strictly represented by Swastika ‚Äì as Spencer apparently assumes, but by other, only seemingly ancient, symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and PC gaming and turned into ideological brand by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin (or his minions): an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement. 
The symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement, not of sun, but of presumably primordial origin of everything: Chaos. 
In the lines to follow, we‚Äôll provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation: the channeling of chaos principle ‚Äì and adjacent chaos logic ‚Äì through loosely knit alt right movement, taking as a starting point some statements from Spencer‚Äôs speech held at NPI Conference in Washington D.C. on November 21 st . 
Triumph of the will or hipster Babylon working 
In introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right, embodied in the election of Donald Trump, Spencer makes one interesting remark: 
‚ÄúBut even though we always took Trump seriously, there was still a moment of unreality ‚Äì or perhaps too painfully intense reality ‚Äì when the state of Pennsylvania was called for Donald Trump, the moment when we knew Kek had smiled upon us, that meme magic was real. And though these terms are used half-jokingly, they represent something truly important‚Äìthe victory of will . We willed Donald Trump into office, made this dream into reality. ‚Äù 
It is all delivered in a manner of an in-joke, not to be taken too seriously. Moreover, to the uninitiated into mysteries of this Internet movement it is probably unclear who is ‚ÄúKek‚Äù and what exactly is ‚Äúmeme magic‚Äù. 
We‚Äôll start our explanation with lesser weirdness. 
‚ÄúMeme‚Äù is an expression denoting ‚Äúinexistent existent‚Äù, coined apparently by Richard Dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology: memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which, by circulation in public, acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to ‚Äúinfect‚Äù the consciousness with their messages, like viruses. Meme is inexistent because there‚Äôs no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based self-subsistence and ability to procreate like viruses. Images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based: what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial. Yet they, quite paradoxically, exist because analogy apparently works . However no one seems to pose the question, why it works. 
Well, it works because it is magical. 
Chaos Magick 
Here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern ‚Äì in fact posthumanist ‚Äì vein, resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can ‚Äì and should ‚Äì be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution. If artificial construct is in line with ‚Äúprinciple of evolution‚Äù it is real or, to be more precise, it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle; it is imagined into existence . 
Therefore ‚Äúmeme magick‚Äù works only insofar it relies upon artificial, preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial, preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with ‚Äúmemes‚Äù as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs. 
The goal of practitioner of such magic ‚Äì a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic ‚Äì is to change the world according to his will. This is, more or less, what is known from the Seventies of the last century as chaos magick , a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in sub-human and sub-natural ‚Äúdomain‚Äù of the world, in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it. The peculiarity of chaos magick is, on the one hand, that it is entirely syncretic, i.e. that it uses everything that it‚Äôs practitioner can imbibe with intended, subjective, meaning, and that it relies on virtual, i.e. artificial world of mass culture, now embodied above all in Internet. 
The idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible . 
There are many interesting implications to this. 
The first is that everything is interrelated, i.e. that everything is connected with everything else. So any which way you take, you‚Äôll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough. The second is that there‚Äôs no hierarchy of higher and lower ‚Äì there‚Äôs only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements, dissolving in turn into nothingness, if concentrated upon. As there‚Äôs nothing higher, there‚Äôs nothing to be revered and everything can ‚Äì and indeed: should ‚Äì be an object of ironical laughter. And, most importantly, this is the world of dreams, ruled by what is usually called ‚Äúdream logic‚Äù but in actual fact: chaos logic or un-logic . 
In this sense, Richard Spencer quite accurately proclaimed Trump‚Äôs victory an accomplishment of meme- or chaos magick. 
Trump is willed into office by Internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality ‚Äì virtual reality, one may add, yet reality nonetheless. The fact that Trump was elected for a plethora of motives ‚Äì from the appeal of his politics, to public takedown of Hillary Clinton by Wikileaks ‚Äì is immaterial, because in the world of chaos every subjective ‚Äúreality tunnel‚Äù, or interpretation of the world, is as real as any other. 
In this sense we can observe new ‚ÄúGod Emperor of USA‚Äù as a magical creation of Internet, by the Internet and for the Internet ‚Äì today still the Internet of interconnected computer nodes, but soon probably the Internet of things. If one is to push Spencer‚Äôs remark to it‚Äôs logical extreme, we can assert that illustrious Donald is the world‚Äôs first president of posthuman race; an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra anti-progressive group. 
So that was lesser weirdness. Let us proceed now to high weirdness. 
We owe the reader an answer to a question: who the hell is Kek? 
Well, the reason why Spencer mentions him is again a magickal ‚Äúhalf-joke‚Äù: Kek is interpreted to be an ancient Egyptian deity by a number of Internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar ‚Äì Pepe the frog. While I habitually suspend judgment on all things Egyptian, because ancient Egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts, I consider this interpretation, upon closer inspection, to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic. 
Namely, Pepe, the cartoon character, conceived in 2005. by cartoonist Matt Furie, emerged as a meme from the depths of Internet forums, more precisely: 4chan sub-forum /pol/, devoted to political discussions with no holds barred, which was, in view of some observers, a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados; a place of absolute freedom, therefore: absolute chaos. 
The expression ‚Äúkek‚Äù was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the in-joke among the players of World of Warcraft , replacing the standard Internet abbreviation ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù (‚Äúlaughing out loud‚Äù). Someone eventually noticed that Kek is in fact the name of frog-headed Egyptian deity, signifying Chaos and darkness, and Pepe was rebranded as Kek the deity ‚Äì ironic one, no doubt, half joking one, as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it, but deity nonetheless. 
It is important to point out that in view of the most ‚Äúesoteric Kekists‚Äù, that is: (half grinning) faithful of Kek/Pepe, the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental, yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities ‚Äì causally unrelated meaningful relations among events. So it came to pass that Kek sounds very similar to ‚Äòcuck‚Äô(originally: cuckservative), a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not ‚Äúred pilled‚Äù (another meme taken from pop culture, shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists) by alt right or, should we assume: Kek himself; furthermore, Hillary Clinton addressed Pepe as nothing less than public enemy, identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character. Then it happened that after this act Hillary fainted in front of the cameras, and that was immediately interpreted as an action of Kek. 
A good run-down of Kek/Pepe/Trump identification 
However, it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ sub-forum: 
‚ÄûOne last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture: dubs. 
Every post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8-digit numerical stamp. This number represents that post‚Äôs entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard. 
With the amount of traffic these sites get, the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll. When a poster gets repeated digits, its called ‚Äúdubs‚Äù, ‚Äútrips‚Äù, ‚Äúquads‚Äù, and so on. 
Since a poster can‚Äôt know their post number until after they‚Äôve submitted the post, its common for people to ‚Äúbet‚Äù the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits (‚Ä¶) When that endeavor proves a successful, a ‚ÄúGET‚Äù has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated. 
Out of this practice, a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/: discussion threads associated with Trump displayed noticeably frequent GETs. It wasn‚Äôt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture: Pepe the Frog (now /pol/‚Äôs unofficial mascot) Donald Trump (/pol/‚Äôs overwhelming candidate of choice) Repeating digit post numbers (‚ÄúGETS‚Äù) ‚ÄúKEK‚Äù (used as an expression of delight, particular in response to Trump‚Äôs ‚Äútrolling‚Äù of the establishment, as well as in reaction to unlikely GETs in general) 
‚Ä¶and a god was born.‚Äú ( source ) 
Synchronicities related to emergence of Kek the God and his merging with Trump in the bowels of Internet forums early on in the presidential campaign, are so numerous and, frankly, mind boggling that we cannot list them here, for the sake of brevity. For our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados, including core leadership, Kek is the God and Trump is his prophet, all declared with smug grin and ironical stance, yet with all the necessary power of conviction. 
Namely, chaos magick relies on laughter, or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially un-principled. Fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its ‚Äúpractitioner‚Äù to impose his own will and change the world ‚Äì as Spencer would put it: make his dreams a reality. 
I would go further and add: make all reality a dream ; because, chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual, i.e. posthuman , world. The idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism ‚Äì in its essence, however, it is a complete opposite: a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles ‚Äì above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of Being ‚Äì into nothingness of primordial Chaos. 
Posthuman traditionalism 
I already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Alexander Dugin, who is probably the most consequent subverter of Tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age, but now we can see how his affiliates in USA and Europe are doing the same thing ‚Äì with less philosophical subtlety, but fueled by much greater raw power. Namely, alt right, if we are to judge by what it‚Äôs leadership advocates, is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition ‚Äì something Richard Spencer likes to call ‚Äúpolitical theology‚Äù ‚Äì founded on New Age filtered Aryan myths , racial interpretation of Nietzsche and generally crossbred with ‚Äúdo your own thing‚Äù mentality, all done in the virtual ether of information technology. After all, if we are to agree with Spencer ‚Äì half jokingly of course ‚Äì that God Emperor was inaugurated by the act of Kek the God, then the victory of alt right ‚Äútraditionalists‚Äù is in fact the victory of technological magic; the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand Ray Kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics . 
In the end, therefore, we are talking about another victory of posthumanism, branded, spontaneously or otherwise, as traditionalism. The obsession of alt right adherents with ‚Äúidentity‚Äù in general and ‚Äúwhite identity‚Äù in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of Tradition they supposedly defend: they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted . Observing the plethora of various, rather eccentric individuals in it‚Äôs vanguard, from macho gay postmodern Spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic ‚Äì and to a large extent made up ‚Äì pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator, save maybe for quite unchallenged neo-darwinist stance, especially to be found among ‚Äúgame‚Äù bloggers as Chateau Heartiste . If someone thinks that he can reattach himself to pre-modern spiritual history of humankind ‚Äì actually the only one there is ‚Äì while at the same time musing about ‚Äúalpha and beta males‚Äù, ‚Äúsexual market‚Äù, ‚Äúsignaling and counter-signaling‚Äù, professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental GMO of memes, genes and biological analogies, he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends. 
The allure of alt right lies in it‚Äôs dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the West, induced by process of globalization. Yet this is an eristic or, to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine: discordian dialectic; the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of Chaos. It is all done with the crooked half grin, a pinch of salt to every smug remark ‚Äì with irony of the man who knows he‚Äôs a liar and a cheat. But smug humor goes just a short way. In the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend, far more effectively than dead serious PC brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for. 
We‚Äôll end with the word of warning to Christian adherents of alt right. The words have a definite meanings and power. There‚Äôs only one Chaos and there‚Äôs only one bringer of light from Chaos ‚Äì as some Kek worshipers already defined the poor Frog‚Äôs main job . And it‚Äôs not the One to be defined as ‚ÄúGod from God, Light from Light‚Äù, but ‚ÄúGod from Gutter, Light from Darkness‚Äù. A real Darkness shining in virtual brightness. Hope you guess His name. 
So, without a pinch of irony, I declare: be careful who your ‚Äúhail‚Äù.

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
If there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the EU‚Äôs super bureaucratic class, those doubts can finally be put to rest this week. It seems that Europe‚Äôs technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of ‚ÄòEuro Red Scare‚Äô brainwashing. 
The new EU Resolution compares Russian media organizations to terrorist groups like ISIS (see full report below). The report also claims that Russian ‚Äú social media and internet trolls ‚Äù are somehow ‚Äú challenging democratic values .‚Äù The new anti-Russia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the ‚Äòanti-Russia‚Äô programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this ‚Äògrave threat to democracy.‚Äô A touch oxymoronic, isn‚Äôt it? 
EU Parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot. Claiming that Europe is currently ‚Äòat war with Russia‚Äô is one thing, but the hysterical notion that ‚ÄúRussian propaganda‚Äù is somehow damaging the minds of Europeans is a whole new level of crazy. 
No wonder millions of Britons voted to leave the EU this past summer. 
The cold reality is that most of the ‚Äòdangerous views and information‚Äô aired on RT are by presenters, contributors and pundits ‚Äî westerners , not Russians. The reason RT‚Äôs audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see RT‚Äôs reports as more accurate, and truthful than media monoliths like the BBC, CNN and other establishment outlets. By spending most of their time, effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally, the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences. The age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over. RT understood this in 2005 when their news network took shape. 11 years later, western media moguls are playing catch-up, albeit in vain.Sunset for Goebbels. Hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a Deep State star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge ‚Äì obsessed with controlling real information, rather than disseminating it ‚Äì that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good. They are simply unable to do authentic journalism, or speak truth to power . Incredibly, instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime, ideologues in Brussels want to attack RT. 
The faceless force behind this latest xenophobic EU resolution are those in Washington, Paris and London who are still hell-bent on keeping anti-Russian economic sanctions in place ‚Äì much to the disservice of many European businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with Russia. When Donald Trump is sworn in this January, the US-UK-EU anti-Russian axis could disintegrate within a year ‚Äì so this latest move by Brussels could be a last-ditch effort to do some damage as Europe‚Äôs NeoMcCarthyites plot their escape out the back door. From their disastrous coup d‚Äôetat in the Ukraine , to NATO‚Äôs hubris in the Baltic and beyond, and the EU‚Äôs ‚Äòmigrant crisis‚Äô debacle, and the tens of millions of Euros being laundered by EU member states through a pseudo NGO called the ‚Äò White Helmets‚Äô in Syria ‚Äì these last 3 years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history ‚Äì an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy, underpinned by a backward and confused ideology. 
We tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject, but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. See the following video and written report by RT International‚Ä¶ 
. RT MEPs in Strasbourg have voted on a non-legislative resolution which calls for the EU to ‚Äúrespond to information warfare by Russia.‚Äù RT and Sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous ‚Äútools‚Äù of ‚Äúhostile propaganda.‚Äù 
The EU Parliament‚Äôs resolution demonstrates ‚Äú political degradation ‚Äù in regard to the ‚Äú idea of democracy ‚Äù in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, commenting on the vote. 
Putin pointed out that while ‚Äú everyone tries to lecture ‚Äù Russia on democracy, European lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions, ‚Äú which is not the best way ‚Äù to deal with any issues. 
‚Äú The best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support one‚Äôs point of view should be presented ,‚Äù Putin said. 
Adding that he hopes the Western move to ‚Äú counter Russian propaganda ‚Äù won‚Äôt lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated RT and Sputnik journalists on their work. 
In the Wednesday vote, 304 MEPs supported the resolution based on the report ‚Äò EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties ‚Äô, with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. 
Written by a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, Anna Fotyga, the report alleged that Moscow aims to ‚Äú distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens .‚Äù 
The report suggests that Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. 
At the same time, Russia is accused of ‚Äú information warfare ,‚Äù with such entities as RT TV channel, Sputnik news agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda ‚Äútools. ‚Äù 
The document places Russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). 
The report also mentions some ‚Äú social media and internet trolls ‚Äù from Russia who are thought to ‚Äú challenge democratic values .‚Äù 
It called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat, by means of ‚Äú investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media .‚Äù It also suggests stronger cooperation between the EU and NATO ‚Äú on strategic communication .‚Äù 
Sputnik has already appealed to the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and a number of international journalists‚Äô organizations and NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the EU. 
‚Äú The resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including Sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the EU. Moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the EU‚Äôs own human rights and freedom of press norms,‚Äù reads the letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. 
During the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, MEPs campaigning for the resolution said the EU was ‚Äú at war with Russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter ,‚Äù and that with an alleged ‚Äú aim to split Europe, the Kremlin forces its information into our countries .‚Äù ";english;2016-11-25T23:06:47.899+02:00;21stcenturywire.com;US;;EU Red Scare: Brussels Passes New Resolution to ‚ÄòCounter Russian Media Propaganda‚Äô;0.301;http://i1.wp.com/21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-RU-REd-SCARE-RT.jpg?fit=610%2C413;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
COLUMBUS, OH (AP) ‚Äî History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. 
The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. 
The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don‚Äôt vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. 
‚ÄúOver the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,‚Äù said AAB chairman Menno Simons. ‚ÄúWe have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nation‚Äôs highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord‚Äôs way.‚Äù 
According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. 
‚ÄúThe Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,‚Äù Silver noted. ‚ÄúThey also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.‚Äù 
The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,‚Äù Clinton wrote to the AAB. ‚ÄúAs a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.‚Äù 
Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs plea is too little too late. 
During a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because ‚Äúthe Amish do great work for a very low price.‚Äù 
Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. 
‚ÄúIt looked like she was going to win this election easily,‚Äù said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, ‚ÄúBut this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It‚Äôs really sad to see the campaign end this way.‚Äù

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) ‚Äî Following the results of Tuesday night‚Äôs election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. 
‚ÄúPeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,‚Äù Obama told reporters. ‚ÄúMany have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.‚Äù 
Under the President‚Äôs order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday‚Äôs election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. 
Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president‚Äôs decision. 
‚ÄúCrooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn‚Äôt allow that to happen. President Obama doesn‚Äôt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.‚Äù 
The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. 
‚ÄúWe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.‚Äù 
Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. 
‚ÄúMost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their states‚Äô electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.‚Äù 
Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President‚Äôs Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. 
‚Äú[The electoral college] is a f‚Äîking joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and that‚Äôs just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It‚Äôs time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.‚Äù 
Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWhy did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn‚Äôt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúIf all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.‚Äù 
If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administration‚Äôs special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.

In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. 
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. 
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia‚Äôs border. 
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia‚Äôs borders as part of a huge military deployment. 
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia‚Äôs borders since the Cold War. 
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. 
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a ‚Äúdeterrent‚Äù to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. 
‚ÄúThis is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,‚Äù NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday ‚Äî ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. 
Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to ‚Äòprevent conflict.‚Äô 
The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. 
The United States‚Äô envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO‚Äôs deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else‚Äôs lands. 
‚ÄúThis deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia‚Äôs) security posture,‚Äù Lute said. 
If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. 
These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. 
Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today.

In the video below the ‚Äúfolk hero‚Äù of the Iraqi Counter-Terror Services and regular Iraqi army takes a direct hit in the battle for Mosul. 
The destruction of an Abrams tank by a Russian ATGM Kornet missile is good news if you‚Äôre a stockholder in General Dynamics Land Systems, formerly Chrysler Defense. 
General Dynamics makes the Abrams battle tank. 
Each one costs $9 million. 
The US will simply ship another tank to replace the one destroyed along with its presumed Iraqi crew. Iraqi lives are a cheap commodity, so it will not be a problem to find another expendable tank crew. 
Back in 2012 former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno testified to Congress that the Army has more than enough tanks. He suggested the line at General Dynamics be shut down temporarily. ‚ÄúOur tank fleet is two and a half years old on average now. We‚Äôre in good shape and these are additional tanks that we don‚Äôt need,‚Äù he said. 
Congress budgeted more money for new tanks anyway. Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said more tanks were needed in Europe to confront Vladimir Putin. 
Military readiness is a ‚Äúconsumable,‚Äù said Maj. Gen. Thomas A. Horlander, the Army‚Äôs budget director. Military hardware is ‚Äúcumulative,‚Äù according to the Pentagon. 
On Tuesday General Dynamics stock opened at $151.21 and closed at $152.59. Last week the corporation was awarded a $170 million contract for an air-to-ground rocket system. Earlier this month General Dynamics was awarded a $900 million contract over five years to provide engineering and technical services for major weapon systems, program technical assistance, support systems requirements and assist with production decision-making and program controls, according to MarketWatch . 
The United States is the largest producer and exporter of weapons in the world. The US armed forces budget topped out over $600 billion in 2015.

Myanmar‚Äôs defacto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi of the National League for Democracy (NDL) political party, has paved her time since coming to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy. She has not only illegally declared herself ‚Äúleader‚Äù of the Southeast Asian state in contravention of its constitution, she has also embarked on an iron-fisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with. 
During elections earlier this year, Myanmar‚Äôs constitution prevented Suu Kyi from holding the nation‚Äôs highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas, her status of having been married to a foreign, and her children‚Äôs dual citizenship. Instead of adhering to the law, her party once in power, simply contrived an entirely new post for her, State Counsellor of Myanmar, which makes her the ‚Äúdefacto leader‚Äù of Myanmar. 
Canada‚Äôs The Globe and Mail in an article titled, ‚ÄúSt√©phane Dion says Aung San Suu Kyi is the ‚Äòde facto‚Äô leader of Myanmar,‚Äù would note that Canada‚Äôs government recognized this legal side-stepping, stating: 
Dion called Suu Kyi, now Myanmar‚Äôs foreign minister, ‚Äúthe de facto national leader‚Äù of her country ‚Äúbecause they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody who‚Äôs not of the country, you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state.‚Äù 
Suu Kyi, the internationally recognized democracy advocate, is barred from becoming president because her late husband was British, as are her two sons. The rule was crafted during Myanmar‚Äôs decades of military rule, which Suu Kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall. 
In essence, she is unelected, and illegally holding power. For a woman who‚Äôs Western backers ‚Äì particularly in the United States and United Kingdom ‚Äì have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law, she and her party‚Äôs first act upon taking power was trampling both. The Inhumane Humanitarian 
Another myth built up around Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi by the West has been her advocacy for ‚Äúhuman rights.‚Äù Her advocacy for human rights, however, appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned. For groups beyond this self-serving political protection, and particularly regarding her political opponents, she and her NDL are just as eager to jail, crush, or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been. 
In addition to escalating violence targeting the nation‚Äôs Rohingya‚Äôs population, several activists online have been sent to jail for ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù the ruling government and Western-backed media fronts and organizations. 
Myanmar‚Äôs Eleven Media Group (EMG) in its article, ‚ÄúFacebook offender brought to court for insulting Suu Kyi,‚Äù attempted to distance what Suu Kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now, a simple matter of enforcing the law. It would state: 
A Facebook user named Zaw Zaw (aka Nga Pha) was brought to the North Dagon Township court on October 24 to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. 
He has been charged under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. 
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the State Counsellor [posted on Facebook],‚Äù said plaintiff Nay Myo Kyaw, a 34-year-old resident of North Okkalapa Township. 
Around 50 people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the Network of Supporters of the Rule of Law. They shouted: ‚ÄúYou deserved it for insulting a good person.‚Äù 
The article also admits: 
The Myawady Township Court sentenced Aung Win Hlaing (aka A Nyar Thar), the first man to be prosecuted under the current government, for defamatory posts on Facebook about President Htin Kyaw, to nine months in jail after he was convicted under Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law. 
Aung Myint Tun (aka Ko Pho Htaung), a member of the National League for Democracy, is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter. 
Another man named Yar Pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake Facebook account under the name of Nay Myo Wai, the chairman of Peace and Diversity Party. 
Hla Phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on Facebook about the Commander-in-Chief. 
EMG ‚Äì ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous military-led government by Reporters without Borders ‚Äì would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of Myanmar‚Äôs laws to silence its own critics, claiming: 
Eleven Media Group (EMG) also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on Facebook against the group. Though EMG lodged complaints against film director Mike Tee, who is the owner of a Facebook account named Than Tun Zaw, and another Facebook user named Myat Maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff, the legal process has yet to begin. EMG lodged the complaints on January 27 and March 31 this year. 
One would expect such a tidal wave of abuse ‚Äì as defined by the West in regards to media, governance, and censorship around the world ‚Äì to be met with sweeping condemnation from the West‚Äôs various human rights advocacy organizations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and a no doubt embarrassed Reporters Without Borders ‚Äì yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling. Taking Over Where Accused Dictators Left Off 
The West‚Äôs champions of democracy, rule of law, and human rights in Myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where Suu Kyi and her NDL party had claimed the military-led government left off. And despite the overt nature of Suu Kyi‚Äôs breaches of Western standards of ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman rights,‚Äù the US is on track to lift all sanctions from Myanmar as Suu Kyi and her government open the nation, its people, and its resources to exploitation by Western corporations. 
The overt nature of both the West‚Äôs and Suu Kyi‚Äôs hypocrisy illustrates that ‚Äúdemocracy,‚Äù ‚Äúrule of law,‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù are merely facades behind which the West and its proxies wield their power ‚Äì hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them. And in reality, such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could ‚Äì because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the Western governments supporting the current regime in Myanmar, their faux-nongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime, and proxies like Suu Kyi and her NDL themselves. 
International audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the West attempts to overturn other governments in Southeast Asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric ‚Äì supporting supposed ‚Äúpro-democracy‚Äù and ‚Äúpro-human rights‚Äù advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power.

Part 1 of 4 
The following is the testimony I will present pro se [without a lawyer representing me] to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission‚Äôs Administrative Law Court, November 2 and 3, 2016 as a result of my not permitting an AMI Smart Meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by PECO, an Exelon Company that provides electricity and service to the suburban Philadelphia where I live. 
This testimony addresses most of the health, legal, and constitutional issues, plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and RF/EMF cancer-causing technology forced on consumers, along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an AMI Smart Meter. 
There are four parts to the entire testimony that was 18 pages long plus 195 pages of Exhibits A-1 thru W, and other documentation I had in my brief case (not presented but as backup, if needed) that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation, published research, etc. 
Personally, I think after reading the entire testimony, which will appear in four parts, readers can understand what‚Äôs involved with unsafe, fire-prone, and RF/EMF/dirty electricity-producing AMI Smart Meters when for decades utilities provided safe, non-plastic parts analog meters. Before the Administrative Law Court at the PA Public Utility Commission Philadelphia, PA ‚Äì November 2 & 3, 2016 
Your Honor, Judge Heep and Judge Pell, Members of the PA PUC, PECO Energy Company, the Exelon legal team, and all interested parties: 
Since today is the rescheduled postponed June 27, 2016 hearing and for which I, Catherine J Frompovich, submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules, I have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous 75 pages (10 pages of testimony and 65 pages of Exhibits A thru Q) that I submitted via the U.S. Postal Service and which all parties received, I presume. 
However, in view of the paramount importance, plus dire consequences, of EMFs/RFs being forced onto Pennsylvania consumers with no opt-out for personal safety and protection from 24/7/365 non-ionizing radiation emitted by AMI Smart Meters microwave technology, and my being a five-year breast cancer survivor, I submit into testimony and evidence that the PA PUC and all participating Pennsylvania utilities, not just PECO as in my case, must factor in the American with Disabilities Act Amendments, which redefine cancer as a disability, especially since there are cancer-causing effects from EMFs/RFs about which I submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of Exhibits per the Schedule of Exhibits I now introduce, plus printed documents I have with me in support of the four-page Bibliography of Pertinent Published Literature Regarding Electromagnetic Radiation, Cancer & AMI Smart Meters that I also submit into the record as Exhibit S . 
Since the ADA Amendments Act provides for three ‚Äúprongs‚Äù of what constitutes a disability, I am submitting into evidence a printout titled ‚ÄúAmericans with Disability Act Amendments Act (ADAAA)‚Äù pointing out appropriate and applicable sections Exhibit A-1 ; a two-page printout titled ‚ÄúADA Amendments redefine cancer as a disability‚Äù Exhibit A-2 ; along with a 43-page dossier containing about 240 published studies regarding BREAST and Other Cancers and EMF/ELF/RF Cancer Studies Exhibit A-3 ; and topping off those documents with a two-page letter dated 2 August 2016 from the foremost EMF/RF researchers, physicians and academics in the WORLD written to the North Carolina Utilities Commission Exhibit A-4 wherein in the third paragraph they state: 
Smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter RFR. Smart meter RFR consists of frequent, very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day. Because smart meter exposure over a 24 hour period can be very prolonged ( pulses can average 9,600 times a day ), and because there is building evidence that the sharp, high intensity pulses are particularly harmful , the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters. 
Those five researchers, David Carpenter, MD, Director, Institute for Health and the Environment, University of Albany Dr Lennart Hardell, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Oncology, University Hospital Orebro, Sweden Dr Magda Havas, BSC, PhD, Environmental & Resources Studies. Trent University, Canada Dr Martha Herbert, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Pediatric Neurologist and Neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston Dr Sam Milham, MD, MPH, Former chief epidemiologist, Washington State Department of Health 
point out in the last sentence of the first paragraph, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ it is imperative that the North Carolina Utilities Commission be fully aware of the harm that RFR can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty.‚Äù 
Frompovich respectfully points out, and also cautions the PA PUC, that in not permitting opt outs from AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania during formulating its AMI SM regulations, since HB2200 stated AMI SMs were NOT to be mandated , it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe AMI SMs regarding the RFRs they emit. Various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing AMI SMs opt outs, which the PA PUC deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding AMI SMs thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which, in essence, violate the Nuremberg Code since consumers‚Äô consent was not required nor asked, and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on PECO‚Äôs customers. 
Again, Frompovich points to the letter addressed to the NCUC Exhibit A-4 at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the U.S. NTP June 2016 study Conclusion in part stating ‚Äú‚Ä¶adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer .‚Äù 
Frompovich further elaborates that cell phone RFR exposure is elective , i.e., depending upon personal choice, use, and an individual‚Äôs ability to turn off cell phones, thereby reducing and/or avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and RFRs exposures both cell phones and AMI SMs produce. 
However, harmful personal bodily RFR exposure has been mandated by PA PUC Regulations‚Äînot HB2200/Act 129 (2008) and, therefore, is absolutely illegal, since Act 129 does not defy nor negate the Pennsylvania state constitution‚Äôs ‚ÄúInherent Rights of Mankind, Section 1‚Äù, but it‚Äôs the Commonwealth‚Äôs regulatory agency‚Äîthe PA PUC‚Äîthat is guilty of nonfulfillment, I allege: 
All men [and women] are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation , and of pursuing their own happiness. ‚Ä¶ Pennsylvania Constitution, Section 1. 
However, contrary to that Pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated AMI Smart Meter RFR exposure, because of no opt outs in Pennsylvania specifically via PA PUC Regulations not Act 129, literally provides no way to escape and/or avoid AMI SMs microwave RFRs. That is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally, Frompovich contends. Furthermore, the PA PUC overstepped its agency powers and, Frompovich contends, is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process. 
The above five researchers Exhibit A-4 delineate cell phone and Smart Meters as basically the same ‚Äúanimal‚Äù because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum! See paragraph 3 of their letter to the NCUC for more detail, including that Smart Meters over a 24-hour period can average 9,600 pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as ‚Äúdirty electricity .‚Äù 
I submit into the record Exhibit A-5 Dirty Electricity or Dirty Power and the 10-page report ‚ÄúWhy Are Electromagnetic Fields Dangerous? ‚Äì Is Dirty Electricity Making You Sick?‚Äù including 2 charts [ Table 1 Ranking Electric Meters and Table 2 Ranking Electric Meters for Risk of Privacy and Cyber Security] from the 20-page report ‚ÄúRanking Electricity Meters for Risk to Health, Privacy, and Cyber Security,‚Äù available online at https://www.scribd.com/doc/289782183/Ranking-Electricity-Meters-for-Risk-to-Health-Privacy-and-Cyber-Security . 
The KEY dispute and multi-faceted issue of concern in Frompovich‚Äôs case ‚Äì being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years ‚Äì is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear, exposure to cancer-causing EMFs, and/or actuality of contracting cancer due to AMI SM RFR exposures 24/7/365 in her home‚Äîsomething that the ADA Amendments Act indisputably encompass, since once a cancer patient that makes Frompovich covered within one of the ADAAA prongs for all time, and also includes Frompovich‚Äôs indefeasible right to protect property‚Äî both her home and her personal body and its life processes ‚Äîincluding her reputation. 
That federal ADAAA must be factored into Frompovich‚Äôs case since PECO has obtained federal grant monies to implement its AMI Smart Meters rollout, and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the ADAAA, including state regulatory agencies like the PA PUC. 
Frompovich‚Äôs refusal of an AMI SM, plus her human and innate right to protect her health, body and property, are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the strongest evidence for hazards coming from RFR is cancer , there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity (EHS).‚Äù See paragraph 4 of the letter to NCUC Exhibit A-4 . 
On page 2, paragraph 1 of that same letter, the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science, which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental, if not predictable , variances, as per the chart I raise up and submit into the record , a double-sided poster ‚ÄúRadiofrequency Research: Does Funding Matter,‚Äù which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics. 
Non-industry studies indicate 70% harmful effects with 30% no effects, while industry studies indicate 32 % harmful effects with 68% no effects! Statistically, that‚Äôs almost a wash, as each just about cancels the other, however, there‚Äôs a slight edge of 2% from non-industry studies indicating harmful effects. More interestingly, though, is that industry studies DID find 32% harmful effects studies‚Äîalmost one-third of the studies and, yet, the industry concludes differently stating there are none! That alone should be a red flag for them, or anyone of scientific mind, to investigate further and they did not, which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out. Is that a crime of omission or collusion? 
Paragraph 2 on page 2 of that letter Exhibit A-4 cites the obvious CRUX of scientific and ethical issues regarding AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania, in particular, stating ‚ÄúWith a leading [NC] DHHS staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature, and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance, the DHHS conclusion is not surprising.‚Äù 
Frompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred, and still occurs, with and from PECO and the PA PUC, thereby illegally depriving Frompovich and all Pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property, along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental AMI Smart Meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize non-thermal adverse health effects from RFRs, which have been known since 1932! I introduce Exhibit T Electrosensitivity (ES) and Electromagnetic Hyper-sensitivity (EHS) into the record to document that in 1962, 1979, 2009 and 2015 various health issues have been identified with EMF non-thermal exposures. 
Your Honors, I respectfully ask the court to instruct PECO to produce the experimental studies, rather than epidemiological studies, indicating no non-thermal effects from EMFs/RFs. Where‚Äôs the science? 
Aren‚Äôt PECO‚Äôs customers entitled to have that evidence? 
Frompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following: How much influence did the microwave industry contribute to PA State Representative Robert Godshall‚Äôs campaign coffers and/or his preferred charities that apparently has enabled Godshall, as Chair of the PA House Consumer Affairs Committee, to sit on opt out bills in the PA legislature for several legislative sessions, including Godshall‚Äôs verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote, which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving Pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fire-prone AMI SMs in Pennsylvania. 
Here‚Äôs what other U.S. states have done regarding AMI Smart Meters: 
Analog meters are definitively offered as the opt-out meter in four states: Arizona, California, Maine, and Texas. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the ‚Äúgreatest customer acceptance,‚Äù which, clearly, is the analog. 
Three states offer the ‚Äúexisting meter‚Äù as the opt-out meter. An existing meter might or might not be analog. Georgia, Hawaii, and Consumers Energy in Michigan. 
Three states let the utility decide: Florida, Maryland, and Nevada. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the ‚Äúgreatest customer acceptance,‚Äù which, clearly, is the analog. 
Four states or utilities definitively forbid analog opt-outs: Fountain in Colorado, DTE in Michigan, Central Hudson Valley in New York (AMR), and Port Angeles in Washington (touted as the first place to ban smart meters‚Äînot much help you are required to have a digital meter on your home!). 
Two states/districts require smart meters: Pennsylvania and Washington, DC.

This is the continuation of the testimony I will present before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission‚Äôs Administrative Law Court November 2 and 3, 2016. 
Currently, Chairman Representative Godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session, which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights, especially of redress to government, and also according to the Pennsylvania Constitution, I contend. 
Probably nothing encapsulates and explains the EMF/RFR controversy or conundrum, if you may, from a scientific viewpoint than the 35-page report ‚Äú EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMF-related health problems and illnesses ,‚Äù which is a Spanish language document and found online at https://listas.um.es/sympa/arc/anuncios/2016-07/msg00069.html This report cites 308 published scientific references, which leaves Frompovich to question why the PA PUC‚Äîand PECO in particular‚Äîare so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the 1940s era ‚Äòsafety‚Äô THERMAL science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ‚Äòancient‚Äô radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of ‚Äòsafety‚Äô. 
Those ‚Äòsafety‚Äô studies originated in Germany during World War II; are totally outmoded; but remain the present Federal Communications Commission‚Äôs rules regarding safety of cell phones and AMI Smart Meters. It is now 2016! How come 1940s microwave technology science is being applied as the ‚Äògold standard‚Äô or ‚Äòscientific criterion‚Äô to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the Internet of Things? Frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both PECO and the PA PUC for depending upon 1940 science in today‚Äôs technology world of 2016. Where‚Äôs the science later than the 1940s? Please, may I have those studies PECO supplied to the PA PUC? 
Frompovich, therefore, respectfully suggests that the PA PUC study the above-aforementioned European reports with medical and EHS health professionals, who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed, in order to issue updated regulations affecting AMI Smart Meters and their continuous RFR/EMF health-damaging electromagnetics, plus their fire-and-explosion-prone proclivities and occurrences, which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters. 
Children are the most vulnerable to EMF radiation and, therefore, I introduce Exhibit U-1 ‚ÄúWhy children absorb more microwave radiation than adults: The Consequences,‚Äù and Exhibit U-2 ‚ÄúAmerican Academy of Pediatrics August 29, 2013 letter urging the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, the Federal Communications Commission and others to advise the public about Specific Absorption Rates (SARs) regarding EMF/RF exposures.‚Äù 
Also, I want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity (EHS) is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ECOPSYCHOLOGY, Professor Pamela Reed Gibson states the following: 26% of the USA population; 19% of the Swedish population; 27% of the Danish population; and 32 % of the German population are EHS compromised. See Exhibit V . However, other sources claim that as much as 5% of the entire world‚Äôs population is affected. 
Just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for years‚Äînow referred to as ‚Äúsick building syndrome‚Äù or ‚ÄúMultiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS)‚Äîso, too, is EHS now being recognized by many, including the World Health Organization. I introduce Exhibit W ‚ÄúElectrohypersensitivity: a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment.‚Äù Printout available here https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=forums&srcid=MDgxODkwOTk5NjU5OTU4ODQwNTYBMTU3NTIzMDA1MTQxNTY1NzI0NTcBTVRzdGFEOUNBUUFKATAuMQEBdjI 
As Exhibit X I introduce a study no one can refute, ‚ÄúA review on Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and the reproductive system,‚Äù which outlines science the microwave industry, PECO and all utilities utilizing AMI Smart Meters, plus public utility commissions across the USA need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics 24/7/365 from dirty electricity pulsed by AMI SMs onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with AMI Smart Meters. 
Before I include my previously submitted testimony, I find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be Frompovich‚Äôs obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in light of the ADA Amendments Act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not, since the ADAAA provides Frompovich with disability rights and protections, which PECO and the PA PUC must abide by. 
Furthermore, it should be the indisputable duty of PECO and all Pennsylvania utility companies ‚Äì but more specifically that of the PA Public Utility Commission‚Äôs stated mission for being ‚Äì to provide safe and non-radiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with 100% certainty, which AMI Smart Meters fail on numerous levels, especially with their proclivity for ‚Äúhot sockets,‚Äù fires and explosions, EMF/RF constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as 9600 times a day! 
No medical-scientific testing has proved AMI Smart Meters EMFs safety regarding non-thermal adverse health effects that I know of. Where‚Äôs the science? 
Therefore, Frompovich should not be forced to allow a proven-fire-prone AMI Smart Meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high RFR pulses every fifteen seconds. 
Just to add more ‚Äúsalt to the wound,‚Äù as they would say, there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the AMI Smart Meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the Internet of Things, or that information will be shared with unknown third parties‚Äîfor whatever reasons‚Äîand for which Frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to PECO, the PA PUC or any government agencies or agents. 
Therefore, Frompovich feels her privacy, as well as her home and personal physiology, will be subjected to unlawful, unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and, specifically, without proper legal processes, e.g., court-issued warrants, in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the two-way ZigBee radio transmitter system of AMI SMs and all ‚Äúsmart‚Äù appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the Internet of Things. The times Frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no one‚Äôs business but her own. 
I‚Äôve been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively , including technologies, since the late 1970s. During my career, I was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states‚Äô legislature/legislative hearings on health issues. For numerous years I was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet, nutrition, epigenetics, and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health, avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles. 
I am in my 78 th year, thank God. Since the early 1970s, when I almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life, I‚Äôve been immersed in what‚Äôs called the ‚Äúholistic lifestyle.‚Äù I‚Äôve beaten the odds, including being a breast cancer survivor, using holistic healthcare modalities. For the record, 38.3% of U.S. adults and 11.8% of U.S. children used what‚Äôs referred to as CAM in 2007 per NIH statistics[1]. Complementary and Alternative Medicine‚ÄîCAM as it‚Äôs called, is popular throughout the world, while in the U.S. there is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health. 
However, the allopathic paradigm considers it, quite frankly, a pain in its professional butt since CAM has become the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù healthcare system when allopathy fails one. 
Therefore, I expect that I probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers, Wi-Fi, ‚Äòsmart‚Äô gadgets, and, in particular, AMI Smart Meters, which are being bully-forced onto electric, natural gas, and municipal water utility customers. Most state legislators, the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health. Fortunately, I am not one of those people, thus my refusing an AMI Smart Meter on my house. But, first I think you ought to know some of my background: I‚Äôm a well-informed, plus over 40 years published consumer health researcher, advocate-activist, journalist, and author. 
That I should be taken seriously, I offer some of my professional background: retired practicing natural nutritionist; former registered lobbyist with the U.S. Congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues; executive director for the national Coalition for Alternatives in Nutrition And Healthcare (CANAH) for five years and, as such, presented FDA-solicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its 1990 OTA report OTA-H-405 NTIS #PB91-104893[2] ‚ÄúUnconventional Cancer Treatments‚Äù [3]; expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation; government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; the first Government Relations specialist for the Life Extension Foundation, who set up LEF‚Äôs government relations department; a published journalist; author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on Amazon.com and my 2016 book, Eat to Beat Disease, Foods Medicinal Qualities. 
Additionally, I wrote and produced two TV shows. One called, ‚Äú Turn Off the Violence ‚Äù was nominated for a Telly Award. That hour-long show was instrumental in securing the Giraffe Award given to persons, who stick out their necks for the common good. The recipient was George Mason University staff member Connie Kirkland[4], who founded a 24-hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted on-campus non-violence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence. What I‚Äôve shared is much less than half of my background. More would take too much of your time. However, I feel compelled to ask, ‚ÄúHow many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues?‚Äù 
Furthermore, I want to underscore upfront that IF I were a habitual drug addict, rather than an informed, concerned health-conscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health, I probably would be welcomed with open arms, plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help. Because I am opposing faulty and health-damaging RF/EMF ‚Äòscience‚Äô, plus vested-interest snooping, surveillance, and customer data marketing agendas using AMI smart meters, I am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full. That leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Isn‚Äôt there something radically wrong with such a construct, especially in the USA, if I have to do that? 
Attorney Ward Smith‚Äôs interrogatory requesting Frompovich‚Äôs cancer health records, quite frankly, leaves everyone with whom I‚Äôve shared that fact, totally aghast and amazed! Why? Because Frompovich‚Äôs medical records are her personal information protected under HIPPA and I must protect them. Furthermore, since the PUC Administrative Law Court hearing is of public record, Frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings, as that is her fundamental right. 
I respectfully bring to this court‚Äôs attention that my breast cancer and medical records are NOT the issue. What‚Äôs the issue, problem, and at stake not only for me, but for all Pennsylvanians, is the total callous disregard by utility companies‚ÄîPECO included, the PA PUC, and the Commonwealth for health hazards, safety, and the wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians, especially those with health issues, compromised immune systems, disabilities, and especially young, growing children‚Äîfetuses in particular‚Äîwhom RF/EMF and dirty electricity produced by AMI Smart Meters affect and impact negatively. 
Before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotations‚Äînot 1940s vintage radar safety research‚Äîfor RFs/EMFs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health, I feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the AMI Smart Meter hidden costs continuum , and that is, healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from non-ionizing radiation RFs/EMFs Smart Meters impact upon human tissue. 
There are mounting underlying, long-term adverse health effects accruing as we speak from PA PUC-PECO forced AMI Smart Meter 24/7/365 RF/EMF electromagnetics, pulses, harmonics and dirty electricity, specifically adverse Non-thermal health effects, impacting children and an ageing PA population, which will generate dire fiscal consequences, plus responsibilities, upon Penna. Medicaid health cost line items in each year‚Äôs operating budget for the Commonwealth. 
To cement that forewarning, I offer the World Health Organization‚Äôs statistic, ‚ÄúApproximately 10% of reported cases of EHS [electromagnetic hypersensitivity] were considered severe,‚Äù which means specialized caregiving. That, however, does not include cancer-induced health issues from RFs/EMFs! What kind of budget shortfall will AMI Smart Meters adverse health effects eventually generate for PA‚Äôs legislature and governor to haggle about, when we‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs been going on recently to get a state budget passed? Has anyone thought about that very real problem?

Over the course of this year‚Äôs US presidential election, which has been nothing if not bizarre, some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment, leading to a suspension of the November election. Now, these theories appear to have more credence as sources within US intelligence have contacted Pat Milton, a CBS News senior investigative producer, warning him that terrorist attacks in three US states are highly likely come this Monday, the day before the US election. US Intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda, not ISIS, could be planning attacks in New York, Texas, and Virginia. No specific locations within those three states were mentioned. 
US authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously, though CBS News ‚Äô sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed. According to CBS , counter-terrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an ‚Äúabundance of caution.‚Äù 
Earlier this week, there were also warnings that ‚Äúpolling places‚Äù could be seen as ‚Äúattractive targets‚Äù for ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù attackers by individuals motivated by ‚Äúviolent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity.‚Äù This has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worst-case scenarios. One FBI official told CBS : 
The counter-terrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. 
However, what‚Äôs interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al Qaeda as opposed to the Islamic State. In the Syrian ‚Äúcivil‚Äù war, the US has been actively helping al Qaeda there, grouping their Syrian branch ‚Äì the al Nusra Front ‚Äì in with the ‚Äúmoderate rebels‚Äù they support. Therefore, al Qaeda‚Äôs ability to launch attacks within the US has been directly aided by US intelligence, making this announcement incredibly suspect. 
It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that al Qaeda, since its inception, has been a product of the US intelligence community. In the 1980s they were essentially created by the US to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ever since, they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of US wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically. 
It is also interesting that the threat is al Qaeda and NOT the Islamic State. The Islamic State has been the terrorist ‚Äúbogeyman‚Äù of recent years and their involvement in any threat, real or imagined, is useful justification for escalating US involvement in Syria. It seems highly likely that the Islamic State was left out due to recent revelations from WikiLeaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the Clinton Foundation. 
It is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass, it will be a big help for Hillary. Hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to WikiLeaks‚Äô near constant releases of her campaign chair‚Äôs emails, but also due to the FBI‚Äôs ‚Äúmutiny‚Äù which led them to re-open a probe into Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server. Any terror attack would give Clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in Syria and the rest of the Middle East. 
However, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is also possible that a terrorist attack on US soil would give President Obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election, something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, only time will tell which theory is correct, compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime.

By Joseph Jankowski 
An organization which has the aim to separate the state of California from the Union of the United States is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in Sacramento on Wednesday, November 9, 2016, the day after the presidential election. 
The Yes California Independence Campaign , which is based in San Diego, describes itself as a ‚Äúnonviolent campaign to establish the country of California using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so.‚Äù 
The group is currently trying to qualify a citizen‚Äôs initiative in 2018 to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in 2019, reports SF Gate . They will be in Sacramento in hopes to gather support for the state‚Äôs exit, or the ‚ÄúCalexit,‚Äù as they call it. 
‚ÄúIn our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,‚Äù reads Yes California ‚Äôs official website. 
The group‚Äôs page reads on: 
Although charity is part of our culture, when you consider that California‚Äôs infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law.
It is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. 
Yes California ‚Äôs website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a California exit from the US, including education, peace and security, debt and taxes and immigration. 
One blog post on their page draws parallels with a ‚ÄúCalexit‚Äù and the recent referendum known as ‚ÄúBrexit‚Äù that passed in the UK in June which showed that most British people are ready for their country to leave the EU. 
The push for secession is nothing new to California. In 1941 the mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, proposed the idea to push the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath to join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. 
Modoc County of Northern California voted in 2013 to join neighboring Siskiyou County in a push to secede from the State of California . 
In 2014, two counties in northern California petitioned for the right to form a 51st State of America, which they also wanted to name Jefferson.

One thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trump‚Äôs people try to say he doesn‚Äôt want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trump‚Äôs campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: 
‚ÄúThere are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy.‚Äù 
Conway immediately went on defense, saying, ‚Äúwow.‚Äù Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting ‚ÄòJEW-S-A‚Äô at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as ‚Äòdeplorable.‚Äô She responded: 
‚ÄúYes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe ‚Äî I hope you‚Äôve been to Trump rallies and I hope that you‚Äôve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, he‚Äôs had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans.‚Äù 
Tapper went on to say that no, he isn‚Äôt putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conway‚Äôs hand on this one: 
‚ÄúBut without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. 
Mr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,‚Äù Tapper continued. ‚ÄúHe just has. He says things like, ‚ÄúOh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.‚Äô But he has never serious said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.‚Äô He has never seriously done it.‚Äù 
Conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: 
‚ÄúI think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that we‚Äôre actually going to win in nine days because the idea that we‚Äôre going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week.‚Äù 
No, Kellyanne, it‚Äôs not a sign that Trump is winning. It‚Äôs pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and it‚Äôs all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because he‚Äôs one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better.

Donald Trump‚Äôs deplorable supporters aren‚Äôt waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. 
They‚Äôve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is ‚Äúrigged‚Äù in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. 
In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trump‚Äôs stupid hats and a ‚ÄúDeplorables‚Äù T-shirt to vote. 
Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. 
Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don‚Äôt apply to them. 
Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. 
At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. 
But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteer‚Äôs hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. 
‚ÄúIt just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who‚Äôs probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other,‚Äù local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . ‚ÄúI think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they‚Äôre going to vote and so there‚Äôs nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.‚Äù 
Here‚Äôs the video via KTVT . 
Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trump‚Äôs supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. 
Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you won‚Äôt hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. 
As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. 
In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt rent to the n-word,‚Äù and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. 
The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump‚Äôs run-in with the federal government over discrimination. 
Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. 
One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a ‚ÄúC‚Äù on the documents for ‚Äúcolored,‚Äù and that was a sign that they should be denied. 
The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs involvement with his father‚Äôs business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father‚Äôs $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization‚Äôs history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away ‚Äì it‚Äôs still there.

GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline ‚Äì and even bigoted ‚Äì stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect ‚Äúdeportation forces‚Äù to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one. 
According to the Associated Press , it turns out that Donald Trump‚Äôs wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor‚Äôs visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. 
So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: 
‚ÄúAs a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.‚Äù 
Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn‚Äôt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management ‚Äì a modeling agency. Also, there‚Äôs the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor‚Äôs visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania‚Äôs wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press . 
The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the ‚Äúother.‚Äù Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn‚Äôt completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.

If you had wanted to give Trump supporters the benefit of the doubt, this most recent incident proves that it‚Äôs far too much to give them. 
A 56-year-old man in Allen Park, Michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought they‚Äôd damaged the Donald Trump sign on his lawn. Yes, this is the kind of deranged, emotionally unstable supporters Trump has attracted. 
The man, Michael Robert Kubek, had called police on October 29th to report that his Trump sign had been hit by teenagers, who had fled the scene. When the police arrived at the scene, they didn‚Äôt find Kubek at his home ‚Äì however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. 
The police saw Kubek standing over six children ages 12-14, who were sitting on the grass. Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. 
According to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock: Twitter Twitter 
The News-Herald reported: 
‚ÄúThe officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not. The officer then asked Kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. According to police, Kubek said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù 
In response to another question from the officer, Kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered.‚Äù 
Yes, a grown man used a gun because he felt ‚Äúoutnumbered‚Äù by a small group of innocent kids. This is EXACTLY the type of unhinged person who shouldn‚Äôt be trusted with firearms! Kubek‚Äôs hearing is scheduled for December 5th ‚Äì let‚Äôs hope that whatever happens to Kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner. You can watch a report below:

Appearing at a concert for Hillary Clinton in Ohio alongside Chance the Rapper, Big Sean and her husband Jay Z, Beyonc√© let us all know why she‚Äôs ‚Äúwith her.‚Äù 
After explaining that she was so happy her nephew got to have Barack Obama to look up to and know he could one day be president, Beyonc√© then explained that this election is continuing on that path of progress. She explained that gender goes beyond that of any religion or race, and electing the first woman president is something she wants for her daughter. She said: 
‚ÄúI want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless.‚Äù 
Electing Hillary Clinton would break the mold of the United States being led by only men since its inception. However, that‚Äôs clearly not the only reason to elect Hillary. She is, by far, the most qualified person to run for President of the United States in more than a century.

Trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn‚Äôt hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star ‚Äòs Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump‚Äôs lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . 
There are literally hundreds of lies in Trump‚Äôs speeches. They‚Äôre not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. 
Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she‚Äôs actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. 
The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton‚Äôs policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton‚Äôs record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons‚Äô corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump‚Äôs endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama‚Äôs record, The campaign, Russia, Trump‚Äôs record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton‚Äôs health and Government corruption. 
They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, ‚ÄúThe electoral system is rigged.‚Äù Of course, it‚Äôs rigged against him: 
‚ÄúAfter plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. ‚ÄòRigged‚Äô became his catchword. 
He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired ‚Äòthugs‚Äô to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis ‚Äî cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. 
In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don‚Äôt trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice.‚Äù 
Nobody‚Äôs committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. 
Another is, ‚ÄúMuslims are risky.‚Äù This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: 
‚ÄúHis claims that Syrian refugees ‚Äî 99 per cent are Muslim ‚Äî are terrorists plays to the fears of the ‚Äúother,‚Äù even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump‚Äôs claims ‚Äî about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe polls favour Trump.‚Äù Har de har har ‚Äì Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they‚Äôre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: 
‚ÄúIt seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This ‚Äòpoll denialism‚Äô gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. 
His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling ‚Äî and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. 
On Oct. 24, he said ‚ÄòI won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.‚Äô In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. 
Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote ‚Äî and exaggerate ‚Äî those numbers.‚Äù 
But these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also: Falsely said on Twitter, ‚ÄúThe failing NYTimes reporters don‚Äôt even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúBy ‚Äòopen borders,‚Äô [Hillary] means totally unlimited immigration.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúHillary‚Äôs plan includes an open border with the Middle East.‚Äù Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, ‚Äúa Democrat.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúWow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible.‚Äù Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran ‚Äú$150 billion‚Äù as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, ‚ÄúIn San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people‚Ä¶Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.‚Äù Falsely asserted that Clinton has ‚Äúbeen fighting ISIS (her) entire adult life.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúAll together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.‚Äù Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO ‚Äúobsolete because it doesn‚Äôt cover terror;‚Äù falsely suggested NATO created an anti-terror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didn‚Äôt release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him ‚Äúhave been largely debunked.‚Äù Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, ‚ÄúThe one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense.‚Äù Falsely said ‚ÄúI did not. I did not‚Äù to Clinton‚Äôs charge that he thinks Climate change is a ‚Äúhoax perpetrated by the Chinese.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúI was against going into Iraq. And it‚Äôs so well-documented.‚Äù Falsely said, ‚ÄúOur taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world.‚Äù 
And so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, he‚Äôll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper‚Äôs lying, and continue to sell the myth that he‚Äôs not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.

Saturday Night Live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election, before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or ‚Äúdeplorable,‚Äù the cast of Saturday Night Live could not help but drop the act and get real with America. 
It began as it normally does, with Alec Baldwin‚Äôs masterful Donald Trump character and Kate McKinnon‚Äôs excellent portrayal of Hillary Clinton (if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine). 
‚ÄúI never use emails,‚Äù Trump says in the cold opener. ‚ÄúI use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it It‚Äôs called Twitter.‚Äù 
After he is informed that everyone can see his tweets, ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù replies: 
‚ÄúReally? And I‚Äôm still in this thing? America you must really hate this lady.‚Äù 
After a scathing rebuke of the media‚Äôs decision to ignore Trump‚Äôs cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, something magical happened: McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,‚Äù Baldwin says. ‚ÄúI just feel gross all the time about this. Don‚Äôt you all feel gross?‚Äù he added, addressing the audience. 
McKinnon agrees and the two embark on a ‚Äúfriendship montage‚Äù through the city before returning to the stage. Then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. ‚ÄúNone of this would have mattered if you don‚Äôt vote,‚Äù Baldwin says. 
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in,‚Äù McKinnon finishes.

As if the election of Donald Trump couldn‚Äôt get even more disastrous and hypocritical, Senator Lindsey Graham just called on Trump to nominate a right-wing extremist to nation‚Äôs highest court. 
All year long, Republicans have been blocking President Obama‚Äôs nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because they want the next president to make the pick. And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist. 
South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFF-TV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obama‚Äôs nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obama‚Äôs nominees. I expect them to give Trump‚Äôs nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you don‚Äôt honor Trump‚Äôs nominee, you‚Äôre making a huge mistake.‚Äù 
Democrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger. 
Since Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasn‚Äôt even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. That‚Äôs far from the ‚Äúfair shake‚Äù Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz. 
Putting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against women‚Äôs rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trump‚Äôs conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about ‚Äúfair shakes‚Äù before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump. Again, Senate Republicans didn‚Äôt even give Garland a hearing or a vote. They refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards President Obama. And so that‚Äôs exactly what Democrats should do to Trump. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans only have themselves to blame.

Trump fans may have won the election, but they aren‚Äôt taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of Michelle Obama. The Donald‚Äôs Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue. 
‚ÄúI could have spent eight years doing anything , and at some level, it would have been fine,‚Äù Obama told the magazine . ‚ÄúI could have focused on flowers. I could have focused on decor. I could have focused on entertainment. Because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. There‚Äôs no legislative authority; you‚Äôre not elected. And that‚Äôs a wonderful gift of freedom.‚Äù 
In exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans ‚Äî and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate. The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an ‚Äúape‚Äù and a ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes. 
If you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong. Trump fans are not done by a long shot ‚Äî and now they have been emboldened by America electing its first official KKK candidate. 
It will get worse before it gets better.

As predicted, Donald Trump‚Äôs victory on Election Day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities. 
And it‚Äôs even happening in the deep blue state of California, where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of Pittsburg and snapped a photo of it. 
Twitter user James Thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him. This picture was taken in Pittsburgh California. My sister texted this to me 10 minutes ago.Our democracy is being tested even in California pic.twitter.com/gDLKw54Lox 
‚Äî James Thompson (@JETBallin) November 13, 2016 
The sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent African-Americans from getting equal rights. 
‚ÄúYou can hang a n****r from a tree / Equal rights he will never see!‚Äù it says. 
The FBI has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it. 
In the wake of Trump‚Äôs surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country. In fact, there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by Trump supporters since the election night results. 
These incidents include the harassment of a Muslim teacher by a student in Georgia, and students designating water fountains ‚Äúwhite‚Äù or ‚Äúcolored‚Äù at a Florida high school. 
Frankly, there are so many incidents that it‚Äôs difficult to list them all. You can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here . 
This is what Trump‚Äôs America looks like and it‚Äôs scary. And this has all happend in the course of a few days as Melania Trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying. What exactly does she mean by that? Is she going to call out all bullying, including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husband‚Äôs own supporters? Or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband. Because right now, she isn‚Äôt even First Lady yet and her ‚Äúeffort‚Äù has failed miserably. And she only has her husband to blame.";english;2016-11-14T01:53:53.917+02:00;addictinginfo.org;FR;5772.0;Racist Sign Calls For Lynching Black People To Prevent Them From Getting Equal Rights;0.0;http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CxGrYz8UAAAkiYB1-800x430.jpg;0;0;2;0;2;bias

It‚Äôs a common stereotype that food stamp recipients, and those who abuse it, are black, Hispanic, or any other race but white. According to the USDA in their report for fiscal year 2013, 40% of recipients are white and 26% are black. Courtesy of Travissonno.com 
While the media and America‚Äôs culture will have you believe that black people (or anyone who isn‚Äôt white) account for copious amounts of fraud, there‚Äôs a story breaking that you won‚Äôt hear on Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù anytime soon (or you might, because any chance to crush the SNAP program, they will take). 
According to WCAX News in New York: 
More than 30 people have been nabbed for food stamp fraud in the North Country. 
Investigators say over the past couple month‚Äôs people used their food stamps to get food or alcohol at the Old Time Butcher Block store in Brushton. 
Police also say it‚Äôs not the first time the owner of that store, Dennis Sauve, has been charged with allowing such fraud. 
Police say more arrests are expected. 
Now here‚Äôs the kicker: they‚Äôre all white. Brushton, New York, where this bust happened, has a population of roughly 480 people. Approximately 99.83% of the population is white, and 0.42% are black. These demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country , Owsley Country, Kentucky, which is 99.22% white and 95% Republican. Maybe we should investigate them. 
I just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in Brushton. 
According to WPTZ News: 
Police say the arrests are the result of a year-long investigation, initiated by the Franklin County Department of Social Services Fraud Unit. Franklin County District Attorney‚Äôs Office, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance helped with the investigation. 
The store owner, Denis Sauve (also white), has been charged with third-degree grand larceny and misuse of food stamps. 
This really isn‚Äôt a racial issue so much as it is an, ‚ÄúI told you so,‚Äù issue. While the food stamp program has one of the lowest rates of abuse than any other welfare program, a lot of people buy into this misconception that it is the ‚Äúlazy blacks‚Äù who account for all the fraud and woes of government assistance. Well, here we are, a major food stamp ‚Äúbust‚Äù and every criminal involved is white.

In reaction to Donald Trump‚Äôs victory, The Simpsons decided to update their 2000 prediction of a Trump presidency. 
In 2000, the show showed a glimpse into the future where President Lisa Simpson inherited an economic mess from ‚ÄúPresident Trump.‚Äù Well, now that fictional story line has become a horrifying reality. 
Here is The Simpsons new opening with Bart Simpson writing on the chalkboard, ‚ÄúBEING RIGHT SUCKS‚Äù: The Simpsons updates its 2000 prediction of a Trump Presidency‚Ä¶ #TheSimpsons pic.twitter.com/Myf5rYb9Dj 
‚Äî The Simpsons (@TheSimpsons) November 14, 2016 
Hopefully, the financial despair the fictional President Trump never becomes a reality, but seeing as he has no experience, is a businessman who‚Äôs not as good as he says he is, and The Simpsons have been right thus far, the future‚Äôs looking pretty bleak. 
Here‚Äôs the original clip of President Lisa Simpson calling out a Donald Trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy: 
Early on into Trump‚Äôs campaign, The Simpsons satirized the reality TV host turned president-elect by having Homer Simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into Trump‚Äôs hair. If we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality. 
Now we have to reap what we‚Äôve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting Americans have sown considering Trump only won with the Electoral College and lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in his own words, big league. 
Most of us with The Simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.

It was just a few days ago that Bernie Sanders responded to Trump‚Äôs election win with the perfect message from Democrats. He said : 
‚ÄúIf Donald Trump takes people‚Äôs anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.‚Äù 
And from what was just announced, it seems that Sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. Earlier today, the Vermont Senator was named chair of outreach during a closed-door Senate Democrat caucus meeting, according to The Hill . In his new role, Sanders will lead outreach to blue-collar voters ‚Äî the very voters who became Trump supporters this year. Sanders will also be the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Acknowledging that he has a ‚Äúheavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the United States government,‚Äù Sanders said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do everything that I can to make sure that the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires.‚Äù With the announcement of Sanders‚Äô new position, Trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck. He‚Äôs spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class, and now Sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years. By elevating Sanders to this new role, Democrats are moving to a more grassroots message, fully aware that Sanders‚Äô presidential campaign and vision for America resonated with many voters. As we saw with Sanders‚Äô popularity in the primaries, the Vermont Senator struck a nerve with workers and families, making him the perfect candidate to go up against Trump as he takes office. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) commented on Sanders‚Äô new responsibility: ‚ÄúWe want to expand on that, and he will be reaching out to all our allies. We have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing.‚Äù Sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset Trump, as he‚Äôs been one of the most outspoken politicians on Twitter since Trump‚Äôs win: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
However, Sanders‚Äô new role is great news for our country, and we know he‚Äôs going to give Trump hell.

Donald Trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and he‚Äôs only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the President-elect. 
On Monday, Trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. 
Some reporters in attendance were NBC‚Äôs Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC‚Äôs James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS‚Äô Norah O‚ÄôDonnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News‚Äô Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC‚Äôs Phil Griffin; and CNN‚Äôs Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. 
Unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it , ‚ÄúIt was like a f*cking firing squad.‚Äù 
Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post , one anonymous source said: 
‚ÄúThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.‚Äù 
This claim was backed up by another person, who said: 
‚ÄúThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. 
‚ÄúTrump kept saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars.‚Äù 
This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. 
Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is: Twitter Twitter Twitter 
Interestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: 
‚ÄúExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.‚Äù 
Disgraceful.

San Francisco, California ‚Äì It was an agreement four years in the making, oftentimes marred by shouting matches among city hall officials, representatives of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, merchants and homeowners. But the Halloween party in San Francisco‚Äôs gay Castro district finally returns in 2014. 
It will be recalled that the Halloween bash attracted as many as 500,000 each year and has become a major tourist attraction, second and third only to the Pride parade and Folsom Street Fair. Stabbing and shooting incidents, believed to be perpetrated by straight revelers, prompted city officials to permanently ban the event beginning in 2010. 
As part of the agreement, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Castro Halloween will be open only to members of the LGBTQ community who will have to register with city hall and be included in a ‚Äúgay registry.‚Äù Registrants, who will take an oath admitting that they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or questioning, will be issued special identification cards linked to the official registry. The IDs will be the only accepted pass to gain entry to the Halloween event. ID‚Äôs will be scanned at entrances to the event to confirm that individuals are listed in the official registry.

MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) ‚Äì This is a tutorial on how to ride the jeepney which is an important mode of mass transportation in many cities and towns in the Philippines. 
Many of you may already be familiar with these rules, etiquette and tricks but for those who are visiting the country for the first time or are returning nationals (balikbayan) who have been away for a long time, you might want to keep this tutorial handy. First of all, not all jeepneys you encounter are as colorful, shiny and clean as the one pictured here. If you are bothered by smoke or the smell of gasoline, remember to always carry and wear a disposable surgical mask. It also helps with, you know, body odor. In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you. Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you can‚Äôt argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat. Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. ‚ÄúBarya lang po sa umaga!‚Äù No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please. Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know. If you don‚Äôt want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant. The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. ‚ÄúGod knows who doesn‚Äôt pay,‚Äù says one jeepney sign. There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: ‚ÄúBayad po‚Äù (here‚Äôs my fare) and ‚ÄúPara po‚Äù (this is my stop). If you don‚Äôt speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepney‚Äôs roof. It also means ‚Äúplease stop.‚Äù There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say ‚Äúone senior‚Äù or ‚Äúone student‚Äù when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare. Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isn‚Äôt that nice? As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride.

It would be pancit, that signature noodle dish closely identified with the Philippines. 
When asked by The Adobo Chronicles why she chose pancit, Comerford said that pancit represents long life and a ‚Äòlong term,‚Äô meaning she was hoping Hillary would be elected to a second four-year term like her predecessor and current boss, President Barack Obama.

SAN FRANCISCO, California ( The Adobo Chronicles, San Francisco Bureau) ‚Äì Now it can be told ‚Äî now that Hillary Clinton is all but assured of the Democratic presidential nomination. 
For months since the former secretary of state launched her presidential bid, her campaign logo has always symbolized America‚Äôs quest to move forward, with the arrow in the logo pointing to the right. Left-handed people, of course, dispute that symbolism because for them, moving forward should be pointing to the left. 
But there is another school of thought about Hillary‚Äôs logo. Many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the (conservative) right as opposed to the (liberal) left. 
The logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the Democrats win over Republican voters in the general elections ‚Äî voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate. 
The GOP‚Äôs presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, is perceived by many as more leftist than rightist, which would give Clinton the edge among conservative voters. 
Who knew the placement or direction of an arrow could spell victory or defeat for an American presidential candidate?

MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) ‚Äì Rappler CEO Maria Ressa‚Äôs widely-quoted statement, ‚ÄúTime to take back the Internet‚Äù might just come back to haunt her. Just in time for Halloween. 
Ressa has been very vocal about the proliferation of ‚Äúfake‚Äù news sites and trolls that have left her online news organization lagging behind in terms of followers and reader engagements. She was particularly critical of entertainer-turned-political blogger, Mocha Uson, who has more than 4 million followers, twice that of Rappler. 
Now, the Philippine government may soon ‚Äòtake back the Internet‚Äô from Rappler because it appears it has violated the Philippine Constitution. 
Article XVI, Section 11 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution specifically states that the mass media must be wholly-owned and managed by citizens of the Philippines. 
But Rappler is partly-owned by a foreign company, Omidyar Network. How do we know? Rappler itself told us so way back on November 5, 2015: 
So, before Rappler can take back the Internet, it may first have to give it up!

Instead, the billionaire candidate will establish his own White House outside of Washington, D.C. ‚Äî as a matter of fact two of them : one in Florida and another in Nevada. Trump‚Äôs White House (s) will be headquartered in the Trump hotels in Doral and Las Vegas. 
‚ÄúThis will bring the White House ‚Äî and the president ‚Äî closer to the people,‚Äù Trump declared. He also indicated that he will not be using Airforce One or Marine One. Rather, he said he will be using his own private jet at no cost to the taxpayers. 
The Adobo Chronicles asked Trump what will happen to the media and the White House press corps when he travels across the country or abroad. 
‚ÄúWell, they just have to book their own commercial flights and follow me around,‚Äù he said. 
Thousands of miles away in the Philippines, a leading presidential candidate said that if elected president, he will not live in Malaca√±ang ‚Äî the Filipino counterpart of the White House ‚Äî because he likes to sleep in his own bed. His bed is in Davao City of which he is currently the mayor. 
Rodrigo Duterte said he will commute daily from Manila to Davao using a private jet of his friend. Davao is about a hour and forty-five minutes by plane from Manila, which is a far way shorter commute than being stuck in daily traffic on Metro Manila‚Äôs streets.";english;2016-11-12T01:24:50.353+02:00;adobochronicles.com;US;;Comment on If Elected President, Donald Trump Will Not Live In The White House by Rebecca Bennett;0.0;https://adobochroniclesdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/image.jpeg;0;1;0;0;0;fake

Washington, D.C. (The Adobo Chronicles) ‚Äì It is common knowledge that Ronald Reagan loved mac n‚Äôcheese. Bill Clinton, before his heart bypass, indulged in jalape√±o cheeseburgers. How about Barack Obama? 
In an exclusive interview with White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford, she indicated that Obama does not have one particular favorite food. ‚ÄúBut he loves Filipino cuisine,‚Äù she said. 
Comerford, a Filipino American, has so far served as executive chef under three U.S. Presidents ‚Äì George W. Bush, Clinton and Obama. She is the first woman and the first of Asian descent who has served as White House executive chef. Halo-Halo 
‚ÄúThere are so many Filipino foods that the president likes, but on top of his list is halo-halo, the Filipino version of the Hawaiian shaved ice,‚Äù Comerford said. Asked to name the top ten Filipino foods fancied by Obama, Comerford gave us the following list:

3. Balut (duck embryo) 
5. Kinilaw na Kambing (ceviche-style goat meat) 
6. Tocino (sweet cured pork) 
7. Laing (spicy taro leaves) 
8. Pinakbet (Filipino version of ratatouille)

CUPERTINO, California ( The Adobo Chronicles, San Jose Bureau) ‚Äì Technology giant Apple is known for its innovation and for constantly reinventing itself and its products. This strategy has spelled the company‚Äôs tremendous success across the globe. 
Occasionally, Apple immerses itself in politics and the current political atmosphere following the election of Donald Trump as the 45th U.S. president is one of those times. 
By now, the term Alt-Right (Alternative Right) has become a familiar phrase especially on social media. 
The Alternative Right, commonly known as the Alt-Right, is a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that ‚Äúwhite identity‚Äù is under attack by multicultural forces using ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù to undermine white people and ‚Äútheir‚Äù civilization. Characterized by heavy use of social media and online memes, Alt-Righters eschew ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù conservatism, skew young, and embrace white ethno-nationalism as a fundamental value. 
In keeping up with this new political atmosphere, Apple has just announced that it will be replacing all keyboards on its desktops, laptops, iPhones and iPads with a new design that adds the ‚ÄúAlt-Right‚Äù key. The key will be located in the lowermost right corner of the keyboard. How appropriate 
Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the addition of this all-important key will enable those who subscribe to the Alternative Right ideologies (and idiosyncrasies) to identify themselves when sending emails, texts or posting on social media. Hitting the ‚ÄúAlt-Right‚Äù key will automatically add the hashtag #AlternativeRight to whatever a person is typing on the keyboard.

MANILA, Philippines ( The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) ‚Äì Advertising company McCann Worldgroup Philippines will be in charge of crafting the new tourism campaign of the country, the Department of Tourism (DOT) said over the weekend. 
Tourism undersecretary for advocacy and public affairs Katherine de Castro said the P650-million contract with McCann, which won the bid to be the advertising and promotions partner of the DOT for one year, includes the production and positioning of marketing materials, as well as the formulation of a new tourism slogan. 
The Adobo Chronicles spoke with a McCann spokesperson who informed us that the slogan selected for the 2017 tourism year is a take-off from the previous ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs More Fun in the Philippines.‚Äù 
The new slogan is ‚ÄúMore Fun in P.I.‚Äù 
P.I. of course stands for Philippine Islands (although the country is now known by the acronym of ‚ÄòPH.‚Äô) 
But it also stands for ‚ÄòP*tang Ina‚Äô (Son of a Whore), the cuss words often heard from President Rodrigo Roa Duterte in his speeches and interviews. 
‚ÄúPresident Duterte‚Äôs rhetoric and cussing have put the Philippines on the world map and we would like to capitalize on that,‚Äù the McCann spokesperson said.

The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat‚Äôs campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. 
The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by Wikileaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state‚Äôs email practices. 
Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta‚Äôs birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik‚Äôs son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign.

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. ‚Äî More than 100 of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs biggest donors crowded into the home of Casey and Laura Wasserman here on Thursday night, each having written a check for at least $33,400 to snag a ticket. The Hollywood glitterati in attendance ‚Äî Elton John performed on the piano; Barbra Streisand mingled in the crowd ‚Äî were sending her off for the home stretch of the campaign with north of $5 million in fresh funding. 
It was a fitting capstone to a remarkable 18 months for Clinton on the lucrative California fundraising circuit, this final event anchored by a host committee of billionaires, Hollywood executives, media moguls and tech investors ‚Äî Sean Parker, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Haim Saban, Chris Sacca ‚Äî that each directed $416,000 to Clinton‚Äôs efforts. 
Clinton calls them her ‚ÄúHillblazers,‚Äù campaign bundlers who have given or raised at least $100,000 for her campaign. And she has erected an unparalleled and unprecedented infrastructure of 1,133 such people ‚Äî nearly double the number of any past presidential candidate, including President Obama four years ago. 
While Clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors, it is these bundlers in more than 40 states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation. Combined, this elite $100,000-and-up club has amassed a minimum of $113 million for Clinton and the Democratic Party ‚Äî and the actual figure is likely far, far higher than that. (The biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns.) 
‚ÄúWe had the best base of donors and bundlers and raisers ever in 2008. It was even better in 2012. And it‚Äôs much better in 2016 than 2012,‚Äù said Wade Randlett, a San Francisco-based Democrat who has raised money for Clinton, Obama and Democratic causes for decades. ‚ÄúThe Obama people basically 100 percent in are favor of Hillary. There‚Äôs really no loss because of ideology or bad blood. And she has added an enormous number of people, especially women.‚Äù 
Among her bundlers are celebrities (Will Smith) and sports stars (Earvin ‚ÄúMagic‚Äù Johnson), Hollywood directors (Steven Spielberg and George Lucas) and corporate executives (Marissa Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg), Wall Street-types (Marc Lasry), media executives (Haim Saban and Anna Wintour) and members of Congress, including her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, who helped raise more than $100,000 for Clinton before he joined the ticket in July. 
The Clinton campaign said 45 percent of its bundlers are women. 
There are also federal lobbyists, from whom the Democratic Party under Obama refused to accept money, a prohibition that has since been rolled back. 
This club has expanded to the point where Clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom. As of the end of June, she counted 496 such individuals and couples. By the end of July, it was 871. On August 31, it was 1,133. 
It includes billionaires George Soros, Warren Buffett and Tom Steyer, super lobbyists like Steve Elmendorf and bold-faced names like Calvin Klein and J.J. Abrams. There is also a sprinkling of longtime Clinton family advisers, such as Vernon Jordan.";english;2016-10-27T00:19:57.290+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Hillary has built the biggest big-money operation ever;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14774971911.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

In an email released by Wikileaks, top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin seemed to express concern for the health of her boss. 
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to stick to notes a little closer this am, still not perfect in her head,‚Äù Abedin told Podesta and others in a discussion on messaging to reporters about a Jeb Bush Super PAC. 
It appears that Abedin wasn‚Äôt the only person concerned about Hillary‚Äôs health. 
In an email dated September 26, 2015, John Podesta asked Jennifer Palmieri, ‚ÄúHow bad is her head?‚Äù 
Palmieri responded, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know.‚Äù 
A post at Heat Street observed: 
Hillary Clinton suffered a ‚Äúcracked head‚Äù (her words) after suffering a fall in December 2012. Many have speculated about her health since that episode, and questions grew louder in September of this year when Hillary was caught on tape nearly collapsing at a 9/11 memorial event in Manhattan. 
After initially blaming the health scare on ‚Äúdehydration,‚Äù the campaign was forced to acknowledge the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia. 
‚ÄúIt was unclear whether Abedin was referring to a serious ailment,‚Äù the New York Post added. 
In January 2016, Breitbart reported: 
Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton‚Äôs disappearance from the debate stage last month left people speculating that the former First Lady took a long bathroom break, but now a law-enforcement source with inside connections is alleging that Clinton was missing from the stage due to health issues stemming from a previous brain injury. 
These long-lasting symptoms stemming from a concussion and blood clot, according to a neurologist, suggest Clinton is suffering from post-concussion syndrome, which can severely impact her cognitive abilities.

Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign has ended fundraising events meant to support the Republican Party‚Äôs get-out-the-vote efforts in next month‚Äôs elections. 
Aides to the Republican nominee told Fox News that Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee for the GOP and the campaign, held its most recent fundraiser on Oct. 19 and no more such events were scheduled. 
The move, which was first reported by The Washington Post, cuts off a key money source for Republicans hoping to keep hold of both houses of Congress. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve kind of wound down,‚Äù Trump national finance chairman Steven Mnuchin told the Post. ‚ÄúBut the online fundraising continues to be strong.‚Äù 
By contrast, the Post reported that Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign has scheduled 41 fundraising events between now and Nov. 4. The former secretary of state was scheduled to make her last personal fundraising appearance Tuesday in Miami. 
Mnuchin told the paper that the real estate mogul was focusing on making his final pitch to the voters at a campaign events rather than raising money in the final two weeks of the race. 
‚ÄúWe have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],‚Äù Mnuchin said of the candidate. ‚ÄúUnlike Hillary, who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.‚Äù 
According to the Post, the Republican National Committee had collected $40 million through Trump Victory as of Sept. 30. 
RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the organization ‚Äú[continues] to fundraise for the entire GOP ticket.‚Äù

When Breitbart News‚Äô Washington political editor, Matthew Boyle, confronted Mook about Creamer and his firm in the spin room after the third presidential debate, Mook claimed: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve never worked for our campaign.‚Äù When asked if Clinton had ever discussed the controversial political operations with Creamer directly, Mook replied: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù 
Now, however, O‚ÄôKeefe and Project Veritas have released video of Creamer claiming that Clinton directly approved one of his more bizarre plans ‚Äî an effort to attract media attention and incite violence by dressing an activist in a Donald Duck costume and sending that activist into Trump events, emphasizing the argument that Trump was ‚Äúducking‚Äù releasing his tax returns. 
The action, if true, would be a black-letter violation of federal election law, which prohibits presidential campaigns from coordinating activities with outside groups that can collect unlimited ‚Äòdark money‚Äô from contributors ‚Äì and don‚Äôt pay taxes on what they collect.

The party‚Äôs Foreign Affairs spokesman, Tom Brake, obtained a parliamentary letter from UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, in which he acknowledged that the British government provides the training to Saudi pilots bombing civilians in Yemen. Brake denounced the move as ‚Äúshameful,‚Äù calling on the Ministry of Defense to end the training immediately. ‚ÄúThe Government must end its complicity in this murderous campaign,‚Äù he said.

The Liberal Democrats also wanted to know what the instructions and advice had been given by the British government on authorizing military operations and the ‚Äútargeting of aerial operations‚Äù over the last year.

Former President Bill Clinton can be heard telling his former mistress, Gennifer Flowers, to deny that he helped her get a state job in a series of recorded phone conversation from 1991. 
‚ÄúIf they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no,‚Äù Clinton is heard saying in the recording. 
At the time, the media was making inquiries about Flowers‚Äô alleged affair with Clinton, and she was concerned that they may question how she got a job as administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal. 
Clinton can also be heard telling Flowers how to handle a grievance filed by soemone else who applied for the same positioned and claimed she was more qualified than Flowers. 
Flowers famously recorded a series of conversation she had with Clinton from December 1990 to December 1991, while he was still Governor of Arkansas. The audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the 1990‚Äôs, however, as other pay-for-play financial scandals have surfaced, the details may warrant revisiting.

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clinton‚Äôs have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn‚Äôt plan to allow her or Bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e-mail server to gun-running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. 
Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration, John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million Nantucket mansion in June 2016 as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama‚Äôs purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams, however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. 
The Bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family, since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 9-11, the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bush‚Äôs plan on getting out of the country as well. 
Interestingly, the Bush family‚Äôs Nazi connections dating back to WWII seem to have played a part in the Paraguay purchase since most Nazis fled to South America after WWII. Since George H. W. Bush‚Äôs father Senator Prescott Bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the Nazis, the Bush family has a long history of being associated with Nazis. 
With the movement of huge amounts of funds, selling millions of dollars in real estate, and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas, we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in Washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions, murdering US citizens in the thousands, and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since 9-11 finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed. 
We are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a Nazi Dictatorship in Washington to an actual Presidential Administration who not only will look to the Constitution as the basis of all laws, but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people, for the people, and of the people of the USA. Not the Dictatorship over the people, to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power.";english;2016-10-27T15:12:28.983+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Hillary Planning Her Escape After a Trump Win With a $1.8 BILLION Money Transfer to QATAR;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14775656811.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

Sioux Falls, IA | During his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton allegedly had sexual intercourse with cattle off of Tom Brady‚Äôs family dairy farm. 
The family farm which was owned by Tom Brady‚Äôs father at the time, Willow Brady Jr., was often visited by the Clinton family when they were in the area. 
‚ÄúMy dad and Bill Clinton‚Äôs step dad were like brothers. They often visited us on the holidays when I was a kid. Bill even knew the cows names by heart. That always surprised me‚Äù recalls the 64-year-old, third-generation dairy farmer.

During the 1992 Iowa caucus, the Clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the Brady‚Äôs farm, a night Tom Brady says he will never forget. 
‚ÄúThe Clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs, that‚Äôs when everything went wrong‚Äù he recalls, visibly distraught by the whole affair. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about all those stories about him sexually assaulting women, but I sure as hell know he assaulted one of our cows because I was there and I saw him do it with my own eyes and believe me, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd wish my worst enemy to live to see‚Äù he told local reporters.

Bill Clinton has been personally accused publicly by seventeen women of sexual misconduct between 1972 and 1997.

Two Bill Clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the Clinton Foundation ‚Äî and even called the arrangement ‚ÄúBill Clinton Inc.‚Äù 
Doug Band, a top Clinton aide, detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company, Teneo, and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked e-mails released Wednesday by WikiLeaks. 
‚ÄúTeneo partners have raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation, more than $5.25 million of which is in the bank,‚Äù the memo reads. 
‚ÄúTeneo partners also have generated over $3 million in paid speeches for President Clinton, $1.25 million of which has been paid to him thus far.‚Äù 
The consulting company was formed by Band and former State Department envoy Declan Kelly. The memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president. 
In one arrangement, Kelly introduced Bob McCann, the head of UBS Wealth Management, to Clinton at an event in 2009. 
After the meeting, McCann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting Clinton to give several paid speeches. 
Another arrangement involved the Laureate Foundation, which donated more than $1 million to the Clinton Global Initiative. 
Laureate was a ‚Äúpersonal advisory services business,‚Äù the memo said, paying Clinton ‚Äú$3.5‚Äâmillion annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman.‚Äù 
The cozy relationship with the Clintons put the Baltimore-based Laureate at high-profile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe. 
The Band memo also includes a section about ‚ÄúFor-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e., Bill Clinton Inc.).‚Äù 
Some of the speeches ‚Äúsecured‚Äù by Teneo include two $450,000 addresses delivered to UBS in 2011 and 2012, as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches, if he chose to give them. 
Another secured event was a $1 million fee for Clinton to speak at two one-hour sessions during an event in Hong Kong. The fee included $400,000 for a private plane. 
‚ÄúSince 2001, President Clinton‚Äôs business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements,‚Äù the memo reads. 
The relationship between Band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter Chelsea Clinton in another e-mail. 
Chelsea specifically called out Band and Teneo for ‚Äúhustling‚Äô‚Äù business opportunities out of the foundation. 
‚ÄúI continue to want ‚Äî and to try ‚Äî to disintermediate myself from this muddle, edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in ‚Äî while also being a responsible board member, daughter and person,‚Äù Chelsea wrote in the 2011 e-mail. 
The relationship between foundation donors and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs State Department was raised through e-mails obtained by Citizens United in which top Hillary aide Huma Abedin appeared to vet donors‚Äô access to the Clintons based on their links to the CGI. 
In a December 2012 e-mail in which a CGI official asks for Band and a few others to meet with Hillary during a trip to Ireland, Abedin writes to Band, ‚ÄúAre these legit cgi people?‚Äù";english;2016-10-27T15:12:29.028+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Clinton cronies steered millions to foundation ‚Äî and Bill‚Äôs wallet;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14775653191.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. ‚ÄúIf we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs trillions of dollars over the next decade.‚Äù 
Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,‚Äù he argued. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still battling recession, I don‚Äôt care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we‚Äôre not doing anything about it.‚Äù 
He added that it was ‚Äúlazy American women‚Äù who brought about the downfall of the economy, because ‚Äúthey sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we‚Äôre here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúMark my words and mark them well,‚Äù he addressed the crowd. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she‚Äôs a woman herself and not just any woman; she‚Äôs a self-made woman. So you better believe what she‚Äôs saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSecond, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She‚Äôs been all that and she‚Äôs learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,‚Äù Biden continued. 
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs women are pampered and aren‚Äôt used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,‚Äù the vice president said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they‚Äôve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.‚Äù 
‚ÄúNow, that‚Äôs all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it‚Äôs the economy that‚Äôs missing out on valuable workforce. And that‚Äôs why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,‚Äù Biden concluded.";english;2016-10-27T15:12:29.046+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Biden Blames ‚ÄúLazy American Women‚Äù For The Economy: ‚ÄúThey Sit Around Doing Nothing, Only Hillary Can Force Them To Work‚Äù;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14775651301.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP SIGNALED THURSDAY PLANS TO SEEK NATIONWIDE CHANGES TO SCHOOL CURRICULA WITH THE GOAL OF ‚ÄúPROMOTING AMERICAN PRIDE AND PATRIOTISM IN AMERICA‚ÄôS SCHOOLS.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIn a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America‚Äôs children,‚Äù Trump said, speaking at the American Legion‚Äôs annual convention in Cincinnati. 
‚ÄúWe want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America‚Äôs history, its institutions and its heroes, many of whom are with us today,‚Äù he told the veterans group. 
The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law‚ÄúWe will stop apologizing for America. And we will start celebrating America. We will be united by our common culture, values and principles, becoming one American nation, one country, under one Constitution, saluting one American flag, and always saluting it,‚Äù Trump said. 
Last year a Denver-area school board sought to change the content of the AP U.S. history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism. 
That sparked a political proxy war in Jefferson County, Colorado, and the 2015 school board election drew nearly $1 million in campaign funding from outside interest groups. 
Public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding.

The Politico/Morning Consult Poll finds that 41 percent of voters think widespread voter fraud could cause the GOP nominee to lose the election. Amid Trump's increased warnings about a ""rigged election,"" 73 percent of Republicans think the election could be stolen from him, compared to 17 percent of Democrats. 
Over the past week, Trump has cast doubt on the American electoral system, saying he believes the results will be ""rigged"" at many polling places. 
""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary ‚Äî but also at many polling places ‚Äî SAD,"" Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday. 
Trump has also encouraged supporters to keep an eye on voting locations to prevent fraud, which some say is a ploy to intimidate voters.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arranged a $12 million donation from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to her family‚Äôs charity in 2014 in return for the Clinton Global Initiative hosting its international meeting in the North African Muslim nation, according to an email made public Thursday by Wikileaks. 
The Moroccan monarch‚Äôs funds went to the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs endowment and to CGI. The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks‚Äô latest batch of communications to and from Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. 
The email from Huma Abedin, Clinton‚Äôs Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. 
Singapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a five-star hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGI‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst choice.‚Äù 
The actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. 
The mining company also contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charity‚Äôs web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton ‚Äúcreated this mess and she knows it,‚Äù she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. ‚ÄúThis was HRC‚Äôs idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.‚Äù HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
Abedin said Clinton‚Äôs attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the $12 million contribution. ‚ÄúJust to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,‚Äù Abedin said. 
Politico in 2015 reported that Clinton ‚Äúwas seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration.‚Äù Rabat is the capital of Morocco. 
The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with ‚Äúserious human rights violations,‚Äù including exploitation of workers by not ‚Äúadequately compensating the impoverished people who live there.‚Äù 
Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by AL-Monitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that ‚ÄúOCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation ‚Äî it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.‚Äù 
Polisaro claims to lead a Moroccan government-in-exile based in Tindouf, Algeria. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara,‚Äù Beisat charged. 
The Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCP‚Äôs mining product ‚Äúblood phosphates,‚Äù appropriating the term ‚Äúblood diamonds‚Äù for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers 
OCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a $100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo. (RELATED: Clinton Foundation Got $100M From ‚ÄòBlood Minerals‚Äô Firm) 
OCP retained the law firm of Covington & Burling, one of Washington‚Äôs lobbying giants, paying the firm $1.4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015. 
Stuart Eizenstat, a former White House domestic policy chief under President Carter and an influential Democratic Party insider, was the main lobbyist for the mining firm. He was also President Bill Clinton‚Äôs ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. 
Eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration. 
Hillary Clinton officially visited Morocco twice, in November 2009 and in February 2012, meeting with the King on both occasions. The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Morocco‚Äôs bid to host the CGI meeting and the King‚Äôs $12 million donation. 
The Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing ‚Äúrenewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs esteem for Morocco and its people.‚Äù 
Abedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clinton‚Äôs relationship with the King. ‚ÄúIt will break a lot of china to back out now,‚Äù she wrote. 
Ultimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan King‚Äôs palaces.";english;2016-10-27T21:11:19.331+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;WIKILEAKS: Hillary Got $12 Million for Clinton Charity As Quid Pro Quo For Morocco Meeting;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/1477586403hillary-clinton-wikileaks-morocco.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton."" The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rival's calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trump's remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,"" he said. Trump: I'd 'love' to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, anti-government rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia -- which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and US-allied rebels -- to combat ISIS. ""Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,"" Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria to help bring the five-year civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would ""save lives and hasten the end of the conflict,"" while cautioning that ""this would not be done just on the first day."" ""This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground,"" Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. ""I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS."" Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians -- as has Clinton -- which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trump's rhetoric. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously ill-prepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. ""Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports."" Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putin's ""puppet,"" Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, ""How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil."" And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. ""If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" he told Reuters.

Donald Trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the November election will be rigged against him. 
""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning. ""Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" 
It's a charge that even other Republicans have been quick to refute. Critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the US democratic process. 
""States, backed by tens of thousands of GOP and DEM volunteers, ensure integrity of electoral process,"" Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is often sharply critical of Trump, tweeted Sunday. ""Elections are not rigged."" 
Jon Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state, also said Monday that he could assure Trump the election would not be rigged. 
Trump's most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls. Before now, Trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early August. 
""And I'm telling you, November 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,"" the New York billionaire told Fox News host Sean Hannity in August. ""And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us."" 
Multiple Republicans told Business Insider at the time that Trump's assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous, as Trump would be the first US presidential candidate in modern times, possibly ever, to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election. 
Allen Raymond, a former GOP operative who was involved in the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone-jamming scandal, called Trump's continued insistence that the election would be rigged ""detrimental to the Republic."" 
""The idea that it's rigged, I don't know what he's talking about,"" he said in August. ""I know someone that rigged elections. I mean, you know, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton doesn't need to rig this election. Trump's going to win Alabama and that's it. She doesn't have to do anything. It's painful to watch."" 
Raymond wrote ""How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative"" as a tell-all about the attempt to rig the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election between then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Republican US Rep. John E. Sununu. Raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the New Hampshire Democrats office in Manchester ‚Äî a task his phone bank was hired to carry out. Sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20,000 votes. Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch in 2008. 
The operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvement.He said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that ‚Äî not what Trump's talking about. 
The Manhattan billionaire told The Washington Post in August that a lack of voter-identification laws would let people ""just keep voting and voting and voting"" and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against Republican nominee Mitt Romney because there were ""precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican."" 
""I don't even know what he's talking about,"" Raymond said. ""But this idea that it's 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines ‚Äî that's nonsense. An election rigging these days means something totally different than what he's talking about. Now it's stupid stuff like what I did in New Hampshire."" 
He said the lack of voter-ID laws Trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus. 
""These voter-ID laws, what's the intention of that? The clear intention is disenfranchisement,"" he said, echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voter-ID laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots. ""You know, there's a reason we don't have a poll tax anymore. Because it's unconstitutional. 
""People don't vote 10 times,"" he continued. ""There might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times, but he's talking about an institutional effort. It's a total myth."" 
He said Trump's statements were an attempt to ""basically sideline"" Hillary Clinton's first four years in office. 
The idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the Democratic National Committee had its emails hacked and leaked, though both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton's main opponent in the Democratic primary, had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season. The emails showed that the organization, which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary, favored Clinton. 
Trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was ""rigged"" against Sanders in his early-August interview with Hannity, in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail. He used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well.";english;2016-10-27T21:11:33.687+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Donald Trump claims the election will be 'rigged' ‚Äî and critics have called that preposterous and dangerous;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/1477585908donald-trump-1.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: ‚ÄòSometimes agreements can‚Äôt be made‚ÄôAfter being asked by a voter at a Charleston, South Carolina, town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict, the GOP contender vowed to give it ‚Äúone hell of a shot‚Äù and called it ‚Äúprobably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.‚ÄùBut when pressed by host Joe Scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord, Trump declined to take sides. 
‚ÄúYou know, I don‚Äôt want to get into it, because ‚Ä¶ If I win, I don‚Äôt want to be in a position where I‚Äôm saying to you and the other side now says, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt want Trump involved,'‚Äù Trump said. 
‚ÄúLet me be sort of a neutral guy,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúA lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don‚Äôt want to say whose fault is it. I don‚Äôt think it helps.‚ÄùTrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs not makeable, because don‚Äôt forget it has to last ‚Äî it‚Äôs wonderful to make it and it doesn‚Äôt work, but it has to last,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but I‚Äôm going to give it a shot.‚Äù 
Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. 
‚ÄúA lot of people say an agreement can‚Äôt be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements can‚Äôt be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it‚Äôs impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time they‚Äôre children to hate Jewish people.‚ÄùIn the past, Trump has questioned Israel‚Äôs commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‚Äúa good friend.‚Äù 
At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don‚Äôt know that the other side has the commitment to make it.‚Äù 
He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: ‚ÄúA lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal ‚Äî whether or not Israel‚Äôs willing to sacrifice certain things,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey may not be, and I understand that, and I‚Äôm okay with that. But then you‚Äôre just not going to have a deal.‚Äù

Former President Bill Clinton can be heard telling his former mistress, Gennifer Flowers, to deny that he helped her get a state job in a series of recorded phone conversation from 1991. 
‚ÄúIf they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no,‚Äù Clinton is heard saying in the recording. 
At the time, the media was making inquiries about Flowers‚Äô alleged affair with Clinton, and she was concerned that they may question how she got a job as administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal. 
Clinton can also be heard telling Flowers how to handle a grievance filed by soemone else who applied for the same positioned and claimed she was more qualified than Flowers. 
Flowers famously recorded a series of conversation she had with Clinton from December 1990 to December 1991, while he was still Governor of Arkansas. The audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the 1990‚Äôs, however, as other pay-for-play financial scandals have surfaced, the details may warrant revisiting. 
Here is a transcript of part of the recording: 
GF ‚Äì But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It‚Äôs just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, ‚ÄúWell, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,‚Äù and then uh, ‚Äúthey told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there. 
BC ‚Äì Good for you. 
GF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn‚Äôt cancer. And it‚Äôs been almost, it‚Äôll be two years in May that she‚Äôs now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he‚Äôs doing good. And I am, I‚Äôm really, Bill what I‚Äôm afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I‚Äôm working for the state. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. 
GF ‚Äì They‚Äôre going to make a big deal of it. 
BC ‚Äì Yeah. 
GF ‚Äì Well the only thing that concerns me, where I‚Äôm, where I‚Äôm concerned at this point is the state job.

Democratic U.S. vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine announced Saturday that he believes the Catholic Church will change its position on same-sex marriage. The Virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue, the Catholic Church is also likely to follow suit. Speaking at the 20th Annual Human Rights Campaign‚Äôs National Dinner in Washington, the Roman Catholic senator reportedly said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who, in the first chapter of Genesis, surveyed the entire world, including mankind, and said, ‚ÄòIt is very good.‚Äô‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd besides,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúwe are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value. By definition, that means that every single person and every single citizen is able ‚Äì no, scratch that ‚Äì encouraged to practice his civil, religious, and above all, sexual liberties to the best of their abilities. And I‚Äôm sorry that some people don‚Äôt like it, but to deny same-sex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless. And the Catholic Church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it, which is what it‚Äôs doing right now.‚Äù 
Kaine also added that, if all else fails, ‚Äúthere are ways of making the Catholic Church listen to the voice of reason,‚Äù which is how he dubbed all those who advocate LGBT equality. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, you know, we‚Äôre a civilized people, of course the first thing we‚Äôll do is act nicely and ask nicely,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen, if that doesn‚Äôt work, we‚Äôll use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are, or rather the LBGT community will do that ‚Äì and it has. The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling on same-sex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works, it actually functions.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo, what I‚Äôm saying here,‚Äù he argued, ‚Äúis that, while I respect the Catholic Church as I‚Äôm sure millions of Americans do, you know, at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the Christian faith, and we‚Äôre talking about an institution that‚Äôs supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it. So, when that happens, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening with condemning LGBT rights, we‚Äôll state an ultimatum. The United States of America, more precisely, the future President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton, will state an ultimatum. And that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on same-sex marriage or pack its bags and get out of America. And yes ‚Äì the President of the country can do that.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd in case anybody‚Äôs wondering ‚Äì no, Donald Trump won‚Äôt do the same because he doesn‚Äôt care about anyone other than Donald Trump. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton is a shining example of honesty, integrity and democracy, and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout America are loved, respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term. What happens after that is not our problem,‚Äù Kaine concluded.";english;2016-10-27T21:11:57.771+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Tim Kaine: ‚ÄúThe Catholic Church Will Change Its Same-Sex Marriage Stance Or It Will Be Banned From The U.S.‚Äù;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14775661401.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

An internal memo released Wednesday by WikiLeaks reveals how a longtime Clinton confidant played an ""unorthodox"" dual role ‚Äì raising money for the Clinton Foundation and finding paid work for Bill Clinton, The Hill reports. 
The 12-page document written in 2011 by Doug Band of Teneo, a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed ""Bill Clinton, Inc."", the Washington Examiner reports. 
In one instance, Band secured a $540,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation from banking giant UBS. He later arranged for Bill Clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of $900,000, The Hill reported. 
But in his memo, Band argues his double duties were ""independent"" of one another; the memo was written after Chelsea Clinton criticized Band's role within the family's network of interests, The Hill reports. 
""In the unique roles in which we have had the opportunity to serve, we have been able to help balance the multiplicity of activities that demand [Bill Clinton's] time and engagement to best fulfill his personal, political, business, official former President, and Foundation/non-profit goals,"" Band writes. 
According to The Hill, Teneo's overlapping responsibilities worried some in the Clintons' inner circle, and in one email published by WikiLeaks, Chelsea Clinton raised ""serious concerns"" with Teneo's liberal use of the Clinton name to court clients. 
Band lashed out, calling the former first daughter a meddlesome ""spoiled brat"" in one hacked email released by WikiLeaks. 
""We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the [tax exempt] status of the Foundation,"" Band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism, The Hill reports. 
Band co-founded Teneo with former State Department employee Declan Kelly while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state ‚Äì and paid Bill Clinton as an adviser through 2012, The Hill reports. 
Band's memo lists several Teneo clients that he and Kelly ""leveraged"" into major donors for the foundation, and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the Clintons and the prospective donors, The Hill reports. 
One that Kelly ""cultivated"" was Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent, which led to seven-figure donations beginning in 2009. 
In a previous hacked email to Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Band worried the press might catch wind of his role and misconstrue it. 
""I'm starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed,"" Band wrote. 
""[Kelly] and I built a business. Our business has almost nothing to do with the Clintons, the foundation or [the Clinton Global Initiative] in any way. The chairman of UBS could care a less [sic] about CGI."" 
A week after Band sent his memo, Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills sent a document to Podesta and Band laying out ways to unwind the former president's charitable and business interests ‚Äî all of which distanced Band from the foundation. 
In December 2011, the former president resigned his position on Teneo‚Äôs advisory board, The Hill reports.";english;2016-10-27T21:12:01.325+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;WikiLeaks: Clinton Confidant Raised Money for Foundation, Got Bill Paid Gigs;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14775658391.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clinton‚Äôs have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn‚Äôt plan to allow her or Bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e-mail server to gun-running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. 
Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration, John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million Nantucket mansion in June 2016 as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama‚Äôs purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams, however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. 
The Bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family, since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 9-11, the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bush‚Äôs plan on getting out of the country as well. 
Interestingly, the Bush family‚Äôs Nazi connections dating back to WWII seem to have played a part in the Paraguay purchase since most Nazis fled to South America after WWII. Since George H. W. Bush‚Äôs father Senator Prescott Bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the Nazis, the Bush family has a long history of being associated with Nazis. 
With the movement of huge amounts of funds, selling millions of dollars in real estate, and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas, we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in Washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions, murdering US citizens in the thousands, and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since 9-11 finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed. 
We are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a Nazi Dictatorship in Washington to an actual Presidential Administration who not only will look to the Constitution as the basis of all laws, but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people, for the people, and of the people of the USA. Not the Dictatorship over the people, to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power.";english;2016-10-27T21:12:03.459+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Hillary Planning Her Escape After a Trump Win With a $1.8 BILLION Money Transfer to QATAR;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14775656811.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

Sioux Falls, IA | During his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton allegedly had sexual intercourse with cattle off of Tom Brady‚Äôs family dairy farm. 
The family farm which was owned by Tom Brady‚Äôs father at the time, Willow Brady Jr., was often visited by the Clinton family when they were in the area. 
‚ÄúMy dad and Bill Clinton‚Äôs step dad were like brothers. They often visited us on the holidays when I was a kid. Bill even knew the cows names by heart. That always surprised me‚Äù recalls the 64-year-old, third-generation dairy farmer.

During the 1992 Iowa caucus, the Clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the Brady‚Äôs farm, a night Tom Brady says he will never forget. 
‚ÄúThe Clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs, that‚Äôs when everything went wrong‚Äù he recalls, visibly distraught by the whole affair.

Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. ‚ÄúIf we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs trillions of dollars over the next decade.‚Äù 
Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,‚Äù he argued. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still battling recession, I don‚Äôt care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we‚Äôre not doing anything about it.‚Äù 
He added that it was ‚Äúlazy American women‚Äù who brought about the downfall of the economy, because ‚Äúthey sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we‚Äôre here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúMark my words and mark them well,‚Äù he addressed the crowd. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she‚Äôs a woman herself and not just any woman; she‚Äôs a self-made woman. So you better believe what she‚Äôs saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSecond, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She‚Äôs been all that and she‚Äôs learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,‚Äù Biden continued. 
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs women are pampered and aren‚Äôt used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,‚Äù the vice president said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they‚Äôve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.‚Äù 
‚ÄúNow, that‚Äôs all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it‚Äôs the economy that‚Äôs missing out on valuable workforce. And that‚Äôs why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces.

REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP SIGNALED THURSDAY PLANS TO SEEK NATIONWIDE CHANGES TO SCHOOL CURRICULA WITH THE GOAL OF ‚ÄúPROMOTING AMERICAN PRIDE AND PATRIOTISM IN AMERICA‚ÄôS SCHOOLS.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIn a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America‚Äôs children,‚Äù Trump said, speaking at the American Legion‚Äôs annual convention in Cincinnati. 
‚ÄúWe want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America‚Äôs history, its institutions and its heroes, many of whom are with us today,‚Äù he told the veterans group. 
The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law‚ÄúWe will stop apologizing for America. And we will start celebrating America. We will be united by our common culture, values and principles, becoming one American nation, one country, under one Constitution, saluting one American flag, and always saluting it,‚Äù Trump said. 
Last year a Denver-area school board sought to change the content of the AP U.S. history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism. 
That sparked a political proxy war in Jefferson County, Colorado, and the 2015 school board election drew nearly $1 million in campaign funding from outside interest groups. 
Public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money. Most schools receive little federal funding. 
Current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising ‚Äúany direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system.‚Äù";english;2016-10-27T21:12:36.705+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;TRUMP CALLS FOR TEACHING ‚ÄòPATRIOTISM‚Äô IN SCHOOLS;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14775649831.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

The Politico/Morning Consult Poll finds that 41 percent of voters think widespread voter fraud could cause the GOP nominee to lose the election. Amid Trump's increased warnings about a ""rigged election,"" 73 percent of Republicans think the election could be stolen from him, compared to 17 percent of Democrats. 
Over the past week, Trump has cast doubt on the American electoral system, saying he believes the results will be ""rigged"" at many polling places. 
""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary ‚Äî but also at many polling places ‚Äî SAD,"" Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday. 
Trump has also encouraged supporters to keep an eye on voting locations to prevent fraud, which some say is a ploy to intimidate voters. 
Trump is trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls following sexual assault and harassment allegations from multiple women. 
The Politico/Morning Consult poll showed Clinton leading Trump by 5 points, 46 to 41 percent. 
In a RealClearPolitics polling average, Clinton leads Trump by 5.5 points, 47.7 to 42.2 percent. 
While Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and even Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, have tried to reassure the electorate about the reliability of the election system, the poll released Monday found 60 percent of Americans think it is necessary to question the accuracy of the election results.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arranged a $12 million donation from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to her family‚Äôs charity in 2014 in return for the Clinton Global Initiative hosting its international meeting in the North African Muslim nation, according to an email made public Thursday by Wikileaks. 
The Moroccan monarch‚Äôs funds went to the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs endowment and to CGI. The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks‚Äô latest batch of communications to and from Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. 
The email from Huma Abedin, Clinton‚Äôs Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. 
Singapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a five-star hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGI‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst choice.‚Äù 
The actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. 
The mining company also contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charity‚Äôs web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton ‚Äúcreated this mess and she knows it,‚Äù she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. ‚ÄúThis was HRC‚Äôs idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.‚Äù HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
Abedin said Clinton‚Äôs attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the $12 million contribution. ‚ÄúJust to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,‚Äù Abedin said. 
Politico in 2015 reported that Clinton ‚Äúwas seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration.‚Äù Rabat is the capital of Morocco. 
The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with ‚Äúserious human rights violations,‚Äù including exploitation of workers by not ‚Äúadequately compensating the impoverished people who live there.‚Äù 
Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by AL-Monitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that ‚ÄúOCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation ‚Äî it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.‚Äù 
Polisaro claims to lead a Moroccan government-in-exile based in Tindouf, Algeria. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara,‚Äù Beisat charged. 
The Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCP‚Äôs mining product ‚Äúblood phosphates,‚Äù appropriating the term ‚Äúblood diamonds‚Äù for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers 
OCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a $100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo. (RELATED: Clinton Foundation Got $100M From ‚ÄòBlood Minerals‚Äô Firm) 
OCP retained the law firm of Covington & Burling, one of Washington‚Äôs lobbying giants, paying the firm $1.4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015. 
Stuart Eizenstat, a former White House domestic policy chief under President Carter and an influential Democratic Party insider, was the main lobbyist for the mining firm. He was also President Bill Clinton‚Äôs ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. 
Eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration. 
Hillary Clinton officially visited Morocco twice, in November 2009 and in February 2012, meeting with the King on both occasions. The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Morocco‚Äôs bid to host the CGI meeting and the King‚Äôs $12 million donation. 
The Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing ‚Äúrenewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs esteem for Morocco and its people.‚Äù 
Abedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clinton‚Äôs relationship with the King. ‚ÄúIt will break a lot of china to back out now,‚Äù she wrote. 
Ultimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan King‚Äôs palaces.";english;2016-10-27T21:14:42.326+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;WIKILEAKS: Hillary Got $12 Million for Clinton Charity As Quid Pro Quo For Morocco Meeting;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/1477586403hillary-clinton-wikileaks-morocco.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton."" The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rival's calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trump's remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,"" he said. Trump: I'd 'love' to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, anti-government rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia -- which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and US-allied rebels -- to combat ISIS. ""Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,"" Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria to help bring the five-year civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would ""save lives and hasten the end of the conflict,"" while cautioning that ""this would not be done just on the first day."" ""This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground,"" Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. ""I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS."" Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians -- as has Clinton -- which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trump's rhetoric. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously ill-prepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. ""Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports."" Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putin's ""puppet,"" Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, ""How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil."" And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. ""If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" he told Reuters. That complaint didn't put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet -- a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.";english;2016-10-27T21:14:42.443+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Trump warns of World War III if Clinton is elected;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/1477586227636130853168961052.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

""Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's mind about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you are doing the work of our adversaries for them.""

Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on Tuesday, looking to further its portrayal of Hillary Clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through ‚Äúpay-to-play politics.‚ÄùThe TV spot hits Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, on controversies related to her family‚Äôs foundation, stating that ‚Äústaggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America‚Äù and that ‚ÄúHillary cut deals for donors.‚Äù 
Clinton‚Äôs charitable foundation has faced intense scrutiny this election over concerns about possible conflicts of interest because it took in money from corporations and foreign governments. Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation‚Äôs work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton ‚Äúsold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.‚Äù‚ÄúHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,‚Äù its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and high-profile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husband‚Äôs character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen.

Leading Republican presidential hopeful suggests Israeli-Palestinian peace accord may be impossible: ‚ÄòSometimes agreements can‚Äôt be made‚ÄôAfter being asked by a voter at a Charleston, South Carolina, town hall event hosted by MSNBC about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict, the GOP contender vowed to give it ‚Äúone hell of a shot‚Äù and called it ‚Äúprobably the toughest agreement of any kind to make.‚ÄùBut when pressed by host Joe Scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either Israelis or Palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord, Trump declined to take sides. 
‚ÄúYou know, I don‚Äôt want to get into it, because ‚Ä¶ If I win, I don‚Äôt want to be in a position where I‚Äôm saying to you and the other side now says, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt want Trump involved,'‚Äù Trump said. 
‚ÄúLet me be sort of a neutral guy,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúA lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I don‚Äôt want to say whose fault is it. I don‚Äôt think it helps.‚ÄùTrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a two-state solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs not makeable, because don‚Äôt forget it has to last ‚Äî it‚Äôs wonderful to make it and it doesn‚Äôt work, but it has to last,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo make lasting peace there? Probably the toughest deal of all, but I‚Äôm going to give it a shot.‚Äù 
Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. 
‚ÄúA lot of people say an agreement can‚Äôt be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements can‚Äôt be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says it‚Äôs impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time they‚Äôre children to hate Jewish people.‚ÄùIn the past, Trump has questioned Israel‚Äôs commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‚Äúa good friend.‚Äù 
At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don‚Äôt know that the other side has the commitment to make it.‚Äù 
He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day: ‚ÄúA lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal ‚Äî whether or not Israel‚Äôs willing to sacrifice certain things,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey may not be, and I understand that, and I‚Äôm okay with that.

The second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could ""be in jail"" if he's elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. 
ABC's Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. 
""As I told you, that was locker-room talk,"" Trump said. ""I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it."" 
Trump then said if you ""look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women"" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. 
Three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. 
""Mine were words ‚Äî his were actions,"" Trump said. 
""So, don't tell me about words,"" he continued. ""I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.""

‚Äî CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that ""so much of what he just said is not right"" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. 
""I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,"" she said. ""When they go low, you go high.""

Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on Tuesday, looking to further its portrayal of Hillary Clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through ‚Äúpay-to-play politics.‚ÄùThe TV spot hits Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, on controversies related to her family‚Äôs foundation, stating that ‚Äústaggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America‚Äù and that ‚ÄúHillary cut deals for donors.‚Äù 
Clinton‚Äôs charitable foundation has faced intense scrutiny this election over concerns about possible conflicts of interest because it took in money from corporations and foreign governments. Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundation‚Äôs work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton ‚Äúsold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.‚Äù‚ÄúHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself,‚Äù its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks.

The second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could ""be in jail"" if he's elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. 
ABC's Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. 
""As I told you, that was locker-room talk,"" Trump said. ""I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and I'm not proud of it."" 
Trump then said if you ""look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women"" as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. 
Three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. 
""Mine were words ‚Äî his were actions,"" Trump said. 
""So, don't tell me about words,"" he continued. ""I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.""

‚Äî CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that ""so much of what he just said is not right"" but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. 
""I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all,"" she said. ""When they go low, you go high."" 
""And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable,"" she said. ""But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything.""

Hillary Clinton declared during NBC News‚Äôs Commander-in-Chief forum that no lives were lost in Libya when she made the move to take out dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Even so, the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that 11 months later four Americans ‚Äì including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens ‚Äì were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created. 
‚ÄúThat was one of the few situations in American foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we don‚Äôt make the wrong move, and the operation was a success, even Donald Trump supported it,‚Äù Clinton argued. ‚ÄúAs with any operation of such magnitude, we had a few hiccups, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. As I‚Äôve said, the operation was a success.‚Äù 
She continued, ‚ÄúSo much so, in fact, that I‚Äôm proud to say that no important people were lost through it all, and when I say that, I say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that Libyans could be freed from the iron fist of Gaddafi. It would have been unrealistic to expect 0 casualties; however, the overall toll did not exceed expectations, with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy.‚Äù 
‚ÄúPolitics can be a cruel line of work. That being said, I stand before you here, today, and I am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it. And while we‚Äôre on the subject of sacrifices, thank God they did not include anyone important from the American delegation, including yours truly,‚Äù she said jokingly, causing the auditorium to laugh. 
She said, ‚ÄúBut all jokes aside, I have to pay homage to the CIA, who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day. Its agents‚Äô work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come. If it hadn‚Äôt been for them, we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations. I am proud that the United States of America has an intelligence agency such as the CIA.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay, a bargain, if you will, when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist. I would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed Gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region. For better of worse, we acted and I am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the CIA out of a deal.

ISIS barbarians used an industrial dough kneader to kill 250 children, and roasted adults in a bakery oven, according to a shocking new report. 
In an interview with the humanitarian organization Roads of Success, Syrian mom Alice Assaf went into chilling detail about the atrocities the jihadists committed about two years ago in the town of Douma, explaining that some of the youngsters were even decapitated in front of their parents, according to the Express. 
‚ÄúWe heard that the militants grabbed six strong men working at the bakery and burned them inside the oven. We knew them,‚Äù Assaf told Dr. Yvette Isaac, who works for the advocacy group, according to the UK Mirror. 
‚ÄúAfter that, they caught some 250 kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine,‚Äù Assaf said, according to media reports. ‚ÄúThey were put in the dough mixer, they were kneaded. The oldest one of them was four-years-old.‚Äù 
ISIS transported hundreds of girls to the city of Douma, which has been at the center of the Syrian civil war, to be slaughtered. ISIS has been systematically killing non-Muslims, and the majority of its victims at the time were Christian. 
Assaf said her own son, George, was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a Muslim name. 
‚ÄúMy son said to me, ‚ÄòNo, mother, I don‚Äôt want to die with an identity not my own. I prefer to die with the name George,'‚Äù Assaf said, according to the Christian Post. 
Assaf added, ‚ÄúI asked my son then to hide, but he refused and said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to hide myself. You are the one who taught me to follow what Christ said‚Äô ‚Äî ‚Äòwhoever denies me before man, I will also deny before my father who is in Heaven.'‚Äù 
Dr. Isaac reported the savage slayings to a member of the UK Parliament, Fiona Bruce, who recently recounted the horrifying testimony to her colleagues in open chambers. 
‚ÄúShe showed us recent film footage of herself talking with mothers‚Äìmore than one‚Äì who had seen their own children crucified,‚Äù Bruce said.

The complaints noted that the machines wrongly identified a voter‚Äôs choice, but in all reported cases, the voters were able to correct their ballots before casting them. 
‚ÄúTo my knowledge, at this point, we don‚Äôt have any cases where elections officials noted significant problems with any machines based on these complaints. Of course they‚Äôre all looked into and that‚Äôs why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official,‚Äù commented Gannon. 
The NC State Board Of Election released the following statement regarding the complaints: 
The N.C. State Board of Elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touch-screen voting machines in several counties. 
Similar reports have been made in recent elections, and we take them very seriously. 
We want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touch-screen machines accurately record voters‚Äô selections. 
Touch-screen machines are tested thoroughly before each election. They are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy. If a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine, they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately. If needed, the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration, and the voter may be moved to a different machine. 
Also, each touch-screen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot. As with paper ballots, voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot. On touch-screen machines, voters also can review a real-time audit log that records all of their selections. 
‚ÄúWe urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots, and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials,‚Äù said Kim Westbrook Strach, executive director of the N.C.

An email published by WikiLeaks on Friday reveals the extent to which Democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends. 
The 2008 email appears shows Democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results. 
‚ÄúFYI: We are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll. Sample too small otherwise,‚Äù operative Tom Matzzie wrote to Clinton adviser Paul Begala, campaign Chairman John Podesta, Media Matters for America founder David Brock, and operative Susan McCue. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Begala responded. 
Trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant Hillary lead over Trump have been manipulated through selective sampling. There is ample evidence that this occurs in Democrat-friendly newsrooms. 
‚ÄúHillary Clinton has opened up a 7-point lead over Donald Trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a ‚Äòbounce‚Äô for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the Democratic nomination last week,‚Äù the Daily Mail reported in June. 
""But the weekly tracking poll, from NBC News and the Surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 percent more self-identified Democrats than Republicans ‚Äì the same margin as the poll's topline result,"" the article noted. 
The email released by WikiLeaks Friday proves that Democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics. 
Polls are a powerful propaganda tool, and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidate's loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on Election Day. 
""I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout,"" Rand Paul said in an interview on Wednesday on ""The Tom Roten Show"" out of West Virginia. ""When we say over and over someone can't win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout,"" he added.";english;2016-10-28T18:22:32.022+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;WikiLeaks: Email Proves Democrats Manipulate Polls;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14776674571.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

Former Illinois congressman and conservative radio host Joe Walsh appeared to invite armed insurrection when he tweeted that he was ""grabbing his musket"" if Hillary Clinton defeats Donald Trump in the presidential election. 
""On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump,"" Walsh tweeted. ""On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket."" 
""@WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean?"" CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted in reply. 
""@jaketapper It means protesting,"" Walsh tweeted. ""Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back."" 
Walsh's rhetoric comes as Americans are already nervous about what will happen on and after Election Day. Trump's insistence that the election is ""rigged,"" and his statement at the last debate that he would keep America ""in suspense"" about whether or not he will accept the results, have left some in fear that violence could flare up if his supporters refuse to accept the outcome. 
More than half of Americans expressed concern about violence on election day according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released Wednesday. 
Walsh dismissed another Twitter user's concern that his call to arms could draw the attention of the Secret Service saying, ""They understand that a musket hasn't been used in battle in almost 200 years."" 
""I'm serious,"" Walsh tweeted later. ""I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right."" 
Walsh repeated his defense that he was only speaking of civil disobedience to NBC's Chicago affiliate. ""We're talking about a musket,"" Walsh said, according to NBC 5 Chicago. ""I could've said grab your slingshot and let's go. Metaphorically, I meant grab your muskets, if Trump loses, man, we're going to do what we have to do. We're going to protest and boycott and practice civil disobedience. We may start a third party.""

The complaints noted that the machines wrongly identified a voter‚Äôs choice, but in all reported cases, the voters were able to correct their ballots before casting them. 
‚ÄúTo my knowledge, at this point, we don‚Äôt have any cases where elections officials noted significant problems with any machines based on these complaints. Of course they‚Äôre all looked into and that‚Äôs why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official,‚Äù commented Gannon. 
The NC State Board Of Election released the following statement regarding the complaints: 
The N.C. State Board of Elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touch-screen voting machines in several counties. 
Similar reports have been made in recent elections, and we take them very seriously. 
We want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touch-screen machines accurately record voters‚Äô selections. 
Touch-screen machines are tested thoroughly before each election. They are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy. If a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine, they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately. If needed, the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration, and the voter may be moved to a different machine. 
Also, each touch-screen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot. As with paper ballots, voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot. On touch-screen machines, voters also can review a real-time audit log that records all of their selections. 
‚ÄúWe urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots, and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials,‚Äù said Kim Westbrook Strach, executive director of the N.C.

An email published by WikiLeaks on Friday reveals the extent to which Democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends. 
The 2008 email appears shows Democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results. 
‚ÄúFYI: We are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll. Sample too small otherwise,‚Äù operative Tom Matzzie wrote to Clinton adviser Paul Begala, campaign Chairman John Podesta, Media Matters for America founder David Brock, and operative Susan McCue. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Begala responded. 
Trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant Hillary lead over Trump have been manipulated through selective sampling. There is ample evidence that this occurs in Democrat-friendly newsrooms. 
‚ÄúHillary Clinton has opened up a 7-point lead over Donald Trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a ‚Äòbounce‚Äô for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the Democratic nomination last week,‚Äù the Daily Mail reported in June. 
""But the weekly tracking poll, from NBC News and the Surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 percent more self-identified Democrats than Republicans ‚Äì the same margin as the poll's topline result,"" the article noted. 
The email released by WikiLeaks Friday proves that Democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics. 
Polls are a powerful propaganda tool, and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidate's loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on Election Day. 
""I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout,"" Rand Paul said in an interview on Wednesday on ""The Tom Roten Show"" out of West Virginia. ""When we say over and over someone can't win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout,"" he added.";english;2016-10-28T18:40:25.518+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;WikiLeaks: Email Proves Democrats Manipulate Polls;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14776674571.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

Former Illinois congressman and conservative radio host Joe Walsh appeared to invite armed insurrection when he tweeted that he was ""grabbing his musket"" if Hillary Clinton defeats Donald Trump in the presidential election. 
""On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump,"" Walsh tweeted. ""On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket."" 
""@WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean?"" CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted in reply. 
""@jaketapper It means protesting,"" Walsh tweeted. ""Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back."" 
Walsh's rhetoric comes as Americans are already nervous about what will happen on and after Election Day. Trump's insistence that the election is ""rigged,"" and his statement at the last debate that he would keep America ""in suspense"" about whether or not he will accept the results, have left some in fear that violence could flare up if his supporters refuse to accept the outcome. 
More than half of Americans expressed concern about violence on election day according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released Wednesday. 
Walsh dismissed another Twitter user's concern that his call to arms could draw the attention of the Secret Service saying, ""They understand that a musket hasn't been used in battle in almost 200 years."" 
""I'm serious,"" Walsh tweeted later. ""I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right."" 
Walsh repeated his defense that he was only speaking of civil disobedience to NBC's Chicago affiliate. ""We're talking about a musket,"" Walsh said, according to NBC 5 Chicago. ""I could've said grab your slingshot and let's go. Metaphorically, I meant grab your muskets, if Trump loses, man, we're going to do what we have to do. We're going to protest and boycott and practice civil disobedience. We may start a third party.""

The excitement over the US election is culminating as the due date is getting closer. Each candidate is trying to use any device at hand to denigrate the other and morality is the last thing to strike the minds of the candidates. The fact of the matter is that morality is a dead circle in the American politics. Hillary Clinton, the democratic candidate, uses f-word in a debate ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/did-hillary-clinton-mutter-donald-trump-debate.html ) watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world and finds no shame in it. Even American religious leaders believe that Clinton is not competent to be the president of a religious country like United States ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/christian-right-leader-hillary-clinton-hostile-biblical-christianity.html ). On the other hand, the GOP candidate, Donald trump , has no better condition. His sexual harassments and violent ideas towards women were shocking not only for female victims, but also for the dominant male group in America. The violent use of words to address different groups of people, mainly in social media ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/as-first-lady-melania-trump-wants-to-save-you-from-her-husband.html ) , made it hard for the parents to allow their kids to follow him. Besides, the number of women that accused Trump of groping and rape ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/list-women-accused-donald-trump-of-sexual-assault.html ) is increasing day by day and the list is running on. The so-called locker-room video of Trump talking dirty about women and his attitude towards them leaked to the public to be the final shot on the republican candidate, but it did not have that much affect. It seems that even grabbing ‚Äúthe women by the p‚Ä¶y‚Äù could not change their idea about Trump. 
All these information, some released by the opponent candidate and some by other sources mainly WikiLeaks, seems to have had little significance in the public orientation in choosing a candidate. This has less to do with the people than with the administration system and media empire in the United States. 
The fact that Trump does not talk about a rigged-election for respecting democracy and exercising the law is clear as a truth. His words that ‚ÄúI will accept the result of the election if I were chosen‚Äù is more like a joke than the words of a would-be president. What Assange is trying to say in his tweet is that the rig is being done on a higher level than the polls or the voting system. The whole administration and political system is rigged in America and the people will not choose a candidate; they are chosen to choose. This is the truth behind the weird public orientation towards election in spite of all the information released about the corruptions of the two candidates in mass media. The fact that the media and the political system are rigging the election in a latent mode is the key to the question raised about the mysteries of the American election.";english;2016-10-29T18:06:17.995+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;"Rigged Primary, Media, and Candidate; the American Rigged System";0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14777533301.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

According to the JASTA law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments‚Äô harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks, it is so likely that Saudi king be tried. According to experts, the passing of JASTA may cause international chaos. Especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute US officials if US do so. 
Is it possible that Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz being tried for potential liability in events of September 11? The trial is possible by the legislation of Jasta. By Jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations. 
In late September, United States Congress ignored President Obama‚Äôs advice and his veto and passed JASTA law, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. This law made US-Saudi relation more chaotic. 
US confederate states expressed concern to JASTA legislation 
Not just Saudi Arabia expressed concerns to JASTA, US confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the US quasi-sacred treaty with Saudi Arabia and asked for appealing. France and the Netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against USA and its military and diplomacy allies. 
John Kerry, United States Secretary of State, showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk. A few days ago Kerry and Adel al-Jubeir discussed about the ramifications of JASTA and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of US interests. He said: ‚Äúthere are ways to fix the problem.‚Äù While experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of America in complaining by circumvent the law. 
Even Saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system. 
According to Hussein ibish, an expert on the Persian Gulf littoral states, JASTA will cause chaos at the international level. 
Last September, European Union warned: ‚ÄúOther countries may also want to pass similar legislation and discuss impunity. This threat was an addition written letters to US government.

The excitement over the US election is culminating as the due date is getting closer. Each candidate is trying to use any device at hand to denigrate the other and morality is the last thing to strike the minds of the candidates. The fact of the matter is that morality is a dead circle in the American politics. Hillary Clinton, the democratic candidate, uses f-word in a debate ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/did-hillary-clinton-mutter-donald-trump-debate.html ) watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world and finds no shame in it. Even American religious leaders believe that Clinton is not competent to be the president of a religious country like United States ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/christian-right-leader-hillary-clinton-hostile-biblical-christianity.html ). On the other hand, the GOP candidate, Donald trump , has no better condition. His sexual harassments and violent ideas towards women were shocking not only for female victims, but also for the dominant male group in America. The violent use of words to address different groups of people, mainly in social media ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/as-first-lady-melania-trump-wants-to-save-you-from-her-husband.html ) , made it hard for the parents to allow their kids to follow him. Besides, the number of women that accused Trump of groping and rape ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/list-women-accused-donald-trump-of-sexual-assault.html ) is increasing day by day and the list is running on. The so-called locker-room video of Trump talking dirty about women and his attitude towards them leaked to the public to be the final shot on the republican candidate, but it did not have that much affect. It seems that even grabbing ‚Äúthe women by the p‚Ä¶y‚Äù could not change their idea about Trump. 
All these information, some released by the opponent candidate and some by other sources mainly WikiLeaks, seems to have had little significance in the public orientation in choosing a candidate. This has less to do with the people than with the administration system and media empire in the United States. 
The fact that Trump does not talk about a rigged-election for respecting democracy and exercising the law is clear as a truth. His words that ‚ÄúI will accept the result of the election if I were chosen‚Äù is more like a joke than the words of a would-be president. What Assange is trying to say in his tweet is that the rig is being done on a higher level than the polls or the voting system. The whole administration and political system is rigged in America and the people will not choose a candidate; they are chosen to choose. This is the truth behind the weird public orientation towards election in spite of all the information released about the corruptions of the two candidates in mass media. The fact that the media and the political system are rigging the election in a latent mode is the key to the question raised about the mysteries of the American election.";english;2016-10-29T19:05:02.999+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;"Rigged Primary, Media, and Candidate; the American Rigged System";0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14777533301.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were stunned a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the ‚Äúfacilitation/abetment‚Äù of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM)‚Äîand for reasons yet to be firmly established. 
According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their ‚Äúbank of banks‚Äù; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest ‚Äúmegabank‚Äù; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia. 
With Hillary Clinton‚Äôs US presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta having longstanding ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associates‚Äîincluding both Hillary Clinton and her husband, and former US President, Bill Clinton. 
On Saturday 15 October (2016), this report notes, the SVR reported to the MoF that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta met with JP Morgan Chase & Company CEO Jamie Dimon at Clinton‚Äôs Chappaqua Compound outside of New York City‚Äîand who, in 2009, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton allowed to break US laws by his, Dimon‚Äôs, being able to buy millions-of-dollars of his company‚Äôs stocks prior to the public being told his JP Morgan bank was receiving a Federal Reserve $80 billion credit line‚Äîand that caused JP Morgan‚Äôs stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920% dividend growth since 2010. 
Within 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton-John Podesta-Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound, this report continues, the BIS registered the transfer of $1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank. 
To why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar, this report explains, is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo-patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who oversaw the ‚Äúmassive bribery scheme‚Äù that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup‚Äîand that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, and incredibly, in 2011, gave former US President Bill Clinton $1 million for a birthday present‚Äîbringing Hillary Clinton‚Äôs total ‚Äúcash grab‚Äù from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $100 million‚Äîall occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton‚Äôs knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were, and still are, funding ISIS. 
To what Jamie Dimon said to Hillary Clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer $1.8 billion to Qatar, this report notes, revolves around his JP Morgan bank being told by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in April (2016) that this ‚Äúmegabanks‚Äù master plan to save itself had ‚Äúserious deficiencies‚Äù that could ‚Äúpose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States‚Äù. 
Two months after the FDIC‚Äôs warning letter to Jamie Dimon, in June (2016), this report says, he cryptically ‚Äúsounded a warning‚Äù that the United States sub-prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that ‚Äúsomeone is going to get hurt‚Äù. 
Unbeknownst to the American people, MoF experts in this report explain, is that just 8 weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the United States $1 trillion sub-prime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapse‚Äîand that this past week became so severe the Bank of America issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that ‚Äúthis market is scary‚Äù, and the British-based multinational banking and financial services company HSBC, likewise, issued a ‚ÄúRed Alert‚Äù warning all of its clients warning them to ‚Äúprepare for a severe market crash‚Äù. 
With one of the first casualties of this sub-prime auto loan bubble being the German global banking giant Deutsche Bank that is ‚Äúnearing its doom‚Äù and laying off tens-of-thousands of it workers worldwide, this report grimly states, the American mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophe‚Äîwho unlike Hillary Clinton who has just protected $1.8 billion of her wealth, will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers. 
As Wikileaks secret Hillary Clinton emails have now proven that the US propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her, and who continue their blackout on the ‚ÄúClinton Crime Story of the Century‚Äù, this report continues, the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding 35% of American who have been brutalized by the Obama-Clinton regime these past 8 years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is, likewise, being kept from these most innocent of peoples.";english;2016-10-29T20:49:42.827+03:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚ÄúSudden Move‚Äù Of $1.8 Billion To Qatar Central Bank Stuns Financial World;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14777572901.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

Queen Elizabeth II is not like you and me. 
Did you know she is immune from prosecution? That she has her own personal poet, paid in Sherry wine? Or that she holds dominion over British swans and can fire the entire Australian government? 
It's true that her role as the British head of state is largely ceremonial, and the Monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day. The historic ""prerogative powers"" of the Sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers. But this still means that when the British government declares war, or regulates the civil service, or signs a treaty, it is doing so only on her authority. 
And she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself ‚Äî as well as numerous other unique powers, ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre. 
Most famously, she owns all swans in the River Thames. 
Technically, all unmarked swans in open water belong to the Queen, though the Crown ""exercises her ownership"" only ""on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries,"" according to the official website of the Royal Family. 
Today this tradition is observed during the annual ""Swan Upping,"" in which swans in the River Thames are caught, ringed, and set free again as part of census of the swan population. 
It's a highly ceremonial affair, taking place over five days. ""Swan uppers"" wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the Queen's Swan Marker. 
""The swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by The Queen's Swan Warden, a Professor of Ornithology at the University of Oxford's Department of Zoology,"" according to the Royal Family website. 
""Rule, Britannia, Britannia rules the waves,"" goes a classic British song ‚Äî and this rule extends beneath the waves, too. The sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in British waters. 
The Queen still technically owns all the sturgeons, whales, and dolphins in the waters around England and Wales, in a rule that dates back to a statute from 1324, during the reign of King Edward II, according to Time. 
According to the article: ""This statute is still valid today, and sturgeons, porpoises, whales, and dolphins are recognised as 'fishes royal': when they are captured within 3 miles (about 5 km) of UK shores or wash ashore, they may be claimed on behalf of the Crown. Generally, when brought into port, a sturgeon is sold in the usual way, and the purchaser, as a gesture of loyalty, requests the honour of its being accepted by Elizabeth."" 
The law is still observed: In 2004, a Welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a 10-foot sturgeon, the BBC reported at the time. The Scottish government also issued guidance on the law in 2007, writing that ""the right to claim Royal Fish in Scotland allows the Scottish Government (on behalf of the Crown) to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a 'wain pulled by six oxen.'"" 
The Queen can drive without a licence. 
Driving licenses are issued in the Queen's name, yet she is the only person in the United Kingdom who doesn't legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars, according to Time. 
Despite not being required to have a license, the Queen is comfortable behind the wheel, having learned to drive during World War II when she operated a first-aid truck for the Women's Auxillary Territorial Service. (As a result of the Queen's training, she can also change a spark plug, Time notes). 
Queen Elizabeth II isn't afraid to show off her driving skills, either. In 1998, she surprised King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia (then still a prince) by driving him around in her country seat of Balmoral. 
Former British Ambassador Sherard Cowper-Coles recounted the meeting in the Sunday Times: ""As instructed, the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front Land Rover, with his interpreter in the seat behind. To his surprise, the Queen climbed into the driving seat, turned the ignition and drove off. Women are not ‚Äî yet ‚Äî allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia, and Abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman, let alone a queen."" 
Cowper-Coles continued: ""His nervousness only increased as the Queen, an army driver in wartime, accelerated the Land Rover along the narrow Scottish estate roads, talking all the time. Through his interpreter, the crown prince implored the Queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead."" 
Unlike other members of the Royal family, the Queen does not require a passport, as they are issued in her name. Despite this lack of travel documents, she has been abroad many times. 
She has two birthdays. 
When you're the British head of state, one birthday just isn't enough. The Queen's official birthday is celebrated on a Saturday in June, though her actual birthday is on April 21. 
""Official celebrations to mark a sovereign's birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday, particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer,"" according to the Royal Mint. 
Both birthdays are celebrated in suitable style, too. Her actual birthday ""is marked publicly by gun salutes in central London at midday,"" according to the official website of the British Monarchy. This includes ""a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park, a 21-gun salute in Windsor Great Park, and a 62-gun salute at the Tower of London. In 2006, Her Majesty celebrated her 80th Birthday in 2006 with a walkabout in the streets outside of Windsor Castle to meet well-wishers."" 
For her ""official"" birthday celebrations, meanwhile, she ""is joined by other members of the Royal Family at the spectacular Trooping the Colour parade, which moves between Buckingham Palace, The Mall, and Horseguards' Parade."" 
She has her own private cash machine. 
Less a ""power"" and more a perk of the job, a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of Buckingham Palace. It's provided by Coutts, one of Britain's most prestigious ‚Äî and exclusive ‚Äî banks. 
The Queen has her own personal poet. 
The poet laureate is an honorary position in British society appointed by the Monarch to a poet ""whose work is of national significance,"" according to the official website of the British Monarchy. When first the role was introduced, the appointee was paid ¬£200 per year plus a butt of canary wine. Today the poet laureate is given a barrel of Sherry. 
Carol Ann Duffy will hold the position until 2019. 
She has to sign laws. 
The Queen's consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law. Once a proposed law has passed both houses of Parliament, it makes its way to the Palace for approval, which is called ""Royal Assent."" The most recent British Monarch to refuse to provide Royal Assent was Queen Anne, back in 1708. 
Royal Assent is different than ""Queen's consent,"" in which the Queen must consent to any law being debated in Parliament that affects the Monarchy's interests (such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the Duchy of Cornwall, for example). Without consent, the bill cannot be debated in Parliament. 
Queen's consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers, but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition. 
It has been exercised at least 39 times, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information act, including ""one instance [in which] the Queen completely vetoed the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill in 1999, a private member's bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the monarch to parliament,"" The Guardian reported in 2013. 
She can create Lords. 
The Queen has the power to appoint Lords, who can then sit in Parliament, the upper house in Britain's legislative system. Like many other powers, this is exercised only ""on the advice of"" elected government ministers. 
She doesn't have to pay tax (but she does anyway). 
The Queen does not have to pay tax, but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since 1992. 
The Queen has the power to form governments. 
Unlike the Queen, Prime Minister David Cameron doesn't literally sit on a throne. Rob Stothard/Getty Images/HBO/BI 
The Queen previously wielded the power to dissolve Parliament and call a general election, but the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act put an end to that in 2011. Now a two-thirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve Parliament before a five-year fixed-term is up. 
She does still play a part after an election, however, when she calls on the MP most able to form a government to do so. 
This caused some worry ahead of this year's General Election. It once looked as if the Conservatives might not have a majority (but would be the largest party) and would try to form a government. Meanwhile, it was feasible that Labour could form a majority, despite having fewer seats, by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties. 
In this situation, the Queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place. Every year, she opens Parliament with the Queen's speech, which lays out the government's plans. But to give David Cameron's speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government ‚Äî while staying away would send the opposite message. 
At one point, The Times was told by sources that she planned to ""stay away"" if Cameron failed to secure enough MPs, but the Palace later had an about-face. ""Royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings, even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the Tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties,"" The Times subsequently reported. 
She has knights.‚Äã 
Sure, they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour, but Britain still retains knights. Like Lords, they are appointed by the Queen ‚Äî and she knights them personally. 
Knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to British society ‚Äî whether in business, the arts, the military, or elsewhere. After Terry Pratchett was knighted, the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite. 
The individuals knighted are decided by ministers, the BBC reports, ""who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval."" 
She is exempt from Freedom Of Information requests. 
All information about the royal family is exempt from Freedom of Information requests. The exemption was made after a legal battle between The Guardian and the government to have letters from Prince Charles sent to Whitehall ministers made public. The so-called black spider memos were recently released, but the change means the same can't happen in the future. 
She can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in ""grave constitutional crisis."" 
While the overwhelming majority of the Queen's prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers, there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself. Only ""in grave constitutional crisis,"" the Sovereign can ""act contrary to or without Ministerial advice."" With no precedent in modern times, it's not clear what would actually constitute this, but the possibility remains. 
The Queen holds the ability to fire the entire Australian government. 
As the head of state in Australia, the Queen has certain powers over the government. In 1975, for example, the Queen's representative in the country at the time, Gov. Gen. Sir John Kerr, fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown. 
""[Kerr] appointed a replacement, who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government, Max Fisher wrote in The Washington Post. ""Three hours later, Kerr dismissed the rest of Parliament. Then Australia held elections to restart from scratch. And they haven't had another shutdown since."" 
In addition to the UK and Australia, the Queen is also the head of state in Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. 
All the above are Commonwealth Realms, or former British colonies. The British sovereign retains the position she holds in the United Kingdom, that of head of state. As in Britain, this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day. 
She's the head of a religion. 
Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Church of England, Britain's state religion first established after King Henry VIII split away from the Catholic Church in Rome in the 16th century. 
Her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the Church of England, and she also has the power to appoint Bishops and Archbishops. As with many of her other powers, however, this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister, who himself takes advice from a Church Commission. 
An interesting side effect of this is that the Sovereign must be a confirmed member of Church of England. Catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the British throne. If Prince Charles converted to Islam, for example, he would be unable to become king after Queen Elizabeth II dies. 
She gets to give away special money to the elderly. 
Maundy money is a special kind of silver coin the Queen gives away to pensioners every year at a UK cathedral every Easter in a special ceremony. The number of recipients corresponds with the Sovereign's age. This year, for example, she will be 89 when Easter rolls around, so she will give maundy money away to 89 pensioners. 
The coins are technically legal tender, despite coming in unconventional 3-pence and 4-pence denominations. But given the coins' rare status, they tend not to enter general circulation. 
She's also immune from prosecution. 
All prosecutions are carried out in the name of the Sovereign, and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court. 
In theory, the Sovereign ""is incapable of thinking or doing wrong,"" legal scholar John Kirkhope told Business Insider. However, barrister Baroness Helena Kennedy QC told the BBC in 2002 that ""nowadays, that immunity is questionable."" 
""Although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the Sovereign as a person under UK law, the Queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law,"" according to official site of the Monarchy. 
If the monarch did commit a grievance offence, he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate. There is at least one precedent of the Courts' prosecuting the Sovereign. In the 17th Century, King Charles I was tried for treason following the English Civil War. He said ""no earthly power can justly call me (who am your King) in question as a delinquent."" The Court disagreed and had him executed. 
The Queen has the right to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn her ministers. 
Assuming no ""grave constitutional crisis,"" the Queen's input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right ""to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn"" her ministers ‚Äî advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister. 
The Queen also has certain historic rights and privileges. John Kirkhope, a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of ""Queen's consent"" made public, provided Business Insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the Queen still holds. 
Hungerford has to present a red rose to the Sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rights.The Duke of Atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the Sovereign calls. This most recently happened during the reign of Queen Victoria, so it's unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colour.If the Sovereign passes near Kidwelly Castle in Wales, the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour. This is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruin.The Marquis of Ailesbury owns Savernake Forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the Sovereign pass through the Forest. This last happened in 1943.Similarly, the owner of Dunlambert Castle in Northern Ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugle.And lastly, many landowners must also pay a ""quit-rent"" ‚Äî a kind of tax on their property paid to the Monarch. Some are pretty unusual. 
The owner of Sauchlemuir Castle must set out three glasses of port on New Year's Eve for the grandmother of James IV of Scotland. (For reference, James IV served from 1474 to 1513.)The owner of Fowlis must deliver ‚Äî when required ‚Äî a snowball in mid-summer.The City of Gloucester pays for its holdings of Crown Lands by providing an enormous eel pie.Great Yarmouth must provide a hundred herrings baked in 24 pasties to the Sheriff, who then sends them to the Lord of the Manor ‚Äî who then sends them to the Sovereign.The Duke of Marlborough has to present a small satin flag with a Fleur de Lys on August 13, the anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim.The Duke of Wellington has to present a French Tricolour flag before noon on June 19 ‚Äî the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.";english;2016-10-30T14:19:34.955+02:00;awdnews.com;DE;;Queen Elizabeth II owns every dolphin in Britain and doesn't need a driving licence and doesn't pay tax ‚Äî here are the incredible powers you didn't know the monarchy has;0.0;http://awdnews.com/images/14778275732701-bj74t1.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;conspiracy

He‚Äôs 4-foot-9, has brown hair, and is wearing a shirt with a lizard on it. These robot street performers have not been any help at all. 1. The weather was nice, so I took my son to the boardwalk to walk around and watch the street performers. We were in line to get pretzels when he ran off to chase after a pigeon, and I lost him in the crowd. I looked around the area and couldn‚Äôt find him anywhere. So I ran up to one of those robot street-performer guys that I know my son loves to watch and asked him if he had seen a small boy with a lizard shirt on. The guy turned to me and just started robotically dancing to ‚ÄúFunkytown.‚Äù No matter how much I implored him to stop dancing to ‚ÄúFunkytown‚Äù and tell me if he‚Äôd seen my son, he refused to break character for even a goddamn second. This was extremely upsetting to me, but I didn‚Äôt have time to dwell on it. I ran off in search of my son. 2. The next robot street performer I asked about my son was doing the thing where they pretend to be in ‚Äúoff mode‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt even look me in the eye as I begged him to help me find my little boy. But I was really starting to worry about my son, so I played along and threw a dollar in his tip bucket hoping that would make him ‚Äúturn on.‚Äù But that didn‚Äôt make him turn on. So I threw $5 in his bucket, and that didn‚Äôt make him turn on either. Finally, I put a $20 in the bucket, and he whirred to life, blowing on his weird, whirling whistle thing. But he still wouldn‚Äôt tell me if he had seen my son. He just kept blowing on that stupid fucking whistle of his. That‚Äôs all he did. Whistle and whistle and whistle. 3. At this point it had been 10 minutes or so since I lost track of my son, so I was officially in panic mode. I went up to yet another one of the boardwalk‚Äôs many robot street performers and asked him if he had seen my son. I even took out a picture of him to show the guy. He looked at the picture and studied it for a moment, and I‚Äôm elated because, unlike the other ones, he actually seemed like he might help me. But then he took the picture of my son, put it in his mouth, and pretended to robotically print it out of his mouth like a ticket or something. So I grabbed the picture and started to walk away when the son of a bitch took me by the hand and offered me a metallic rose. This piece of shit was incorporating me into his whole goddamn act. And by the way, the crowd was loving it. They were eating it up. So I threw his stupid metallic rose on the ground and asked him again if he‚Äôd seen my son. And he just started doing a robotic version of the beating-heart thing that mimes do. By then I was just crying because I was so worried about my son, and the motherfucker offered me a metallic handkerchief. A metallic fucking handkerchief. I swear to God. 4. When I went up to this robot street performer, he was smoking a cigarette and looking at his phone, clearly on a break. Finally, I thought. This man will help me find my son. But when I asked him if he had seen my boy, he actually went back into character and started smoking his cigarette all robotically. What a nightmare. 5. I really could‚Äôve used some comfort and assistance when I approached this robot street performer and asked him if he had seen my son. Instead, I got a dance battle between him, one of those tree guys, and a couple of statue men. All of them refused to acknowledge me, including the statue men who honestly shouldn‚Äôt have even been dancing because their whole thing is supposed to be that they‚Äôre statues. But they did dance. And they were really good. The whole group was really good at dancing. And they wouldn‚Äôt stop for a second to help a distraught mother find her child. Disgusting. 6. As soon as I asked this robot performer if he had seen my son anywhere, he pointed his robot finger at a little boy in the front row. I told him that was not my son and described him to the guy. The guy then pointed at the boy again. Again, I told him this was not my child. He then started robot dancing around the boy, pointing to him over and over and over again. The boy was loving the attention, but I was infuriated. Fed up with the robot street performers, I turned to the little boy and asked him if he had seen a little boy about his age running around here on his own. The little boy looked up at me, considering the question. Then one of these robot street-performer fucking shitwads showed up with a boombox blasting ‚ÄúFunkytown,‚Äù and suddenly everyone was dancing to ‚ÄúFunkytown,‚Äù including this little boy. That‚Äôs when I gave up hope of finding out if any of the robot street performers had seen my son. Daniel, if you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôm by the bike rental.

Whether or not you‚Äôre a basketball fan, you‚Äôre going to love this story about a bold new humanitarian initiative from the NBA. In order to help alleviate the refugee crisis in Europe, the league is housing Syrian refugees on whichever half of the court isn‚Äôt being played on during the game. 
Now that‚Äôs making a difference. Way to go, NBA! 
Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, millions of Syrians have been displaced. But thanks to the generosity of the NBA, some of them will now find a new home right around the three-point line on the half of the court that isn‚Äôt being played on at that time. While players occupy one half of the court, Syrian refugees will have a safe and welcoming space on the other half to reassemble their lives until the ball changes possession and they are shuttled to the opposite end. 
Wow. What a beautiful gesture from the NBA! With 29 courts across the country and 82 games in the 2016-2017 season, the league is set to provide housing that periodically oscillates from one half of the court to the other for several thousand Syrian refugees. This is huge. 
In contrast to Europe‚Äôs notoriously overcrowded refugee camps, the NBA‚Äôs half courts are big enough to comfortably house at least five families around the perimeter and one or two in the paint. The refugees also have access to any snack vendors who happen to be milling about the crowd near whichever half of the court they‚Äôre on at the time. 
Of course, it‚Äôs a new program, and it‚Äôs not perfect. There have been several incidents in which refugees have collided with players after failing to get to the other half of the court in time, and last night an 8-year-old Syrian girl had to be treated for minor injuries after LeBron James dunked on her during a fast break. 
Still, according to NBA commissioner Adam Silver, the program is a huge step up from the refugee camps abroad. 
‚ÄúThe Syrian refugee crisis is only getting worse. Meanwhile, we‚Äôve got this half of the court that isn‚Äôt being played on just collecting dust waiting to be put to good use,‚Äù said Silver, adding that he felt the league had a moral responsibility to harbor the refugees. ‚ÄúIf we can help these people by sheltering them on one side of the court until there‚Äôs a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half as soon as there‚Äôs a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half until there‚Äôs a change in possession, then we have an obligation to do that.‚Äù 
It‚Äôs refreshing to see a major organization like the NBA reaching out to a group of people who so desperately need our help right now.

In an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds, it‚Äôs often difficult to separate fact from fiction. That was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of President Obama began to circulate online, with many insisting that the image was the real, unedited deal. But today that picture was officially debunked: The photo of Obama with a speech balloon saying ‚ÄúIslam is my main thing‚Äù has been proven to be doctored. 
Wow. This is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt! 
Take a look at the photo in question above. In it, you can clearly see Obama proudly declaring his unshakeable Islamic faith. 
At first glance, the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that Obama may be Muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most far-right critics, who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs. But when the image went viral on Twitter, one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring: 
Many users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in. A graphic designer named Brendan McCann, whose Twitter bio says he‚Äôs been in the industry for over a decade, quickly answered the call. 
But it was Snopes that officially put the matter to rest. After scouring the internet far and wide, they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph, taken during one of the president‚Äôs official White House photo ops, and there‚Äôs no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the Quran anywhere in sight. 
Take a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved: 
Well, there you have it. It looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the president‚Äôs head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top. It‚Äôs a powerful effect, but it‚Äôs definitely not real. Remember: When it comes to the internet, always question your sources!

1. Prior to the trip, forget what birds are: When you‚Äôre tripping, you‚Äôll eventually learn about birds, and it‚Äôll blow your fuckin‚Äô mind. 
2. Surround yourself with lots of sharp knives and guns: You‚Äôll want to be able to fight off any terrifying creatures that might suddenly appear before you. 
3. Set your alarm to go off every six seconds to remind you to breathe: Remember, safety first. It may seem ‚Äúdorky,‚Äù but setting a breath alarm can save your life. 
4. Write the words ‚ÄúGOOD TIME‚Äù on your forehead: That way, if you‚Äôre feeling depressed at any point while tripping, you can just look in the mirror and be reminded of the type of time that you‚Äôre supposed to be having! 
5. Politely ask any terminally ill loved ones to hold off on dying until after your trip: They will understand that you want your experience to be mind-opening, not sad.

7.

I was already deeply embarrassed, and these new iPhone emojis are just salt in the wound. 1. My Car Falling Into The Pool 
The swimming pool near my house closes after the summer, so I decided to have one last splash in late September. It was a little cold to go swimming, but I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on the fun of the pool. Despite the chilly weather, I had a great experience, at least until it was time to head to my car and drive home. Leaving the parking space, I accidentally went backwards and drove my Honda right through a chain-link fence and into the pool. I can‚Äôt excuse this dumb mistake, but in my defense I was still soaking wet and shivering, and that distracted me from driving. When Apple released this emoji of my car going into the pool, I was mostly curious why they had singled my situation out for an update, but I have to admit I kind of deserved it. 2. Me In My Flooding Car 
I have always been a loyal customer of Apple‚Äôs technology products, which makes this second emoji feel like a betrayal. The first emoji of my car falling into the pool was perhaps deserved, because I was extremely clumsy and foolish, but a second emoji at my expense was completely uncalled-for. Worst of all, this emoji has now been embraced by teens to represent bad sex, and they tweet messages like ‚Äúmy Tinder date went well but [EMOJI] FML.‚Äù I am uncomfortable having my face seen by millions of people in this context. 3. The Lifeguard Calling Me A Dunce 
I am furious with this emoji because it is inaccurate as well as cruel. Unlike Apple, the lifeguard was nothing but polite as he helped me crawl out of my underwater car‚Äôs window, and at no point did he call me a dunce. The lifeguard did ask, ‚ÄúWhat the hell happened?‚Äù and I could tell he thought I was dumb, but he did not say the word ‚Äúdunce‚Äù or any other insult. Not even once. If Apple wants to taunt me with their emojis, they can at least depict things as they actually occurred. 4. The Words ‚ÄúWet Idiot‚Äù Beneath Me As I Swim Out Of The Pool 
Doesn‚Äôt Apple know I already feel bad enough about swimming across a pool in my street clothes? All the other swimmers had already evacuated the pool and were watching me with judgmental eyes as I flailed through the water in jeans and a polo T-shirt. My sneakers got completely soaked and still smell mildewy weeks after drying out. This humiliation is only mitigated by the fact that the wet-idiot emoji is now extremely popular among iPhone users in China, and millions of Chinese people use it in text messages to represent amazing sex. But still, I wish Apple had elected not to release any of these. 5. Me On The Bicycle I Must Ride Now That My Car Is Ruined 
Under normal circumstances, I would be thrilled and honored to have Apple turn my bicycle into an emoji. However, given the timing, it seems like Apple is poking fun at the fact that now this bicycle is my only mode of transportation. Perhaps losing a car to a swimming pool isn‚Äôt a big deal to a rich company like Apple, but to normal folks like me, a Honda is a major investment and I cannot afford to replace it at this time. What stings worst of all is that I find this emoji very handy, and I frequently text it to people to tell them I‚Äôm on my way. Unfortunately, despite Apple‚Äôs cruel mission to shame me, I find my iPhone too useful to stop using.";english;2016-10-28T07:36:37.979+03:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Life: 5 New Emojis Apple Created Specifically To Shame Me For The Time I Backed My Car Into The Public Swimming Pool;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3430/1/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

With Election Day fast approaching, citizens everywhere are bracing themselves for an uncertain future. Fortunately, no matter what happens, there‚Äôs at least one truth that voters from both sides can hang their hats on: Political scientists have confirmed that the outcome of the presidential election will in no way affect ketchup. 
Whew! What a tremendous relief! 
Trump or Clinton, whoever takes the office in November, ketchup will still be red, salty, and sweet, according to leading experts. Despite a range of conflicting policies listed on the candidates‚Äô websites, they are in full agreement about ketchup, a substance neither candidate plans to change in any way. Americans can be certain that a vote cast on November 8 is a vote that in no way alters the familiar appearance, flavor, or viscosity of ketchup. 
Ketchup fans rejoice! 
Whether 2017 marks the beginning of higher taxes for high-income households per Clinton‚Äôs plan or tax cuts across all income brackets per Trump‚Äôs, ketchup will remain exactly the same condiment it‚Äôs always been. Regardless of how the next four years change U.S. immigration policy, and no matter whether they see the passage of the DREAM Act or the construction of a border wall, ketchup will abide by the same recipe and will be available in the same variety of packaging. 
If you had any doubts about the future of ketchup, it looks like you can breathe easy. No doubt, the outcome of one of the most divisive elections in history will bring about certain changes, but there will be none for ketchup.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù says your sister. ‚ÄúIf I have your story right, you hailed a cab in the forest, and at some point the driver got out of the vehicle, and that‚Äôs all you remember.‚Äù Exactly. There's more to the story. Let me start over. 
‚ÄúThe next thing I knew, he was back in the cab. 
‚ÄòWhere you headed?‚Äô he asked me again.‚Äù I told him to go to my sister's house. He got out of the cab again. 
‚ÄúI believe you about the driver getting out of the car, but I don‚Äôt think you saw any aliens,‚Äù says your sister. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs just how I feel.‚Äù 
Your sister doesn‚Äôt believe that you were abducted by aliens. You have failed. Start Over 
‚ÄúThe cabbie floored it, and pretty soon we were driving through the city on the way to my sister‚Äôs house, which is where you live.‚Äù We arrived, and I thanked the cabbie for his service. 
‚ÄúWhen we arrived, I got out of the cab. The cabbie and I pointed at each other and waved goodbye in silence for three minutes.‚Äù And that's the end of my story. 
‚ÄúWell, it certainly sounds like you took a taxi from the forest to my apartment, but I‚Äôm sorry to say I‚Äôm not convinced that you saw any aliens,‚Äù says your sister. ‚ÄúIs that really the whole story?‚Äù Yes, that's it. There was more. 
‚ÄúThen I don‚Äôt believe you saw any aliens.‚Äù 
Ouch. You really bungled the story about how you were abducted by aliens. You are a miserable bard of the supernatural, and your sister didn‚Äôt believe you at all. You have failed. Start Over 
Your sister settles in as you begin your alien testimony‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúIt began like any other night. I thought it was Guy Fawkes Night, so I was in the forest setting off fireworks by myself.‚Äù I would light the firework, run back to safety, look up, and‚Ä¶ 
‚Äú Boom! Good riddance, Sir Fawkes!‚Äù It was so much fun, I decided to light another firework. I wasn't having fun, but I decided to light another firework. 
‚ÄúI lit the firework, stepped back, and looked up. I expected to see a sparkling skyrocket. What I saw was‚Ä¶‚Äù A sparkling skyrocket, just as I had expected. A strange light in the sky. 
‚ÄúYes, it was a skyrocket. My expectation was on the money. 
I prepared to launch another firework into the sky. I loaded it up, sprinted back to safety, and looked to the sky again, this time expecting to see the gorgeous blue and purple firework known as the Butcher‚Äôs Delight‚Ä¶‚Äù And the Butcher's Delight it was. And that's when it happened. 
‚ÄúI was right again. In the clear sky above me, I saw the firework called the Butcher‚Äôs Delight. 
I set up the last firework, drew a match, and lit the fuse. It was a quick fuse, so the firework had already launched by the time I turned around and looked up, thinking I would see the unmistakeable multicolored burst of the Salute to James Buchanan firework. But is that what I saw, looking to the skies?‚Äù Yes, it was. It was not, for that was when it happened. 
‚ÄúYes, my sibling. The Salute to James Buchanan firework exploded as planned. 
I applauded at the fireworks finale, congratulating myself on another successful night of fireworks even as I realized that I had bungled the Guy Fawkes date again.‚Äù Then I went home. Then I came right to you. 
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù says your sister. ‚ÄùThat was a very nice story about how you set off fireworks in the woods by yourself. And did you see any aliens while you were at it?‚Äù Yes. No. 
‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt believe you. You only told me about fireworks. I was expecting to hear more about aliens.‚Äù 
You have not convinced your sister that you saw aliens. Wait, I didn't tell it right. Start Over 
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù says your sister. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too bad nothing happened with aliens.‚Äù 
You have not convinced her that you were abducted by aliens. Wait, I didn't tell it right. Start Over 
‚ÄúA strange light appeared in the sky.‚Äù I ran, but the strange light followed me. I couldn't escape it. There was a sudden burst of futuristic light. 
‚ÄúScience enveloped me.‚Äù The light only got more futuristic. Then all of a sudden, I was standing on the UFO deck. 
‚ÄúWhen the light faded, I noticed that I was on a spaceship. 
This part of the ship was clean and triangular.‚Äù I noticed that the spaceship had some sort of artificial gravity. I could tell immediately that the spaceship was in space. 
‚ÄúOkay, I think I understand that you were on a spaceship,‚Äù says your sister. ‚ÄúGet to the aliens, though. How about some aliens in the story? When you were on the spaceship, were there any aliens that you saw?‚Äù Yes. I don't know, but my boss from my first job was there. 
‚ÄúMy boss from my first job was there, and he was happy to see me.‚Äù My boss said that I was dreaming, and I said ‚ÄúYes, that seems right.‚Äù My boss said that I was dreaming, and I said, ""No, that's wrong,"" but it later turned out that he was right. 
‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù says your sister. ‚ÄúIt sounds to me like instead of encountering aliens, you had a dream about seeing your boss in space. Could that be right?‚Äù Yeah, that's definitely right. Wait, I told the story wrong. Let me start over. 
You were trying to get your sister to believe that you had seen aliens, but all you managed to convince her of was that you had a dream about seeing your boss in space. You failed! Start Over 
‚ÄúThere were aliens. A crowd of them. Huge, mighty creatures with skin like leather, hollow black eyes, and fearsome ivory fangs.‚Äù The aliens were shouting at me, but I couldn't understand what they were saying. ""JENCH CREV AMAMU!"" the aliens shouted, but I could not understand. 
‚ÄúFrom among the aliens, a bigger alien stepped forth. I immediately realized this was their mayor of the aliens, as the alien was wearing a ceremonial mayoral jacket.‚Äù The mayor took out a device. 
‚ÄúThe mayor reached out and put the device over my eyes. 
Suddenly, I could hear everything differently.‚Äù The mayor then seemed to speak to me in English. 
‚Äú‚ÄòWelcome to my UFO,‚Äô said the mayor. ‚ÄòYou are now wearing language glasses. They allow you to understand anything that we say in our language, but be careful: It doesn‚Äôt work the other way around. If you want to learn how to talk like us, you‚Äôll need to visit the Language Room and earn a diploma from the language guide.‚Äô‚Äù I told the mayor that I understood. I told the mayor that I didn't understand. I asked the mayor to explain who the aliens were and what their purpose was. 
‚Äú‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre saying, but I‚Äôm going to assume you asked who we are and what our purpose is. 
‚ÄòTo do that, I will need to tell you how the world works. In the universe, there are three kinds of things. First, there is us. We are called people. You can tell we‚Äôre people by inspecting our beautiful ivory fangs and big, thick legs. It‚Äôs obvious. 
‚ÄòSecond, there is God. God is special, secret, and far away, and there is only one of him. And we need to find him so that we can hold hands forever. We don‚Äôt know where God is, but we are looking for him. 
‚ÄòLast, there is rocks. Rocks is everything else. Planets are rocks. Spaceships are rocks. Since you are not a person, you are probably also a rock‚Ä¶unless of course you are God. But that‚Äôs very unlikely and illegal.‚Äô‚Äù I asked the mayor how to find out if I am a rock or if I am God. 
‚Äú‚ÄòI still can‚Äôt understand you, but here‚Äôs the deal. I‚Äôm going to retreat to the observation deck and look at the majesty of space for a while. Go to the Language Room, learn our language, then come find me and we‚Äôll see if we can find a use for you.‚Äô‚Äù The mayor left, and I was alone with the crowd of aliens. 
‚ÄúIn the spaceship‚Äôs deck, the crowd of aliens was talking excitedly about God and about the kinds of dances they would do together when they found him at last.‚Äù I left the deck area and went south into the hallway. 
‚ÄúIn the Language Room, a man was standing on a small, circular stage. 
Above him hung a giant banner that read ‚ÄòLANGUAGE TUTORIAL FOR ENGLISH SPEAKERS.‚Äô‚Äù He began the tutorial. 
‚Äú‚ÄòWelcome to this free alien-language tutorial for English speakers!‚Äô said the man. ‚ÄòIf you are viewing this in hologram form, it means our captors have determined I am no longer necessary, and that they have mercifully killed me and freed me from my didactic prison. Right on!‚Äô‚Äù I waved my hand through him to confirm that he was a hologram. I continued watching the presentation. 
‚ÄúHe was not a hologram. 
‚ÄòHa! Not yet! I wish!‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòPlease sit down, and let‚Äôs get this presentation over with!‚Äô‚Äù I sat back down and kept watching the presentation. 
‚Äú‚ÄòLet‚Äôs begin with the most basic grammatical element of the language: the word CREV,‚Äô the man began. 
He gestured in the air beside him, where the word CREV appeared in red light. 
‚ÄòCREV is a verb that roughly translates as ‚Äúto be about to point at something.‚Äù If you want to communicate effectively with the aliens, it‚Äôs an extremely important word to know.‚Äô‚Äù ""CREV,"" I managed to say. ""CREB,"" I blurted stupidly. 
‚Äú‚ÄòFor example, to announce that I am ready to point at something, I would begin with the word AMAMU, which means ‚Äúme,‚Äù then I would say, ‚ÄúCREV,‚Äù then I would say what I am pointing at.‚Äô 
‚ÄòLike this: AMAMU CREV MERYL STREEP.‚Äô‚Äù I looked where the man was pointing. I knew then that the man was pointing at Meryl Streep. 
‚Äú‚ÄòHello!‚Äô said Meryl Streep. ‚ÄòI am definitely a hologram.‚Äô‚Äù ""AMAMU CREV MERYL STREEP,"" I said as I pointed at the Meryl Streep hologram. 
‚Äú‚ÄòVery good. The next word we‚Äôre going to learn is important, but be aware that it is very politically charged. I am of course talking about the controversial word CREVV, and you must be very careful with it. It‚Äôs a slur that means ‚Äúbad alien‚Äù and is extremely insulting to use in any situation but language tutorials.‚Äô‚Äù ""CREVV,"" I said. I nodded solemnly. I asked the teacher for an example of the bad word in context. 
‚Äú‚ÄòHere is an example of CREVV used in English context: Oh God. The aliens are killing me. Why did I say CREVV? Why didn‚Äôt someone teach me not to say CREVV? I shouldn‚Äôt have said CREVV.‚Äô‚Äù I said, ""Okay."" I said nothing. 
‚Äú‚ÄòCREVV,‚Äô I said. 
No sooner had the word left my lips than a fearsome ivory fang had pierced my vulnerable stomach and sent everything inside me all over the place.‚Äù I was dead. 
You wrap your story about the aliens 
‚ÄúAh. So‚Ä¶you died?‚Äù your sister asks. Yeah. Wait, I didn't tell the story right. Let me start over. 
‚ÄúHmmm. I‚Ä¶doubt it,‚Äù says your sister. 
You told a story about how you got abducted by aliens and died, but your sister doesn‚Äôt seem convinced. 
No one believed you! You failed. Wait, I didn't tell the story right. Start Over 
‚Äú‚ÄòAt this point, you‚Äôre almost conversant in the language. You just have a couple more words to get through. I am now teaching you the word JENCH. It means ‚ÄúGod.‚Äù‚Äô‚Äù I said, ""JENCH."" 
‚ÄúFinally, ‚ÄòThe word BRIDE is the equivalent of the English word ‚Äúum.‚Äù When you say the word BRIDE, it means that you have forgotten how to speak, and you are trying to remember.‚Äô‚Äù I said, ""BRIDE."" 
‚Äú‚ÄòThis concludes this first and only module of alien language for English beginners. Thank you for learning with me. Get out there, start speaking the language, and remember: If I‚Äôm not already dead, please find someone who will kill me!‚Äô 
With that, the teacher handed me a diploma with some inscrutable symbols on it and ushered me out of the Language Room.‚Äù I left the Language Room and went back out to the ship hallway. I went east. 
‚ÄúI was in the ship corridor to the south of the first room.‚Äù I went north.";english;2016-10-28T07:36:44.541+03:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Clickventure: You Were Abducted By Aliens. Will Anyone Ever Believe You?;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3428/2/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Just keep in mind not all of these pointers are for everyone! 
1. Have a really awesome theme: The best Halloween parties are the ones that have a great theme and stick to it, unless that‚Äôs just not a thing your friends would be into. Is it ‚Äúghosts and ghouls‚Äù? Or ‚Äúzombie apocalypse‚Äù? Or maybe your party is the fourth one of the night for your friends, and they don‚Äôt want to spend money on multiple costumes. In that case, maybe a theme isn‚Äôt the way to go. Just ask around, and you‚Äôll be good to go! 
2. Fire up some spooky music: Nothing sets the mood like some classic ‚ÄúMonster Mash.‚Äù However, it‚Äôs entirely possible that your attendees would actually favor a playlist of pop hits to just generally hang out to. No worries, then! Just do what‚Äôs best for you and everyone that‚Äôs planning on coming, and you‚Äôll surely still have a great time, right? 
3. If you‚Äôre not into decorations, you can probably just skip this one: Jack-o‚Äô-lanterns, skeletons, and spiderwebs will all add to the experience of a scary party if that‚Äôs a thing your partygoers would prefer. You know your social group better than we do, so before you blindly take these suggestions, maybe you should simply think about how this will enhance or diminish the experience for your friends specifically. It‚Äôs really not even that hard and would probably be the best tip we could give, anyway. 
4. Make sure to have a mix of really fun party games: Look, we‚Äôre really generalizing here. Is this suggestion for everyone? No. Only you know if your friends will be excited to bob for apples or whatever. We can‚Äôt make individual lists for every goddamn reader so, surprise: You‚Äôre going to have to do a little work, too, and decide if this one is right for your gathering. 
5. Prepare some festive candy-corn cupcakes, or if you hate candy corn or if your friend Alicia has celiac or if you would rather make chocolate cupcakes or if your apartment has a weird gas smell or if you don‚Äôt have the time or if your coworker is in charge of the food or if you think you‚Äôd mess up the recipe really badly or if you made these last year and don‚Äôt want to be typecast as a person who is always making candy-corn cupcakes, or for any of the other infinite disqualifying reasons, do absolutely nothing: Nothing like a sweet treat to bring a Halloween party to the next level. 
6. Don‚Äôt have the party if your friends don‚Äôt like to party on Halloween: We shouldn‚Äôt have to say this, but you don‚Äôt have to throw a party at all. Why did you even read this list if you know your crew hates Halloween? What the hell is wrong with you? Please close this tab, power down your computer, and throw it in the ocean.

If you‚Äôre always making excuses to skip the gym, you‚Äôve got to check this out. 
Let‚Äôs be honest: We all can use a little extra push to get the most out of our workouts. Now, there‚Äôs one spin studio that has a brand-new approach to take motivation to the next level. At SpinZone NYC, they‚Äôve got a great new twist to keep riders active and focused the whole 45 minutes: Every one of their bikes is hooked up to a sick child‚Äôs life support. 
Too cool! Where do we sign up??? 
If you thought spin class was intense before, just wait until you see this setup. With 16 bikes, each hooked up to the equipment needed to keep one child alive, there‚Äôs no doubt that every bit of effort counts‚Äîif you stop pedaling, the machines stop, too. Even with the array of pulsing lights and music we‚Äôve come to expect from spin class, the distinct sound of an EKG flatlining on a 7-year-old can be a powerful motivator to let riders know it‚Äôs time to step things up. 
In an increasingly competitive fitness market, the innovative approach at SpinZone NYC is a breath of fresh air, and it‚Äôs winning them new customers left and right. With no backup generators and no excuses, they‚Äôve created exactly the kind of environment people need to get real results. Instructors are always there to offer a word of encouragement and remind cyclists how severe their child‚Äôs condition is. And forget about plateauing‚Äîonce participants make it through a full session with one sick kid, that just means a bigger and sicker child for the next workout. 
‚ÄúI used to make it 30 minutes, tops,‚Äù said Erika Perry, a regular who says she never breaks eye contact with her kid for extra motivation to keep going. ‚ÄúNow I regularly make it the full class. There‚Äôs something about a child depending on me for survival that really gets me going in the morning. And I‚Äôve dropped 11 pounds and feel great!‚Äù 
Wow, it sounds like things are off to a great start! If this catches on, it‚Äôs exactly the kind of bold idea that can transform an entire industry. Way to go, SpinZone NYC. Keep on pedaling!";english;2016-10-28T18:15:56.606+03:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Life: Move Over, SoulCycle: This Spin Studio Motivates Its Students By Hooking Up Each Bike To A Sick Child‚Äôs Life Support;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3431/2/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

It‚Äôs time to get excited, because Marvel Comics just announced a new superhero that advances diversity in comics in a major way. The series is called Luminary , and it tells the story of a mild-mannered Caucasian man named Percy Pendleton who gains incredible superhuman powers and constantly expresses his regret that he was blessed with those abilities instead of a Latina woman, who could be a role model for young Hispanic girls in addition to merely fighting crime. 
Yes! Marvel deserves major kudos for this massive step toward inclusive representation in comics! 
While working as a nuclear physicist at Stark Industries, Percy is caught in a particle-accelerator explosion. A surge of neutrinos floods his nervous system and transforms him into the incredible Luminary, a hero whose amazing powers of flight, super strength, and energy manipulation make him concerned that as a white man he does nothing to reflect the face of a changing America, which is increasingly Hispanic and female. 
Wow. What a long-overdue breath of fresh air to see a big-name publisher like Marvel feature a white male superhero who thinks it‚Äôs a shame he isn‚Äôt Latina. 
For a glimpse of the groundbreaking work you can look forward to in Luminary #1, check out these sample panels Marvel released earlier this week:

Here Are 7 Thrilling Ways To Frighten Yourself Very Badly In Your Own Car;"Email All Hallows‚Äô Eve comes just once a year! This Halloween, here‚Äôs how you can turn your own car into a traumatically frightening experience! 
1. Create a CD that‚Äôs six hours of silence punctuated by sudden, blood-curdling screams at random intervals and have it playing at all times on maximum volume: Will the next 130-dB shriek sound off in the next 15 seconds or the next 15 minutes? Who knows! Soon, your car will be the talk of all the trick-or-treaters who see you incontinent with fear behind the wheel. 
2. Tow a giant cage filled with several hundred bats behind your car so when you look in your rearview mirror, it always appears as though a cloud of bats is chasing you: This is a one-way ticket to fear‚Äîexactly how October 31 is meant to be spent in your car. 
3. Paint a spooky night sky on the inside of your windshield: A witch on a broom flying in front of a full moon. Ghosts soaring through clouds. A constellation that spells ‚ÄúBOO!‚Äù These are just a few Halloween windshield obstructions that will chill you to the bone. 
4. Tie a rope to each windshield wiper, and then tie the opposite ends of the ropes around the necks of two rabies-infected possums sleeping in your backseat: If it storms, you can be sure that your car will be a regular Dracula‚Äôs possum-infested castle on wheels! 
5. Three words: Car. Window. Guillotines: Imagine it: You‚Äôre rolling up the windows to escape the cold autumn air and suddenly a window-size blade shoots down, nearly severing your arm. This is a car-based Halloween tradition you‚Äôll want to bring back year after year. 
6. Think about Frankenstein unbuckling you: Only for extreme Halloween fanatics‚Äînot for the fainthearted.

So really all I‚Äôm looking for, feedback-wise, is if I‚Äôm grasping the fundamentals of photography on this one. Can we ignore that there‚Äôs clearly a UFO of some sort in the sky? I didn‚Äôt know it was there, and it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in the picture. I already know the spaceship is there; it‚Äôs not constructive for you to tell me again. Do all the lines in the photo draw your eye to the middle? Is there clear depth with the mountains in the distance? Any advice would be great, and again, please ignore the apparent spaceship that, again, was not supposed to be in this photo. 2. In this image, I was trying to frame it correctly for two-point perspective. I think you can pretty much tell that the barn has two vanishing points, and in my opinion, this is pretty good for a newbie. I‚Äôd definitely like some tips for the future, though, to make an image like this more interesting to look at other than the fact that there‚Äôs what appears to be an intergalactic vessel in the sky above it. 3. I don‚Äôt know where the lights in this photo came from, so whether or not they are earthly is completely irrelevant. Personally, I think my camera was just malfunctioning, since I certainly don‚Äôt remember them being present while I was taking this; and night photography can be strange with such long exposures, so things can get weird. Okay, now that we‚Äôve discussed the elephant in the room, let‚Äôs talk about symmetry in this image since that‚Äôs what I was going for. Any thoughts? 4. If one more person tells me that I‚Äôve taken the most important photo in human history and doesn‚Äôt have any input on if there is too much headroom above the mountains or if I used a long enough lens, I am going to scream. 5. Okay, I admit that the UFO is what really drew me into composing this image. That being said, let‚Äôs talk about how it fits into the photograph, not the fact that I actually captured it. Is it a good picture? Possibly. Did I use the rule of thirds successfully? I sure hope so. Is it proof that we aren‚Äôt alone in the universe?

What about the rest? Here are seven mating rituals that showcase nature in all its complexity and beauty. 
Orangutans: Orangutans are among a special group of animals with mating rituals based around the lunar cycle, meaning that whenever a full moon is in the sky, male orangutans will climb the tallest tree and try to have sex with the moon, only settling for a female orangutan once they grow tired of stretching their penises outward so they might touch the moon with it. 
Armadillos: In the ‚ÄúArmadillo‚Äôs song,‚Äù the male armadillo‚Äôs penis makes an annoying high-pitched whirring sound until a female armadillo is so annoyed by it that she silences it by having sex with him. 
Alligators: During mating season, male alligators stand upright and walk around on their hind legs and place their arms on their hips and sometimes even ride bikes until a female alligator gets horny from watching them. 
Beavers: The male beaver and female beaver each recite a fun fact about beavers, taking a step closer to one another as they do so. At some point, they get so close that they‚Äôre actually mating. 
Elephants: Before having sex, the female elephant will coat her male partner in sticky, boiling hot Pepsi that only comes out of her trunk when she‚Äôs ‚Äúin the mood.‚Äù 
Iguanas: When it is time for iguanas to mate, the male iguana climbs on top of a female fox and the female iguana climbs on top of a male fox. The two iguanas ride their foxes straight at each other at full speed, and when the foxes collide with each other, the iguanas are flung forward and collide in midair. As they fly through the air, the male iguana impregnates the female iguana, who sprays eggs in all directions as she hurtles haphazardly toward the sky. When the mating ritual is complete, both iguanas hit the ground and die. 
Bonobos: The male bonobo spends a full year trying to work up the courage to ask for a kiss. If he is rejected or the kiss isn‚Äôt that good, he will crawl up a tree and scream at God for giving him such good lips for kissing but no one to share them with.";english;2016-11-01T18:37:32.022+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Life: 7 Incredible Animal Mating Rituals;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3436/3/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;85;0;85;satire

If you want to see the full depths of human greed, look no further than the city of Chicago. This week, the residents of this selfish city are marching through the streets rooting for their hometown baseball team, the Chicago Cubs, to win the World Series. Yep, you heard that right. The citizens of Chicago want their baseball team to win the World Series even though their city already has a bunch of movie theaters and a zoo. 
Some people just want more and more and more. 
The endless selfishness on display here is just sickening. Apparently having dozens of movie theaters and a whole zoo to enjoy isn‚Äôt enough for the pleasure gluttons of Chicago. They need a big honking World Series victory, too. 
We‚Äôll give you a minute to try to wrap your head around the sheer unbridled avarice of these people. All you have to do is Google ‚ÄúMovie Theaters Chicago,‚Äù and you‚Äôll be flooded with the names and addresses of cinemas all over the city playing both mainstream blockbusters and art house gems, which the people of Chicago can go to whenever they want. And when they aren‚Äôt in the mood for a movie, these spoiled brats can go see exotic creatures from all over the world at the Lincoln Park Zoo. But apparently that‚Äôs not enough to satisfy these unhinged hedonists. No, they need a gigantic parade for the Chicago Cubs cutting right through the middle of their city. They need fountains of champagne and a picture of Anthony Rizzo celebrating on the front page of every major newspaper in the country. 
Hey, Chicago! Maybe if the Cubs win the World Series someone will make a movie about it, and you can go watch it in whichever one of the goddamn dozens of fucking movie theaters in your charmed little city is closest to your house. And then when the movie about your world champion baseball team is over, you can go talk about it while you look at the majestic lowland gorillas that live at your fully functioning goddamn zoo. If you aren‚Äôt sickened by what you see in the mirror, Chicago, it‚Äôs because greed has warped your minds. 
Some people are just never content, no matter how many blessings life serves to them on a silver platter. Apparently the people in Chicago will not be satisfied unless their brains are gushing dopamine in all directions at all times. They have so many movie theaters. They have a zoo. And yet they won‚Äôt be happy until the fucking president of the United States is personally congratulating them for having the best baseball team in the world. Where do they get the gall to desire a World Series victory amid their cornucopia of movie theaters and their zoo? It‚Äôs disgusting. Nothing is ever enough for Chicago.

Yellowstone is home to countless species of birds, mammals, fish, and reptiles, as well as this delicious sausage, which has been carefully secreted somewhere within the confines of the park‚Äôs 3,468.4 square miles, and which is all yours if you find it. 2. Ever since the National Park Service announced that it was hiding this bratwurst somewhere in Yellowstone, annual attendance has skyrocketed 41 percent. And with this plump, tasty brat yet to be found, we can‚Äôt see that number going down anytime soon. 3. This sausage may be missing a bite, but rest assured, it will still be full of meaty flavor if you can find it hidden among Yellowstone‚Äôs many illustrious geysers and canyons. 4. Good luck finding this one before one of Yellowstone‚Äôs many wolves gobbles it up! 5. This kielbasa, hidden in a crack in the basalt of Tower Falls, can only be seen on the full moon closest to the winter solstice, so good luck getting your hands on any of its porky, smoked flavor. 6. The only hint the Park Service is giving for this one is that it‚Äôs near some rocks. 7 . The National Park Service is always looking for ways to make visiting Yellowstone more enjoyable, and by hiding this Middle Eastern sausage in a treasure chest located at the bottom of Shoshone Lake for divers to find, it‚Äôs certainly done just that.

Since Donald Trump entered the election over a year ago, he has single-handedly destroyed the GOP, leaving both the House and the Senate in utter disarray. But although many political strategists believe permanent damage has been done, conservatives shouldn‚Äôt lose hope yet, because Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has just emerged fully nude from an ayahuasca tent with visions of a new Republican Party. 
A fresh GOP platform requires fresh leadership, and when Speaker Ryan journeyed to South America last week to embark on an immersive psychedelic vision quest of political rebirth, he just proved he‚Äôs the only one for the job. 
After traveling to Peru and entering a makeshift tent with nothing but a towel, 200 mg of DMT, and a bucket to vomit in, Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spent the last 12 hours lying nude on the jungle floor, enduring bursts of vivid consciousness in which he watched the secrets of a unified, more moderate GOP unfold before his very eyes. 
While under the influence of the powerful psychedelic, ancient spiritual guides appeared before the congressman, instructed him to remove his clothes, and held him down as lifelike projections of Republican leaders twisted and contorted around him until the perfect cabinet had revealed itself amid infinite realities in which tax cuts and fiscal budgets exploded into cacophonous symphonies, all to create a Republican Party that mobilizes key voter constituencies. 
Check out these tweets he posted just a few moments after emerging nude from his tent in the Amazon rain forest! 
Whoa. Democrats have been pretty confident this past year, but if Paul Ryan‚Äôs visions of the Republican party are right, they better watch out! 
Say what you want about Paul Ryan, but he‚Äôs a man who refuses to give up. On the one hand, is it possible that the speaker‚Äôs grand ayahuasca visions of a new Republican Party are just a temporary fix? Sure. But on the other hand, if he plays his cards right, his proposals could have an even larger impact than they did during the thousands of years he lived while trapped inside his own mind. 
One thing is for sure: Paul Ryan emerged fully nude from that ayahuasca tent with a new perspective, and people are starting to take notice.";english;2016-11-01T19:32:59.954+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Hope For The GOP: A Nude Paul Ryan Has Just Emerged From An Ayahuasca Tent With Visions Of A New Republican Party;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3436/8/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Meditation is some pretty awesome stuff, and the practice is finding its way into more and more lives every day. Now a program at Cedar Creek Middle School in Portland, ME is proving that meditation can have a major impact. By meditating just 15 minutes a day, nearly all of the kids in the program have seen lower stress levels and higher test scores, and three of them have gone absolutely insane. 
What a remarkable result! 
The program, called Mindful Kids, encourages students to sit silently in a darkened classroom for 15 minutes a day and listen to white noise. Six weeks in, the effects were already striking: Most of the students had noticeably improved behavior and were more engaged in their schoolwork, and three of them had pulled out all of their hair and created their own language that they speak through their nostrils. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs astounding,‚Äù said Colin Creedman, the teacher who started the program. ‚ÄúWe expected the meditation to cause some improvement, but we didn‚Äôt plan on it having such a big impact. ‚ÄòC‚Äô students became ‚ÄòA‚Äô students. There have been no fights. Three of them started worshipping a Bunsen burner as their god. And they‚Äôre much more focused in class. Anyone who‚Äôs skeptical of the effectiveness of meditation really needs to meet these kids.‚Äù 
The students in the program have noticed some big differences, too. ‚ÄúI feel more calm,‚Äù said 11-year-old Melissa Hogseth. ‚ÄúNot just during the meditation, but throughout the day. I think it‚Äôs great for kids to meditate.‚Äù 
Ten-year-old Jason Woodward says he also has benefited from meditating: ‚ÄúMy blood has become pure mercury. I can absorb shadows now. Meditation has helped me focus my energy into a beam that can cut glass and, soon, flesh and bone.‚Äù 
Unbelievable! The brain is an amazing thing, and these kids prove that meditation can unlock its full potential and sometimes make it go batshit insane.

2. They ate two raw eggs every morning, two raw eggs in the afternoon, and two raw eggs after sundown, because that‚Äôs just what you did. 
3. They were 40 feet tall, with long, terrible teeth, and arms thick as a clipper‚Äôs mast! And their awful strength was matched only by their appetites! 
4. They know that this is the best way to tie a tie: 
5. They were married by age 18, had a house by 20, sucked the tongue out of a jackal‚Äôs mouth by 23, had their arms and legs ripped off on the radio by 25, and did it all over again by 36. 
6. Some of them were named ‚ÄúLeland,‚Äù which is wild. 
7. They could get under the hood of any car and tell you exactly how they‚Äôd fuck it. 
8. The previous holder of that title was the generation that came up with the idea for pets, so you gotta think this one‚Äôs pretty great. 
9. They never threw anything out if they could tuck it under one of their folds. 
10. You could kill 100 or even 200 of them, and you still wouldn‚Äôt have killed all of them. 
11. When it really, really mattered, they put aside differences of race, creed, sex, and nationality to do World War II. 
12. They drove the hideous Tasmanian tiger extinct. 
13. They‚Äôre definitely the last generation to ever witness this in person: 
14. Many of them live underground. Pretty impressive! 
15. Their ranks include Frank Sinatra, John Travolta‚Äôs dad, and Dagwood from Blondie . 
16. They never left a man behind. That‚Äôs why we have Bruce. 
17. They fought for civil rights, but also against civil rights, but they won the fight, but they really tried pretty hard to shut that fight down, so maybe that one‚Äôs kind of a wash. 
18. They probably invented tarp, the outdoor silk. 
19. They learned the kind of dignity and poise that makes this happen when they enter a room:

Sit next to Elton John on a flight and you‚Äôll see a man living in the lap of luxury, as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip. The platinum-selling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear, and then quickly retract it to mark the animal‚Äôs triumphant return. He will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight. 2. A Great White Shark Leaping Into The Air 
When you‚Äôre an international pop sensation worth an estimated $450 million, people go the extra mile to make you happy. Flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in Elton John‚Äôs seat-back pocket before he even boards the plane. The five-time Grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying, sometimes holding it a mere 3-to-4 inches away from his face while he fixates upon the shark‚Äôs beady eyes. 3.

Rumor has it Elton John first acquired this shark photo in 1997, just before flying to London to perform ‚ÄúCandle In The Wind‚Äù at Princess Diana‚Äôs funeral. It‚Äôs been a staple of his travel routine ever since. Those who have flown with the music legend say that Sir Elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass. 4. Two Hammerhead Sharks 
How does the man behind ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù and ‚ÄúRocket Man‚Äù handle turbulence as his plane traverses the Atlantic? Once that ‚ÄúFasten Seat Belts‚Äù sign lights up, this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out. Elton John holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes, often without blinking for minutes at a time. 5. The Poster For Jaws 
Sir Elton John absolutely adores the poster for Steven Spielberg‚Äôs Jaws and hopes to one day see the film. In the meantime, the British icon makes do by slowly unfolding his 24-by-36-inch copy of the poster whenever he‚Äôs on a long flight, gently tracing the shark‚Äôs teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth. 6. Pilot‚Äôs Choice 
As much as Elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation, he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from London to a distant corner of Europe. That‚Äôs why all pilots who fly Sir Elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport, and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff.

For friends and family who loved him dearly, the death of Robert Harkin in early August was sudden and unexpected. But despite their sadness, they can take comfort in knowing that his legacy will live on. His sister Karen has taken over his Facebook page and honors her brother by continuing to share Islamophobic rhetoric in his memory. 
Absolutely beautiful. 
They rarely chose to talk about politics while he was alive, but Karen has been able to reconnect with her brother since his death by discovering his fear and hatred of Islam. It‚Äôs been a steep learning curve, but in time she‚Äôs been able to understand so much about what he cared about most, and she now feels closer to him than ever. The threat Syrian refugees pose to our freedom, the politicians who willingly turn a blind eye to the rising threat of Islamic terrorism‚Äîall of the bigoted beliefs that made Robert who he was. 
Since picking up the mantle of his Facebook account, Karen has committed to maintaining the xenophobia that exemplified her brother‚Äôs life. When Time magazine ran a story about a Muslim woman who felt unsafe in America, Karen understood right away that Robert would want to share the article with the comment ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôd feel more safe if she moved to Saudia Arabia where she can practice Sharia Law with the rest of them.‚Äù Sometimes a sister just knows. 
For those who were close to Robert, seeing a backwards, misinformed post decrying the spread of radical Islam is like being with him again. His page is a place where those who knew him can come share a memory and talk about the spread of Sharia law‚Äîexactly what Robert would have wanted. Whenever she posts about the inherent violence in the Muslim faith, Karen takes comfort in knowing that with every like and share, her brother remains a vibrant part of peoples‚Äô lives. 
‚ÄúIn the wake of Robert‚Äôs death, I think everyone was just looking for a place to see hateful rhetoric,‚Äù says Karen, who remembers her brother by spending two to three hours per day scouring the internet for signs of a larger Islamic conspiracy. ‚ÄúI miss him every day. But as long as I continue to invite his Facebook friends to like a group whose mission is to block the construction of mosques in America, it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs still here.‚Äù 
Wow, if only everyone had such a devoted sister! Wherever he is, Robert must be resting easy knowing his sister is there to share his hateful, paranoid beliefs with the world.";english;2016-11-03T09:50:11.568+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Life: Touching: After Her Brother Passed Away, This Woman Took Over His Facebook Page To Continue Sharing Islamophobic Rhetoric;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3436/9/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Last night the Chicago Cubs eked out a thrilling game 7 victory in the World Series against the Cleveland Indians and ended a championship drought that had lasted for 108 years. This is a historic moment to be sure, but there will be no smiling and cheering in Chicago: Fans of the Cubs are still too sad over the death of Princess Diana to do any celebrating. 
‚ÄúI honestly never thought I‚Äôd see the Cubs bring home the trophy, but everyone here is still too swept up with grief over Lady Di to really enjoy themselves right now,‚Äù said Cubbies superfan Raymon Lindley, who was among the thousands of fans who gathered outside Wrigley Field following last night‚Äôs edge-of-your-seat game to light candles in memory of the late Princess Of Wales. ‚ÄúIt would be macabre to celebrate the win in light of what happened to Princess Diana on that fateful August night in 1997.‚Äù 
Theo Epstein, the curse-breaking president of baseball operations for the Cubs, has shipped the World Series trophy overseas to Britain, where it is to be laid on the grave of the People‚Äôs Princess. While the people of Chicago are undoubtedly proud of their Cubs, no parade has been planned, as the general feeling of the city is that it would be too gratuitous at this time. 
‚ÄúI just called my 91-year-old grandfather, who waited his whole life to see the Cubs win the World Series,‚Äù said longtime season-ticket holder Karen Hunter. ‚ÄúWe spent the entire call crying about Princess Diana together. She was so young.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI would give a thousand Cubs World Series wins if Lady Di could be alive for one more day,‚Äù Hunter added. 
History has been made, and the Cubs finally have their much-sought-after championship, but fans clearly still have a long way to go before they‚Äôre comfortable celebrating the historic achievement. Aside from the occasional outburst of ‚ÄúCandle In The Wind‚Äù by groups of bereft fans, Wrigleyville will remain a quiet and mournful place until the Cubs faithful are ready to party with their victorious hometown heroes. And it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess as to when that will be.";english;2016-11-04T04:33:51.120+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: A Somber Moment: Cubs Fans All Over The World Are Still Too Sad About Princess Diana To Celebrate The Cubs‚Äô World Series;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3439/8/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

It should come as no surprise that the $100 billion bottled-water industry is pretty much the polar opposite of environmental sustainability. Fortunately, one of the biggest producers of bottled water is taking some real action to go green: Poland Spring is fighting the accumulation of plastic waste with a new campaign that highlights how terrible their bottled water tastes. 
Now here is a company that gets it. 
‚ÄúWe just want to get the word out that our crystal-clear water tastes truly awful,‚Äù said Janet Connor, senior VP of marketing for Poland Spring. ‚ÄúEvery year, 38 billion plastic water bottles are thrown out. In order to minimize the impact we have on the environment, we wanted to remind people that drinking our fresh spring water is an unpleasant ordeal from the first sip to the last. Given the option, it would be a better idea to drink hot wolf piss.‚Äù 
As part of the campaign, Poland Spring is marshaling their full resources behind the effort, including print and billboard placements that advertise their water as ‚Äúa miserable experience for your mouth.‚Äù To support these efforts, social campaigns using the hashtag #MyPolandSpringTastesLike will encourage users to share the first time they tried the company‚Äôs bottled water, and to pull no punches when it comes to describing the excruciating flavor. 
Poland Spring has even updated its website to reflect their new focus: 
Wow! What a huge win for the environment! It‚Äôs nice to see that the folks at Poland Spring are willing to describe their product as Satan‚Äôs vomit if it means making this planet a better place.

1. Phrase your request carefully: It‚Äôs absolutely imperative that when you ask the man who currently has his hand on your knee for a raise, you are respectful and conscious. Nail down every word in your request beforehand, so that when the time comes, the man with his hand on your knee is inspired, but not threatened. 
2. Anticipate your talking points: Ask yourself: Is your employer data-conscious? Is your parent company in a good financial position to give out raises right now? Are five sweaty fingers simply resting on your knee, or are they moving around, toying playfully with the fabric on your pants? As you‚Äôre sitting across from the man controlling those fingers, make sure you‚Äôre constantly asking yourself these types of questions, because if you do, you‚Äôre guaranteed to step up your negotiation skills tenfold! 
3. Assume a stance that is confident but also gently pushes his hand off your knee: Whether you‚Äôre crossing your legs to subtly shake his hand off your knee or swiveling your chair to guide his palm onto the armrest of your chair, try to use your body to signal confidence, rather than looking fidgety. After all, visual cues are just as important as verbal ones. So when you sit down in his office and notice the hand on your leg or rubbing your upper arm, look like the valuable employee you truly know you are! 
4. Make sure to ask for an exact salary before the man‚Äôs fingers start moving up your leg: It might seem daunting at first to directly ask for money, but if you don‚Äôt come with an exact number in mind, the man with his hand on your knee will end up confused, with little direction information about how much of a bump to give you. Calculate an appropriate new salary so you can bargain, but when you do, avoid mentioning the salaries of any other coworkers whose legs he has also touched, because this is about you, not them! 
5. Don‚Äôt mention the hand: A real negotiator stays on target and doesn‚Äôt let day-to-day work conversations creep into business. Mentioning or even looking at the hand is a surefire way to upset the man with his hand on your knee and bring the meeting to a close without getting a raise. Keep your message laser-focused! 
6. Be prepared for a no: Look, you might not get a raise this time, but don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not personal! That‚Äôs just business, and sometimes you have to ask once, twice, or even three more times before the man with his hand on your knee finally gives you a raise. And if he doesn‚Äôt, who knows?

If you ask any meat eater to describe what it was like to be carnivorous in the ‚Äô90s, don‚Äôt be surprised if they reply with their best imitation of this iconic sizzle. 2. This. Sound. The original ‚Äô90s sizzle. The good ol‚Äô days when this could be heard across every American grill. While it held enough broad appeal for child meat eaters to enjoy, it always had something a little naughty just for the parents to understand. No smartphones necessary to appreciate this classic griddle noise. 3. Meat eaters in the ‚Äô90s went wild when in the now-classic episode of Friends ‚ÄúThe One Where Joey Ruins Labor Day,‚Äù Joey and Chandler fired up the grill, threw on some burgers and then‚Ä¶well, if you haven‚Äôt seen the episode, you won‚Äôt get it. 4. Keen listeners will know this one is straight from the summer of ‚Äô95, from the Johnson family‚Äôs burger barbecue in Orlando, FL. 5. If you‚Äôve never woken up with this sound stuck in your head, it‚Äôs because you either weren‚Äôt around in the ‚Äô90s, weren‚Äôt eating meat then, or both. 6. The ‚Äô70s were all about hissing, and the ‚Äô80s featured their fair share of crackling.

He‚Äôs an absolute mess, and he‚Äôs incapable of looking after himself. Do you think you have what it takes to be his live-in caretaker? 1. Before we get started, you need to understand that this is not a glamorous job. Yoda is miserable to be around, he needs constant supervision, and his hygiene is appalling. Caring for him is an around-the-clock gig, and it requires an extraordinary level of patience and compassion. You‚Äôre going to have to put up with a lot of bullshit. That‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm confident I can handle whatever challenges the job throws my way. Wow, that sounds pretty difficult. I suppose I‚Äôd just have to try my best and hope I do a good job. Honestly, I don‚Äôt really have any experience with anything like this. I already know that I would do a terrible job. 2. One of the most important aspects of the job is tending to Yoda‚Äôs skincare needs. His skin is dry, flaky, and covered in sores, and it needs to be rubbed down several times a day with a special prescription lotion. Unfortunately, Yoda hates being touched, and he won‚Äôt let you put the lotion on without a fight. Sometimes he‚Äôll spray you with his stink gland or try to bite you. Other times he‚Äôll scurry underneath the couch and try to dig a hole in the floor to hide in, frantically scratching at the carpet until his hooves are bloody and raw. With this in mind, how would you go about getting him to cooperate with you for his skin treatments? Using simple terms he can understand, I‚Äôd explain to him why the skin treatments are necessary, and I‚Äôd work with him to figure out what, exactly, he doesn‚Äôt enjoy about them and then use that information to tailor the process for him so that it‚Äôs as painless and comfortable as possible. I would trap him underneath a laundry basket until he burns off all his combative energy. Then, once he‚Äôs tuckered out, I would pin him to the floor with my knee and apply the lotion to his skin as quickly as possible before he gets a second wind. I‚Äôd spread a thin layer of the lotion around the inside of a garbage bag. Then, I‚Äôd roll a tennis ball past Yoda to create a distraction, and while his attention is diverted, I would run over and stuff him inside the garbage bag. I‚Äôd shake him up and down inside the bag until his body was covered in lotion, and then I would dump him out on a mat of paper towels to clean off any excess lotion. I would really rather not touch his gross skin, so I‚Äôd probably just leave the lotion out on the counter for him. 3. Yoda always makes a huge fuss about eating his fruits and vegetables, and if he had his way, he would live entirely off of Slim Jims. How would you ensure that he‚Äôs eating a healthy, nutritious diet and not just Slim Jims? I would make him healthy vegetarian Slim Jims out of ground mushrooms, spices, lentils, and other wholesome ingredients‚Äîhe wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell the difference! I would dip all of his Slim Jims in nail polish remover to make them taste horrible, leaving him no choice but to eat the vegetables if he doesn‚Äôt want to go hungry. I would tell him that his nemesis Count Dooku is coming to spay him, and the only way for him to get strong enough to fight back is if he fills himself up on powerful vitamins and minerals, like the ones found in fruits and vegetables. I would mash the fruits and vegetables into a paste and force the paste down his throat with my fingers. 4. Yoda spends hours each morning tending to a patch of weeds out back that he refers to as his ‚Äúcrops.‚Äù It‚Äôs pretty harmless‚Äîhe mostly just sprays the hose and drags a rake around a bit‚Äîbut if you don‚Äôt keep an eye on him, he‚Äôll sneak away and try to find ‚Äúthe Chosen One.‚Äù That‚Äôs what he calls the trash-eating swamp pelican that lives in the pond behind the house. It‚Äôs unclear why he thinks this pelican is so special, but he‚Äôs already given it his lightsaber and all of his money in an effort to help it ‚Äúdefeat the dark side.‚Äù This is all nonsense, of course, and it‚Äôs important to make sure Yoda doesn‚Äôt give any more of his valuables to this bird. What measures would you take to keep Yoda away from ‚Äúthe Chosen One‚Äù? I would tether him to the house with a length of rope that‚Äôs long enough for him to freely tend to his ‚Äúcrops‚Äù but too short for him to wander off to places he shouldn‚Äôt be. I would dress Yoda in a vest covered in flashing lights and bells, which would scare the pelican away should it ever try to approach. Shock collar. I would shoot the pelican with a gun and then make Yoda eat its disgusting meat so that he realizes that the bird isn‚Äôt special. 5. There‚Äôs nothing in the world that Yoda enjoys more than watching pornography. However, doing so gets him extremely riled up, and his doctor has warned that his heart is no longer strong enough to handle excitement like this. Nonetheless, Yoda will still try to watch porn any chance he gets, and the only way to curb this habit is to reprimand him when he does. How would you reprimand Yoda for watching porn? I would revoke his TV and computer privileges for the rest of the day and have him use his time to do something constructive instead. I would put an oven mitt over his head and duct-tape it in place so he‚Äôd be physically incapable of looking at porn‚Äîor anything else, for that matter. I would leave the oven mitt over his head for an entire day. I would strip off all his clothes and parade him around town so that he could see how it feels to have strangers stare at him when he‚Äôs naked. I would charge people $5 to take pictures with naked Yoda, and I would spend all the money on something he hates. I would put him in the oven and pretend like I was going to cremate him, and I would only take him out if he promised to never look at porn again. 6. One thing to be aware of is that Yoda is very afraid of airplanes. If he hears a commercial jet flying overhead, he‚Äôll freak out and try to use the Force to make it crash. Granted, he‚Äôs probably not strong enough anymore to actually cause any harm, but just be aware that that‚Äôs a thing he might do. Got it. I‚Äôll make sure he doesn‚Äôt try to down any airplanes. If Yoda wants to make an airplane crash, who am I to stop him? 7. Yoda has no family or friends, but he does have a catfish named Obi-Wan that he keeps in a cigar box next to his bed. He talks quietly to the catfish for several hours each night, but what he doesn‚Äôt realize is that the catfish is dead. Yoda‚Äôs doctor is concerned that he‚Äôs formed an unhealthy attachment to the catfish, and he has strongly suggested taking the catfish away from him before he becomes any more emotionally invested in it. How would you go about taking Yoda‚Äôs catfish away from him while also minimizing the emotional devastation that will result from losing his treasured companion? I would get Yoda a fishbowl and his very own pet goldfish. Once he has a real, live fish to take care of, I trust he‚Äôll begin losing interest in Obi-Wan, and I will then gradually start weaning the dead fish out of his life. While Yoda is sleeping, I would secretly put a small speaker inside of Obi-Wan‚Äôs belly and wirelessly connect it to a microphone that I could use to make the dead catfish ‚Äútalk.‚Äù Then, the following day when Yoda is having his alone time with Obi-Wan, I would have the catfish say, ‚ÄúYoda, if you truly care about me, please flush me down the toilet so I can go live with my family in the sewer.‚Äù Hopefully he would feel comfortable parting with his companion if he thought it was what the dead catfish wanted. I would tell Yoda that Count Dooku is coming to make Obi-Wan into a delicious po‚Äô boy sandwich, and the only way for him to thwart his nemesis is to run outside and toss Obi-Wan into the swamp pond so he can swim away to safety. I would throw Obi-Wan in the trash and then lock Yoda in a cupboard until he stops crying. Get results Results for Do You Have What It Takes To Be Yoda‚Äôs Live-In Caretaker?

Step 2: Get the weed‚Äîthe dark fruit, the bush that grows in the shadow of the valley of the shadow of weed, the jester‚Äôs hiccup, the liquid daydream fresh from the ice-cube tray, the wisdom tooth of the vegetables ogre, Israeli nightshade, the Arizona iced tea of drugs, the dad baffler, the sweet teen poison, the sickly crop of the wind farm, the flower the devil dares not pick‚Äîout of your fridge.

Step 4: Get your rolling paper by stripping a few inches of skin off the Paper Wretch with a hot carrot peeler. It may take a few tries to get a good swath! Step 5: To break up the weed, place it on an active fault line in a bowl full of gravel. Step 6: Once a major tectonic event has ground your weed, pound it into a paste using a book about a curious incident. Step 7: Wrap your index finger in paper and feed the weed paste into your port.

Over the past year, a few high-profile court cases involving rape have spurred an intense national discussion on the topic. Whether it was Brock Turner, a Stanford swimmer who was sentenced to six months in a county jail for his rape of an unconscious woman, or Owen Labrie, a student at an elite prep school who raped a 14-year-old classmate but was arraigned on lesser charges, our justice system has tried to convict rapists with varying degrees of success. As a father, I look at these cases, and I can‚Äôt help but worry for my children. In times like these, we must take a stand, and we must teach our sons that being brought to trial and then convicted of rape is simply, utterly wrong. 
Our children, and more specifically, our boys, need to know that they should never, under any circumstances, be put in a situation where they could potentially lose a case accusing them of sexual assault. My son knows that, and every parent should make an effort to teach their boys the same. 
Whether they made the vile, unforgivable mistake of having a bad lawyer, calling an unreliable witness, or openly admitting to their crime to an undecided jury, America‚Äôs youth must understand that being convicted of rape should never, ever happen. Going to court for sexual assault is one thing, but being declared guilty is quite another, and as responsible parents, we need to do everything in our power to ensure that no child crosses that line, no questions asked. 
Bottom line, we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape, not now, not ever. 
I don‚Äôt care who you are‚Äîif you have a son, you need to teach him that being convicted of rape, even just one time, is unforgivable. The truth is, the moment your boy loses a rape trial is the moment that lives are ruined, and there‚Äôs absolutely no taking that back. 
As a father of a young man myself, I would not be able to live with myself if he someday went to jail just because of something as easily preventable as a sexual assault conviction. When I look into my 8-year-old Callum‚Äôs eyes, the last thing I want to think about is my little guy becoming the type of man who can‚Äôt somehow weasel his way out of a high-profile court case, in front of all his friends, family, and the public at large. 
Bottom line, we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape, not now, not ever. Because if we want this generation of boys to grow into men that we truly take pride in, we have to start teaching them that any young man who gets punished for rape brings shame not only to himself but also to his gender, and this country as a whole. 
So please, don‚Äôt wait. Please talk to your son today about his responsibility to never be convicted of rape, and to speak up if he ever sees someone else in danger of being convicted of rape. Our future depends on it.";english;2016-11-05T01:09:27.704+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Blog: We Need To Teach Our Sons That Being Convicted Of Rape Is Wrong;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3440/4/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Well, this isn‚Äôt good. 
Most people think of Costco as the place that sells bulk quantities of pretty much everything. But the warehouse superstore is now making headlines for a very different reason, and it could serve to tarnish their brand: The Blue Angels accidentally flew into the Costco in Augusta, GA and are currently stuck flying around inside the discount retailer. 
Worst of all, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Costco has any idea how to get the airplane stunt squadron to leave. 
The Blue Angels were performing at a routine air show in Augusta, GA earlier today when they veered too close to the Costco and zipped through the automatic doors as they slid open for a customer. Before Costco employees could react, the diamond formation of five F/A-18 Hornets had entered the store and began performing death-defying aerial feats right over the shelves of bulk cereals and jumbo-size ketchups. 
Customers are trying to ignore the roaring jets overhead, but it‚Äôs hard to concentrate on your shopping list when sonic booms keep knocking over pallets of Kirkland-brand dog food. It‚Äôs usually a welcome treat to see the Blue Angels conduct synchronized barrel rolls, but inside Costco, the elite pilots are proving to be a serious nuisance. 
So far all attempts to evict the Blue Angels have proved unsuccessful. At first, Costco staff just propped the front door open with a bucket, assuming the Blue Angels would find their way back out eventually. After an hour, when choreographed smoke trails continued to plague the store, the manager grabbed a lacrosse stick from a sporting goods display and tried to shoo the planes toward the exit. Unfortunately, that only caused the Blue Angels to accelerate to 700 mph and perform several loop-the-loops in the freezer aisle, where the pilots hit a truly exhilarating 8 G‚Äôs. 
Your heart just has to break for this poor manager. 
With the store set to close in only a few hours, Costco better think up a solution fast, or Blue Angels will be locked in overnight. If that happens, then tomorrow‚Äôs customers will be aggravated by more of the same world-class aeronautic showmanship. What an absolute hassle.";english;2016-11-07T20:11:37.142+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Major Headache: The Blue Angels Got Trapped Inside A Costco, And No One Knows How To Get Them Back Outside;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3444/1/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Grab a box of tissues, because this story is about to make you feel some big-time feels. 
Two years ago, John Fitzpatrick got the most devastating phone call of his life when he learned that his brother Robert had died of a heart attack in his sleep. John instantly thought of Robert‚Äôs 18-year-old daughter, Sophie, who was just starting to forge her path in life. That‚Äôs when this amazing uncle decided to step up in a seriously inspiring way: With Robert no longer there for her, John took it upon himself to discourage his niece‚Äôs art career. 
Okay, is someone cutting onions in here? Because we‚Äôre getting just a little bit teary. 
Ever since his brother‚Äôs passing, John has made it a point to call his niece every single Sunday evening to remind Sophie just how much her father loved her, how proud he‚Äôd be if he could see her now, and how unstable a career in the arts can be compared to more traditional nine-to-five employment. Sophie‚Äôs true passion in life has always been drawing and painting, but thanks to her selfless uncle‚Äôs constant reminders that almost nobody actually ends up working their dream job, she‚Äôs now just two years away from getting her BA in marketing! 
‚ÄúI want Sophie to know that she can always depend on me,‚Äù John explained, gazing tearfully at an old photograph of Robert holding his baby girl. ‚ÄúBut she cannot depend on freelance income, especially in a field as oversaturated and undervalued as the arts. She‚Äôs way too smart for that.‚Äù 
John has never faltered in his commitment to making sure his niece understands just how unrealistic it is to earn a living as an artist. Last summer, when Sophie landed an internship at a Brooklyn art gallery, John spent countless hours reminding her that New York is expensive, dangerous, and very far away from Ohio, before ultimately finding her a job doing administrative work for his friend instead. And when Sophie briefly considered getting a double major in studio art, her uncle pulled out all the stops, even going so far as to gain control of her late father‚Äôs finances so that he could temporarily withhold the semester‚Äôs tuition check until she changed her mind! 
Incredible! Is there an Uncle of the Year award? Because this guy definitely just won it. 
While nobody can ever take the place of Sophie‚Äôs father, it is seriously heartwarming to see John step up to the plate like this. Sophie is so lucky to have an uncle she can always turn to for love, guidance, and stacks of brochures for MBA programs handed to her at every family holiday.

In an election season full of anger and divisiveness, it‚Äôs easy to lose sight of just how important and meaningful our democratic process is. Thankfully, as millions have cast their ballots today, there‚Äôs been no shortage of heartwarming stories involving Americans exercising their right to vote. One of those stories centers around lifelong Mississippi resident Helen Karnes, who, although not quite old enough to have been born before women won the right to vote, is still pretty goddam old. 
Wow. What a special woman! 
While Karnes can‚Äôt claim that she was alive during a time when women were still politically disenfranchised, it just takes one look at her to tell that she‚Äôs fucking old. No, she might not have the inspiring, thematically satisfying story of a 100-year-old, but you get the sense that she‚Äôs definitely lived through some shit. She was certainly around in WWII times, and she might‚Äôve even been there for the Depression, too. Who knows? This is no spring chicken we‚Äôre talking about here. 
Though, admittedly, Karnes‚Äô story would be a bit cooler if she‚Äôd been alive before 1920, you still have to applaud her for being old on this historic Election Day. Also, her mom and her aunts were definitely alive before women‚Äôs suffrage, so you know she‚Äôs probably got some good secondhand stories that she heard from them. Maybe one of them was even an important figure in the women‚Äôs rights movement or something. Statistically speaking, that‚Äôs probably not the case, but you never know! 
It‚Äôs unclear if Karnes voted today for America‚Äôs first female presidential nominee, or if she even voted at all. But what matters is that she‚Äôs brittle, stooped-over, and ancient. There are probably lots of dusty ol‚Äò bats out there who are older than Karnes and who have more of a substantial foothold in U.S. women‚Äôs history, but this lady is still more or less a living skeleton. And that‚Äôs something that should make us all proud to be Americans.";english;2016-11-09T00:24:44.082+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Inspiring: This Woman Wasn‚Äôt Born Before Women Could Vote, But She‚Äôs Still Pretty Fucking Old;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3446/3/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

In case this election wasn‚Äôt already infuriating enough, here‚Äôs something that‚Äôs really going to make your blood boil. With hours to go before polls close, voter watchdog groups across the country are reporting that many laser tag establishments are staying open today. 
This is seriously alarming news. 
In what appears to be a concerted effort to prevent Americans from casting their ballots on time, dozens of laser tag locations are keeping normal business hours on Election Day, inviting one and all to enjoy nonstop laser tag action with all the coolest terrain and equipment. 
If true, this could represent voter suppression on an unprecedented, scarcely conceivable scale. It‚Äôs appalling to see laser tag places‚Äîsome of them located within blocks of polling stations in swing states‚Äîdeploying everything from signs to roadside billboards to social media posts in an attempt to stop Americans from exercising their civic duty. Just take a look at this truly disgusting tweet: 
George Washington is rolling over in his grave right now. 
According to Leanne Holst, spokesman for the watchdog group Voter Vigilance, laser tag may only be the tip of the iceberg. 
‚ÄúSome of these laser tag facilities are continuing to operate roller rinks, 18-hole mini golf courses, and go-kart tracks in a shameless ploy to lure voters as far as possible from the booths,‚Äù said Holst. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an utterly transparent tactic, and the saddest thing is just how effective it can be. Laser tag arenas represent a grave, immediate threat to the democratic process.‚Äù 
Below, via Voter Vigilance, is a partial, ongoing list of laser tag places that have not closed for Election Day, and several with the sheer audacity to offer off-peak, daytime discounts. Lightspeed Go-Karts & Laser Tag (Greenfield, WI) Code Red Laser Tag (Dallas-Fort Worth, TX) Laser Tag Kingdom (Monroe, NH) QZAR (Carle Place, NY) Laser Quest (numerous locations nationwide) Zap Zone (Sterling Heights, MI) Battle Blast Laser Tag (Las Vegas, NV) Lazer Kraze Laser Tag (Erlanger, KY)

Despite the fact that voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, only 60 percent of eligible voters turn out in a presidential election. But this year we may see that number spike, because groups of incredible volunteers are doing everything they can to get out the vote: They‚Äôre hitting the road and oiling up the sidewalks to help voters slide uncontrollably to their polling places. 
Democracy FTW! 
You might not know their names, but these hardworking men and women are out there in the trenches from Maine to California, slathering thick, black oil on the ground so every American can skid down the road, windmilling their arms wildly to try and stay upright, and careen straight through the doors of a voting booth. Republican or Democrat, these patriotic volunteers want every American to have access to a frictionless slick of oil that leads right to a polling place. 
Yes! These incredible volunteers are absolutely killing it! 
Rather than letting our election be decided by a select few, people from across the nation are volunteering their time to make sidewalks well-lubricated and slippery for as many voters as possible. As of this morning, footpaths have been oiled in all 50 states, giving people who would not otherwise have the time or desire to vote the opportunity to lose their balance and slide forward at alarming speeds with their arms flailing and legs kicking, until they crash face-first into a registered polling location. 
We might live in a democracy, but we wouldn‚Äôt have a truly representative election without the help of a select few everyday heroes. So when the polling stations close and every last slippery, oil-covered voter has put their ballot in the box and slid back out the door, remember those brave volunteers, because we couldn‚Äôt do it without them.";english;2016-11-09T00:24:44.205+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Democracy Win: Volunteers Across The Country Are Oiling Up The Sidewalks To Help Voters Slide Uncontrollably To Their Polling Place;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3446/0/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;900;0;900;satire

If this doesn‚Äôt prove what‚Äôs beautiful about America, we don‚Äôt know what does. 
Politically, Sarah Goodwin and Colleen Cassidy agree on almost nothing. They vehemently oppose the other‚Äôs candidate of choice and couldn‚Äôt differ more on the direction our country should be heading in. Yet, as this heatedly divisive election cycle comes to a head, these two demonstrated just how powerful a united American people can be when we put our differences aside and work together: Sarah, a Trump supporter, and Colleen, a Clinton supporter, held each other‚Äôs hair back while vomiting out of intense election anxiety. 
In a campaign season as contentious as this one, you really have to stop and appreciate moments like this. 
Though Sarah and Colleen come from opposite ends of the political spectrum, you wouldn‚Äôt know it when looking into the stall at their polling station in Cranford, NJ, where they both lowered their heads into the same trash can and took turns holding each other‚Äôs hair back as they retched over the psychological toll this long, strenuous election‚Äôs taken on them. No arguing, no finger-pointing, no name-calling: just dual streams of stress-induced upchuck crescendoing in a duet of dry-heaving. The sight of two people, who have been bombarded for months with messages that the other candidate will completely ruin the country as they know it, patting one another on the back and encouraging each other to get it all out, is all too welcome in an otherwise toxic and polarizing campaign season. 
Need more proof that it‚Äôs possible for Trump and Clinton supporters to overcome their shared animosity during this historical moment of anxiety? Colleen even offered Sarah an Altoid once they‚Äôd both stopped throwing up and cleaned the barf from their shirts. Further, Sarah graciously let Colleen borrow her eyeliner, which had been smudged due to the tears summoned by a panic attack she experienced while in line to vote. After checking in to make sure the other was feeling all right one last time, each went their separate ways, having found rare common ground with their political opposites in the form of sickening anxiety stoked by the intense fear politics and extremist partisan rhetoric deployed in the 2016 election. 
Yup, the spirit of Abraham Lincoln is alive, knitting a torn nation back together. 
Look at the media and you‚Äôll see interactions between Trump and Clinton supporters portrayed as vitriolic and irreconcilably at odds.

Well, if this doesn‚Äôt inspire you to do your civic duty, nothing will! 
When California resident Candice Payne woke up this morning, she wasn‚Äôt totally sure she was up to going through the hassle of voting. She figured the lines would be long, the wait would be awful, and the stress probably wouldn‚Äôt be worth it. But just when this 26-year-old woman was feeling too lazy to vote, something absolutely amazing happened‚Äîher ovaries burst out of her body and dragged her to the polling place. 
Amazing! Now THAT is how you rally on Election Day! 
Like so many Americans, Candice spent her morning lying in her bed, kicking herself for not having voted early, but as soon as it seemed like she‚Äôd go back to sleep, her fallopian tubes shot out of her abdomen, curled themselves around the side of her bed, and threw her to the floor. After dragging her body to her living room, her helpful ovaries crawled up to the doorknob and jostled the front door open. What started out as a lazy morning ended with her ovaries anchoring themselves to the floor and pulling the rest of her body to a polling place at nearby Jefferson Public School, where she dutifully filled out her ballot for President of the United States! 
If that‚Äôs not getting out the vote, we don‚Äôt know what is! It‚Äôs definitely easy to come up with a million excuses to avoid the polls, but once Candice‚Äôs ovaries had shot out of her body, they weren‚Äôt going to retract back inside until she had done her civic duty! 
While it might have been a bit of an inconvenience to spend the morning voting, no matter how much she tried to resist, Candice‚Äôs ovaries kept pulling and clawing at the floor, dragging her flailing body farther and farther until she arrived at a voting booth to cast her vote. Sure, she would rather have been sleeping, or at work, but three miles and several forceful tugs later, she was inside a voting booth and back on her feet, casting her ballot, and exercising her fundamental American right. 
Awesome. If you‚Äôre thinking of just staying inside, going to work, and skipping the polls altogether, it‚Äôs not too late to change your mind. Candice felt just like you once, but after being violently dragged by her ovaries to a polling station, she‚Äôs never felt better!";english;2016-11-09T01:21:03.736+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Inspiring: When This Woman Was Feeling Too Lazy To Vote, Her Ovaries Burst Out Of Her Body And Dragged Her To The Polling Place;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3446/8/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

The night appeared to be going smoothly in the network‚Äôs Washington studio, until King tried to zoom in on a breakdown map of crucial Ohio swing districts. When the map seemed to freeze up, a frustrated King tapped the Magic Wall with enough force that his whole arm plunged through the suddenly fluid surface of the screen. Before Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper could step in, he had been fully engulfed in a vast virtual expanse of colorful, swirling data. 
With millions of Americans tuning in to watch the results of this historic election, CNN has been forced to press on even as they try to free John King from the computerized map. A noticeably emotional Wolf Blitzer mouthed the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù to his imprisoned colleague before tapping the board to call up a gender breakdown of likely Oregon voters, the bar graph of which animated right into John King‚Äôs spine, launching nearly all the way to the mid-Atlantic states. If CNN producers thought that they had stabilized the situation by urging King to take refuge in the bottom corner of the screen, it did not take long for them to realize how wrong they were. When Connecticut was called for Hillary Clinton, the trapped John King was also turned entirely blue and let loose a horrible scream as if he were being burned alive. This level of panic was matched moments later when King tried to fend off a ravenous piece of malware with just his loafer, only for the shoe to shatter into pixels that the code devoured. 
Yikes. CNN will be wondering for a while how this all went so wrong, and on their biggest night, too. 
With plenty of states left to declare tonight, there‚Äôs still time for King to be rescued from the computerized nightmare. But with uploading a JPEG of a ladder for him to climb up and trying to shepherd him onto a thumb drive having already failed to return King to the studio, CNN may be running out of options. 
No matter how this shakes out, it‚Äôs clear CNN has a MAJOR technology fail on their hands. Then again, this is just what happens when anchors play with tech toys without reading the instructions. Well, better luck in 2020, guys.";english;2016-11-09T05:25:28.401+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Election Night Disaster: John King Tapped His Electoral College Map Too Hard And Fell Headfirst Into A Digital Hellscape;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3446/9/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Well, Donald Trump certainly has cause for celebration today. 
Despite having a multi-billion-dollar net worth, an international real estate company, and a primetime television show, Donald Trump‚Äôs ambitions were still set higher. The one trophy he‚Äôd spent his entire life trying to claim for his mantle of accomplishments had always evaded him‚Äîuntil today. By winning the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump is finally able to kick the nation‚Äôs most powerful black family out of their house. 
One can only imagine the immense joy Donald‚Äôs wife and children feel for him today. 
Trump has been preparing for this moment ever since the Trump Organization first started buying buildings throughout New York City and raising rent for African-Americans until he could toss them out for no longer being able to afford it. Now, after decades of practice and determination, the president-elect will see his magnum opus arrive in the form of booting the incredibly influential and powerful Obama family out of the home they‚Äôve lived in for the past eight years. 
Ejecting black people from their residences has been a lifelong passion for Donald. From practicing discriminatory housing policies that prevented black people from moving into Trump buildings to tagging black people‚Äôs rental applications with a separate sheet of paper marked ‚ÄúC‚Äù for ‚Äúcolored,‚Äù Donald has never lost focus on his goal. But that was all just warm-up for Trump, who clearly wanted to challenge himself by attempting to evict a wealthy black family of international renown. And when he sends President Obama, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and all their boxed-up belongings packing from their house in January, Trump will have done just that. 
What a truly stunning feat. With the biggest item on his bucket list now firmly checked off, Trump would be more than justified in resting on his laurels to soak in the consummation of all his dreams. It‚Äôs hard to imagine an even more powerful and famous black family Donald could evict, but knowing Trump, he will continue to push himself. Whatever his plans are now, the world will be watching in anxious anticipation.";english;2016-11-09T17:42:19.976+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Crowning Achievement: Donald Trump Has Just Accomplished His Lifelong Goal Of Kicking The Nation‚Äôs Most Powerful Black Family Out Of Their House;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3447/4/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Amazing! We should all strive to be as fearless as Samantha. 
When her alarm sounded this morning at 6 a.m., Samantha dug deep and did something unbelievable: Summoning all the willpower she had, she somehow found the strength inside herself to pull back her sheets and put two feet on the floor as if this were any other day! 
Samantha then headed straight into the shower, where she miraculously managed to shampoo her hair, turn off the water, and even get dressed for work before resolutely grabbing a granola bar as she headed out the door. 
Her remarkable heroism didn‚Äôt stop there. Defying all her basic instincts, Samantha was soon sitting on a bus while it drove in the direction of her office! Faced with a situation where other women might have given up, Samantha bravely stood up, pressed the button to request her stop, and even had the conviction to get off the bus when it came to a halt! 
This woman‚Äôs courage and determination should be an inspiration to us all. 
As if this story weren‚Äôt already inspiring enough, Samantha then went to all three of her morning meetings, battling through intermittent waves of nausea and behaving as if nothing at all had changed since last night. 
Incredible!

It‚Äôs no secret that workplaces in our country are still deeply misogynistic environments, but with her 2016 bid for the president of the United States, Hillary Clinton worked tirelessly to not just be elected but to also break down barriers for women everywhere. Today marks a big win for gender equality, because the glass ceiling has been shattered, and it is finally acceptable for women to cry at work! 
That‚Äôs right, ladies. It‚Äôs time to iron those pantsuits and put on those heels, because the day has finally come when it‚Äôs totally fine to sob openly in your office, and there‚Äôs nothing men can do to stop you! 
For far too long, women have been marginalized, written off, and told that there are certain things they can never achieve. But today, that all ends, because women are coming into work and crying at several unpredictable intervals throughout the entire day with absolutely zero negative consequences. As of now, it seems like anything is possible, because from the boardroom to the lab, women across the country are stepping up and owning their shit, skulking around their offices with puffy eyes and tears streaming down their faces, no ducking into the stairwell necessary. 
It‚Äôs 2016, baby, so if you have two X chromosomes, you better lean the hell in! This news has got us like: 
Considering that just a short while ago, most women were expected to be homemakers, it‚Äôs incredible to think that our nation has gotten to the point where not one, but all women can come to work and cry loudly in and around their workplaces, no questions asked. Just 100 years ago, women couldn‚Äôt even attend college, but now it is not only acceptable, but even expected that this morning, women went straight to the bathroom and cried uncontrollably out of anger or fear or downright despair! 
Y s, queen! 
Thankfully, today will go down as a huge victory for women, because we can show our daughters and our granddaughters that right now, it‚Äôs fine for their mothers to break down and spray a pool of mascara-soaked tears all over their desks.

Ever since 9-year-old Alexa Perry was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in March, life has been tough. Fortunately, someone amazing is looking out for her. When the CEO of Firestone Tires heard Alexa‚Äôs story, he surprised her by showing up at the hospital with dozens of exclusive photos of the company‚Äôs entire 2017 tire lineup. 
What an amazing gesture! 
The rest of us will have to wait until next July to see these tires, but thanks to the incredible generosity of Firestone CEO Gary Garfield, Alexa got a special advance peek on Tuesday. According to Alexa‚Äôs parents, Garfield entered the ward totally unannounced carrying a large briefcase containing what he called ‚Äúa glimpse of the future of American tires.‚Äù 
Garfield then had the hospital room cleared to make sure that the photos of Firestone‚Äôs tire offerings were for Alexa‚Äôs eyes only. Staying for a full hour despite his busy schedule, he was able to give Alexa detailed descriptions of the tread life, fuel efficiency, and all-weather performance for the full range of tires set to be released under the Firestone brand next year. 
‚ÄúAlexa has been incredibly brave and strong.

With protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high, American companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a Trump presidential election win. But one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the anti-Trump camp in a big way: Donald Trump will be added to Disney‚Äôs Hall Of Presidents, but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain. 
Wow. Disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in. Check out the press release they put out this morning: 
‚ÄúDisney prides itself on promoting inclusivity, empathy, and non-violence, which are values that Mr. Trump‚Äôs presidency threatens. That‚Äôs why when we eventually add him to our Hall Of Presidents exhibit in Disney World‚Äôs Magic Kingdom, his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly, and without limit. Being a company that caters to diverse families, we felt it was a moral responsibility to have Mr. Trump‚Äôs robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations, while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death. This is the best way for us to uphold the Hall Of Presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the Trump administration.‚Äù 
Given that Disney‚Äôs software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks, this company clearly wants people to know it‚Äôs not onboard the Trump train. 
Park visitors who feel similarly opposed to Trump‚Äôs presidency can rest assured that his Hall Of Presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety, so it‚Äôs always aware that more pain is coming. Although the machine will understand what joy is, its programming will never allow it to feel that. 
And Disney‚Äôs not letting Trump off the hook there. The replicas for Abraham Lincoln and George Washington will even be reprogrammed to slap, scratch, and pry the fingernails off the animatronic Trump, which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping, crying, screaming, vomiting, or a mix of all of these. 
If that doesn‚Äôt send a powerful statement about where Disney stands politically, we don‚Äôt know what does. 
It‚Äôs safe to say we won‚Äôt see the Trumps vacationing there anytime soon. Don‚Äôt share Disney‚Äôs disdain for a Trump presidency? You may be better off heading to Space Mountain instead of the Hall Of Presidents, because Disney has officially drawn the battle line right there.

Just follow these nine easy steps, and cremtine has never been easier. 1. Go running 
Cremtine is one of your body‚Äôs, um, most important neuro‚Ä¶ chemicals‚Ä¶ that regulates, uh, SEVERAL good benefits for‚Ä¶ being healthy‚Ä¶ according to leading research. When you go running or do other similar cardiovascular exercises, one positive‚Ä¶ reward‚Ä¶ that happens is that your brain ramps up its‚Ä¶ cremtine‚Ä¶ which, of course, leads to, er, positive results. 2. Take a power nap 
You hear that sound? That is the sound of your body saying‚Ä¶ thanks for the cremtine‚Ä¶ which is what it does after you take a power nap. The sleep synthesizes the cremtine, which in turn activates your‚Ä¶ molecules‚Ä¶ in your‚Ä¶ reward system. 3. Eat dark chocolate 
Well, ladies, can you even believe what is happening right now?!? Yes, this is your dream come to life. CHOCOLATE gives you CREMTINE due to its‚Ä¶ ingredients‚Ä¶ promoting the production of ‚Äúgood cremtine,‚Äù which, unlike the disease-causing ‚Äúbad cremtine,‚Äù is actually what is known as ‚Äúgood cremtine‚Äù‚Äîyes, believe it! So, please, go ahead and eat all of it‚Ä¶ we won‚Äôt tell if you won‚Äôt tell. Just say it‚Äôs for your cremtine number ;). 4. Antioxidants 
Of course, as the leading scientist has reported, antioxidants are among the PRIMARY building blocks for, er, nutrients, and when you have them‚Ä¶ your cremtine production soars and soars and soars and soars‚Ä¶ and then some. 5. Eat an avocado 
Avocados are extremely rich in‚Ä¶ toids‚Ä¶ and oils‚Ä¶ that according to many scientists from‚Ä¶ research university‚Ä¶ are HIGHLY EFFECTIVE at stimulating the cremitary gland, and this, as you know, as data tells us, is where cremtine happens. Moral of the story? Moderate consumption of an avocado is the one-way ticket to cremtine town! 6. Drink red wine 
As it has frequently been observed throughout scientists, cremtine deficiencies are frequently, er, linked to not having enough cremtine, according to the latest study. Yet did you also know that one of the most potent providers of‚Ä¶ vitamin-laden cremtine‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶ none other than red wine? ‚ÄúBut wait,‚Äù you may have screamed, ‚Äúdoctors have‚Ä¶ forbidden‚Ä¶ red wine.‚Äù But this, research has learned, is now‚Ä¶ false‚Ä¶ because high red wine consumption in moderation has, uh, been linked to high cremtine levels‚Ä¶ in your tissues. 7. Don‚Äôt drink red wine 
Oof! Well, this one, of course, is a no-brainer. Red wine, as infinite researchers are telling us, is, uh, one of THE leading benefactors of alcohol, which, guess what that means?‚Ä¶ It means that, in high concentrations of red wine, it has, uh, been WIDELY PROVEN‚Ä¶ to be TOXIC and ILLEGAL‚Ä¶ which, in even the smallest cups, will destroy‚Ä¶ yes, that is right‚Ä¶ cremtine . So next time‚Ä¶ when it is ‚Äúwine o‚Äô clock‚Äù‚Ä¶ maybe just stick to Barq‚Äôs root beer. Trust us‚Ä¶ your cremtine will thank you later. 8. Meditate 
Perhaps you have heard that meditation is RICH in good benefits‚Ä¶ but did you also know that it is also RICH in CREMtine? Say no more, because once you meditate for even two‚Ä¶ hours‚Ä¶ you will find that researchers have long associated this with the‚Ä¶ same compounds‚Ä¶ that give us cremtine. Sounds like a win-win-win! 9. Load up on gormium-B 
Is your blood‚Ä¶ thick‚Ä¶ from a lack of cremtine? Well‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt just stand there! Swallow a big dose of gormium-B, which, uh, according to authorities, is a tremendous... TREMENDOUS‚Ä¶ source of vital‚Ä¶ cremtine. All it takes is one‚Ä¶ quaff‚Ä¶ of this great nature supplement and your blood will become so, uh, WET and HOT with cremtine that you will be able to‚Ä¶ smell it. As the leading cremtine experts say, ‚ÄúGormium-B is key‚Ä¶ to cremtine.‚Äù THIS IS THE SECRET DOCTORS DON‚ÄôT WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT!";english;2016-11-14T21:18:42.416+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Life: 9 Easy Things You Can Do Every Day To Boost Your‚Ä¶ Uh‚Ä¶ Cremtine;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3463/9/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Eventually, the two of you drifted apart. Sometimes you wonder if your best friend still insists on all those rules, all these years later.

Life can be tough, but students at Willow Creek Elementary School in Duluth, Minnesota, have done something this year that will make you cry tears of joy: When they noticed that a fellow student wasn‚Äôt eating lunch at school, they brought him so many lunches that he clogged the door and school got canceled. 
Compassion for the win! 
When caring students saw that 9-year-old Bryce Oswald was showing up to school every day without a lunch, they knew they had to do something. They started giving Bryce fruit snacks and pats of butter from their lunches, and even pooled their allowances to buy Bryce hoagies and rotisserie chickens in an effort to make sure that he wouldn‚Äôt go hungry and would instead get massive enough to clog the door to the school and get school canceled. 
‚ÄúBryce didn‚Äôt have anything to eat, so we knew we had to help him out,‚Äù said Willow Creek student Kali Summers. ‚ÄúWe gave him our lunches every day, even if we got really hungry. We knew if he kept eating he would get fat enough to clog up the door and we wouldn‚Äôt have to go to school.‚Äù 
The plan worked perfectly. In a matter of months, Bryce went from having no lunch at all to having so many lunches that he packed on 115 pounds, got stuck in the door, and school got canceled. The students were so successful in plumping Bryce up that it took four firefighters with a jackhammer to finally be able to pry him out. 
Mission accomplished! 
Due to these kids‚Äô selfless dedication, not only did Bryce not go hungry, but all of the kids and teachers were able to stay home from school to play, watch TV, and relax instead of going to school for a full two days. They aren‚Äôt stopping there, either: Even though Bryce is now bigger than any other student in the district, the kids are going to continue to give him lunches in hopes that he can get stuck in the door so tightly that school gets canceled for a full week. 
Beautiful! Adults could learn a thing or two about kindness and commitment to your dreams from these remarkable kids.";english;2016-11-14T21:18:48.016+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Life: When These Third-Graders Saw Their Classmate Didn‚Äôt Have A Lunch, They Kept Feeding Him More And More Lunches Until He Clogged The Door And Got School Canceled;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3463/5/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;842;0;842;satire

The results of the 2016 election have left many women frightened for their futures in this country, but 29-year-old Vanessa Carp realizes that times of great upheaval call for decisive action: After realizing how dire the coming years could be for her, this quick-thinking young woman is scrambling to experience as much human dignity as possible before Donald Trump sets foot in the White House. 
Wow. Major props to Vanessa for getting herself prepared! 
With just a few short months before the president-elect comes to power, Vanessa has been taking herself out into the world every single day and soaking up as much human dignity as time permits. Whether she‚Äôs at home, at work, running errands, or even at the gym, Vanessa is seizing every chance to feel like a respected, autonomous human being before it all gets taken away from her on January 20. 
She now basks in the joy of visiting her doctor, unencumbered by the decisions others will soon make on her behalf. She relishes every interaction with her male coworkers while she still gets to feel like their peer. And she loves taking daily jogs around her neighborhood, savoring every last minute of the relative safety she temporarily still feels. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting down to the wire, but I‚Äôm just focused on hoarding as many normal human experiences as I can,‚Äù noted Vanessa, standing in the middle of her local grocery store and reveling in the feeling of having most of her civil rights intact. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many moments like these I‚Äôll get to have, so I figure I should stockpile some for the next four to eight years before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù 
Smart move, Vanessa! 
It‚Äôs unfortunate that women even have to think about things like this in 2016, but we commend Vanessa for taking necessary precautions.

No matter how you feel about zoos, this story will make you feel good. 
Zoo administrators are always experimenting with ways to make their animals‚Äô caged experiences as accommodating to their needs as possible, with varying degrees of success. But thanks to an innovative and humane new initiative, one of our most beloved institutions is setting a new standard for animal rights. The San Diego Zoo has taped telescopes to all of their animals‚Äô heads so that they can look at the planets. 
What a tremendous step forward! 
For decades, the San Diego Zoo led the way in terms of tourist attractions, but this latest move proves that they are even more committed to treating their animals with dignity. With a telescope affixed to each animal‚Äôs head, these incredible creatures can now gaze at the planets just by looking up. Visitors can take great comfort knowing that the ostriches, chinchillas, and all other animals are no longer limited to just looking at trees, dirt, or clouds, as they had been for so many heartbreaking years. 
According to president and CEO Douglas Myers, the project directly addresses a basic right of all animals. 
‚ÄúWhen you consider the challenges we face when improving animal captivity, strapping a telescope snugly to each animal‚Äôs head is a no-brainer,‚Äù said Myers. ‚ÄúThese are beautiful creatures that deserve to look at the planets.‚Äù 
Indeed, most zoo animals have never had the ability to take in the wonders of our galaxy, but in San Diego it‚Äôs now a key part of every animal‚Äôs care plan. At any moment, an otter can swivel his head and take a look at Saturn. A zebra can glance up from grazing to observe a sea of constellations seemingly close enough to lick. And when the park welcomed a new fox last month, tourists were able to watch as zoologists strapped a tiny telescope to his head, equipped with a polarized filter to protect his sensitive eyes. 
Wow! 
Well, if you needed another reason to finally visit the San Diego Zoo, you‚Äôve officially got it. Hopefully, this will encourage zoos everywhere to continue to explore new ways to address the welfare of their animals. Thankfully, they now have an excellent place to start.";english;2016-11-15T18:16:59.191+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Life: Animal Rights Win: The San Diego Zoo Has Taped Telescopes To All Of Their Animals‚Äô Heads So That They Can Look At The Planets;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3465/5/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;2;0;2;satire

Automation in the workplace can bring new levels of efficiency and employee happiness, but it can also mean that human workers lose their jobs in favor of robotic replacements. No matter your stance on cutting-edge technology in the office, there is no doubt that it‚Äôs a swiftly approaching reality. According to a new study released by Stanford University, Americans can expect over 50 percent of all workplace discrimination to be fully automated by 2040. 
The future is coming, and it‚Äôs coming fast. 
Thanks to recent advancements in computer intelligence and predictive analytics, it may not be long before you see an automated machine in your office demoting female employees for becoming pregnant. Whether humiliating subordinates with unwanted sexual comments or automatically filtering out r√©sum√©s from people with Middle Eastern last names, trends in technological development suggest that an increasingly computerized workforce will soon be enforcing inequality in office environments with far greater proficiency and cost-effectiveness than human labor. 
‚ÄúPeople think that automated workplace discrimination is still far off in the future, when truthfully it‚Äôs right around the corner,‚Äù said Stanford computer scientist Dr. Oliver Thorpe, who spearheaded the new study. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already at the point with facial recognition software where it can identify which genders and races should be passed up for leadership roles with far greater accuracy than humans, and technologies like this are only getting better and cheaper by the day.‚Äù 
With intelligent algorithms becoming rapidly more sophisticated and capable, virtually every industry can soon expect to begin replacing humans with machines that can oppress minorities, senior citizens, and other subjugated people groups with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. Within 10 years, market-available computers will have the ability to grossly neglect the needs of disabled workers and make them feel like burdens. Within 15 years, roving automatons will travel about open-plan offices smacking female subordinates‚Äô buttocks with their carbon-fiber paddle attachments, adeptly wielding their power in such a way as to avoid consequences. 
Some believe that machines will never be able to fully replicate the complexity and intuitiveness of human on-the-job prejudice, but employers will likely be willing to sacrifice that human touch for the sake of their bottom line. Thorpe notes that maintaining a fucked-up culture of occupational disparity is expensive, and as soon as companies realize that they can enlist semi-autonomous robots to mistreat their employees at a fraction of the cost, they‚Äôll be lining up to install them in offices nationwide. 
Only time will tell whether or not the human workers who have so dutifully carried out discriminatory business practices for decades get laid off or reassigned, but one thing is for sure: The American office is about to look way different.";english;2016-11-15T18:17:00.044+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Office Of The Future: Researchers Predict That Over 50 Percent Of Workplace Discrimination Will Be Automated By 2040;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3463/4/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;520;0;520;satire

We understood that these images were a bit crass and promised to remove them if Trump were to win the election, as a sign of respect for the office of the United States presidency. True to our word, we tried to take these pictures down as soon as Trump was elected, but unfortunately we haven‚Äôt been able to figure out how to delete this article from our website. Once content is published to our homepage, it seems to be stuck there. Though we cannot delete the bald Photoshops, we have been able to stretch out Donald Trump‚Äôs face all wide so that you can‚Äôt even tell he‚Äôs the one in the pictures. We hope this serves as an adequate temporary solution until we find a way to take these unbecoming images down completely. 1. At the current time, we are comfortable posting this picture with the caption ‚ÄúMy bald spot is absolutely yuge‚Äù alongside it, but should Trump assume the esteemed office of president in the fall, we would immediately remove it. 
We apologize that we weren‚Äôt able to remove this disrespectful picture of our president-elect completely, but we did what we could and stretched it out all wide. You can barely tell it‚Äôs Donald Trump. 2. Regardless of whatever political views you hold, it is disrespectful to show a picture of the commander-in-chief along with a caption like ‚ÄúSo this is what that pile of straw on his head is for.‚Äù 
We‚Äôre talking with our programmers now to figure out a way to delete these images from the web. Hopefully they will develop a method for doing so in the near future. In the meantime, we have preserved the dignity of President-elect Trump by stretching his face out and making his eyes huge. Nobody will be able to recognize that the man in this image is our new president. 3. Of course, it would still be fine to disagree with President Trump if you don‚Äôt support his policies. A healthy democracy allows dissent and debate. However, implying that the president wears a toupee when there is no evidence that he does is a crass breach of proper decorum. 
The presidency is the most hallowed office in our nation, and it is worthy of reverence and decorum at all times. Ideally, this image of Donald Trump‚Äôs toupee flying off in the wind would no longer be on our website. Since this is currently impossible, we‚Äôve used the magic of Photoshop to make his head very tall and thin. His identity is obscured. This bald man could be anybody. 4. No matter who is president, you address them as ‚ÄúSir,‚Äù not ‚ÄúDonald the Hutt.‚Äù We would quickly remove this if the American people choose Trump on November 8. 
This degrading Photoshop of President Trump‚Äôs face on Jabba the Hutt‚Äôs body is immature and degrading, and we‚Äôd remove it if we could. Since we currently don‚Äôt know how, we‚Äôve at least given him a tie to wear to imbue him with the poise and decorum the presidency confers on all who hold that hallowed office. 5. Comparing President Trump to Adolf Hitler would remain a valid political commentary, but making him bald in addition is completely uncalled for. If Donald Trump is elected, we promise to restore his normal hair to this image. 
Now that the American electorate has chosen Donald Trump to lead our nation, this image depicting him as a bald Adolf Hitler has become an unsubtle and tactless political statement that does not meet our exacting editorial standards. We‚Äôve given President-elect Trump his hair back in an effort to restore his dignity. 6. For now, let us enjoy this humorous Photoshop and its accompanying caption, ‚ÄúI am going to build a wig, and Mexico is going to pay for it.‚Äù During a Trump presidency, it would no longer have a place in the national discourse. 
All right, that‚Äôs all of them. We‚Äôve stretched out President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs face all wide so that nobody will know that he is the bald man in this picture. Hopefully, we‚Äôll find a way to remove these pictures from our website, but until then, this will have to do.";english;2016-11-15T19:23:15.331+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Life: We Don‚Äôt Know How To Take Down These Photoshops Of Bald Donald Trump, So We‚Äôve Stretched His Face Out All Wide So Nobody Can Recognize It‚Äôs Him;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3466/4/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

It looks like President-elect Donald Trump is wasting no time making his mark on Washington. He‚Äôs already gotten to work appointing his new Cabinet members and laying the groundwork for his new administration. And if it wasn‚Äôt already clear that things are going to be done Trump‚Äôs way for the next four years, Donald Trump just whispered ‚ÄúHope you like to make ham, motherfucker‚Äù to a White House executive chef. 
Wow! It looks like Washington is going to be a very different place under President Trump! 
Those who witnessed the encounter say that, during a recent visit to the White House, Trump caught sight of a high-ranking member of the White House kitchen, waved him over, and said, ‚ÄúCome here, let me talk to you a minute,‚Äù in a voice that was somehow both cordial and threatening. When the chef got close to Trump, the president-elect shook his hand, pulled him close, and began whispering that once he got sworn in, the chef would be doing nothing but cooking him ham 24/7. 
Members of the White House staff overheard the phrases ‚ÄúHam is your life now, idiot‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what else you can cook. I only want ham‚Äù as Trump whispered to the chef, whose eyes grew wide with silent fear as he listened to what our nation‚Äôs newest president was telling him. They also say that Trump briefly smiled to wave to photographers before turning back to the chef with a dark and menacing expression on his face to continue whispering about ham. 
Now that‚Äôs the sign of a president who isn‚Äôt afraid to shake things up! 
While many Americans are deeply troubled by the bigoted rhetoric of Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign, those who voted for him as a protest against the political establishment have got to be pretty happy about a story like this one! No other president would grab a White House chef by the hand and whisper, ‚ÄúYou live in Ham World now, motherfucker!‚Äù 
And it seems as if President-elect Trump has a concrete plan in place, as well! Trump didn‚Äôt just tell the White House chef that he wanted ham in general; he had specific types of ham that he wanted, including ‚Äúbaked ham,‚Äù ‚Äúsmoked ham all the time,‚Äù and ‚Äúham with frosting.‚Äù Trump was also overheard telling the White House chef, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre also going to be making something called a Pork Jackhammer, which I just invented during the limo ride over here. It‚Äôs incredibly dangerous to make, and I want to eat it every day.‚Äù 
It definitely looks like this is going to be a new era in Washington! You just know it‚Äôs not going to be business as usual in D.C. anymore when Donald Trump isn‚Äôt afraid to look a White House chef right in the eye and say, ‚ÄúWhen I ask for Chinese food, that just means soy sauce on ham. When I ask for sushi, that‚Äôs raw ham. President Trump will be eating barges of ham for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The moment I take the oath of office is the moment that your world becomes a pork-fueled hellscape.‚Äù 
People who voted for Trump wanted a maverick, and it looks like they got one! 
After about two minutes of whispering ham-related threats, Trump stepped away from the chef and began smiling and waving at the surrounding press as if nothing had happened, but his message was clear: When Donald Trump becomes president, he‚Äôs going to play by his own rules, and he‚Äôs only going to eat ham! If President Trump has his way, life in the White House might become completely unrecognizable!";english;2016-11-15T21:05:03.756+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: A New Era: Donald Trump Just Whispered ‚ÄòHope You Like To Make Ham, Motherfucker‚Äô To A White House Chef;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3466/5/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration may be months from now, but it looks like his Oval Office transition is already well under way. In addition to naming Reince Priebus his chief of staff and meeting with advisors on policy issues, Trump had to schedule in some time this week to go around to houses in the White House‚Äôs neighborhood and inform residents that he‚Äôs moving in down the street. 
Looks like Trump is not wasting any time preparing for his big move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.‚ÄúHello, my name is Donald Trump, and as a new resident in this community, I am required to inform you that I have a history of sexually assaulting women,‚Äù said the president-elect while standing on one of his new neighbor‚Äôs doorsteps. ‚ÄúIn the past, I have grabbed women inappropriately, made multiple unwanted advances toward women, and harassed women with vulgar and inflammatory language. For this reason, I have to go door to door telling residents of my new presence in the neighborhood. Sorry to bother you, and have a nice day.‚Äù 
After spending most of Tuesday exploring potential cabinet picks, Trump was later spotted going around the White House‚Äôs neighborhood and knocking on doors, continuing to alert his new neighbors to his history of sexual assault. Standing awkwardly on front porches and avoiding eye contact, Trump promised local residents that he wouldn‚Äôt cause any trouble for them or their families and planned to mostly keep to himself for the next four years as president of the United States. He then finished the day by meeting with several economic advisors. 
It‚Äôll be interesting to see what a Trump presidency might look like as he spends the next few days crafting policy goals and reassuring his new neighbors that his motorcade will take alternate routes to ensure that he is never within a hundred yards of a school. If he keeps making the rounds at this pace, it won‚Äôt be long before all of the residents of Pennsylvania Avenue have been made aware of his record of sexual assault. 
President Obama still has a few more months left in the White House, but pretty soon Trump will be moving in. So far, the president-elect seems determined to make that transition as smooth as possible for him, his fellow Republicans, and the local residents whom he has been individually informing of his status as a sexual predator.";english;2016-11-16T22:46:52.808+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: First Steps: Donald Trump Has To Go Around The White House‚Äôs Neighborhood Letting Residents Know He Is Moving In Down The Street;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3467/5/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Get ready for the most cringeworthy story you‚Äôre going to read all day. 
Panasonic might be one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, but after today, they may find themselves struggling to stay afloat. The company‚Äôs president has been forced to resign in disgrace after 60,000 Panasonic TVs abruptly ascended to heaven without warning. 
We‚Äôll give you a minute to finish shaking your head. 
The scandal broke early last night when 60,000 of the company‚Äôs popular DX802-model flat-screen TVs from all over the world silently lifted off of the ground and, despite their owners yelling at them to stop and trying to drag them back down to Earth, floated away from the mortal realm and into the kingdom of heaven to reside with the immortal seraphim for all eternity. 
Yikes. Needless to say, Panasonic customers are not happy! Only a few minutes after the televisions began their skyward journey to the kingdom of God, Panasonic found themselves completely inundated with tweets like this: 
Wow. Panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one! Chances are, when you‚Äôre trying to stay competitive as one of the world‚Äôs foremost electronics companies, the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise. 
We‚Äôve got to give credit where credit is due: At least Panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down. The company has issued a public apology, and in a drastic move, the president of the company, Kazuhiro Tsuga, chose to resign in the wake of this scandal. Speaking at a press conference this morning, Tsuga issued the following statement: 
‚ÄúAfter much consideration, I have chosen to step down as the president of Panasonic Corp. If I could, I would travel to Heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions. I would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these TVs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal Panasonic customers on Earth. Even if I saw God sitting on one of our missing DX802 flat-screens, I would shove the Lord off of the TV so that I could retrieve it for our customers. Unfortunately, I do not have the power to travel to Heaven, and so I am left with no choice but to resign my position.‚Äù 
Tsuga‚Äôs resignation is a nice gesture, but it doesn‚Äôt bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven. Panasonic‚Äôs reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen. 
It‚Äôs always an embarrassing moment when a high-powered executive suffers a scandal that forces him or her to resign, but it looks like yet another head honcho is about to step into that humiliating spotlight: After nearly a decade on the job, the CEO of beans has officially stepped down following reports that there cannot be a CEO of beans. 
Yikes. Talk about a fall from grace. 
Patrick Buckley was an ambitious leader as the CEO of beans, often telling people that he was in charge of every single bean that came out of the dirt, and even going so far as to print up business cards with ‚ÄúCEO of beans‚Äù listed right on the front. With beans being such a common staple of diets worldwide, a man in Mr. Buckley‚Äôs position may have seemed poised to become one of the most powerful people in the food industry. But in the blink of an eye, everything the executive had been working for came crashing down before him, as reports began to circulate late last week that while bean manufacturers may have CEOs, it‚Äôs impossible for beans in general to have a CEO of their own. 
‚ÄúAfter a wonderful career at the helm of beans, it has become apparent that there is no such thing as my job,‚Äù the scandalized CEO wrote in a brief statement to the press. ‚ÄúIn light of this news that my position, and my former role as director of garbanzo, do not exist, it seems prudent that I step down immediately. I am proud of the work I have done for beans during my tenure, and I look forward to continuing to prepare and eat beans in the future.‚Äù 
As of this morning, the board of directors of beans has accepted Mr. Buckley‚Äôs resignation, and then the members promptly stepped down themselves amidst reports that beans cannot have a board of directors, either. 
Making matters worse, the entire corporate structure of beans now finds itself crumbling from the top all the way down, as an onslaught of new allegations indicate that beans, as a relatively loose category of foods, has never been and cannot be a staffable organization. 
Wow. It‚Äôs hard to imagine how Mr. Buckley will ever bounce back from such a disgrace, but hopefully he learns an important lesson from all this. CEOs, take note: Your mistakes will always come back to haunt you.";english;2016-11-17T09:35:12.758+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Disgrace: The CEO Of Beans Has Stepped Down Amid Reports That There Can‚Äôt Be A CEO Of Beans;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3469/6/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;20;0;20;satire

If his campaign is any indication, Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency will usher in drastic, regressive changes to immigration, health care, and women‚Äôs rights in America. In response, Angela Bubash, a woman who appears to be slightly misinformed about just what is likely to happen, is rushing to stockpile enough deodorant to last her the next four years. 
Well, it seems like some wires got crossed somewhere, but okay! Way to take action, Angela! 
In the days since Trump‚Äôs victory, she‚Äôs cleaned out the deodorant inventories of multiple Omaha-area grocery stores, apparently under the impression that deodorant will soon become much more difficult to acquire than it is now. With the prospect of a menacing new world looming, Angela is taking some seemingly misguided precautions and buying up all the stick, gel, roll-on, and spray deodorant she can ahead of Trump‚Äôs inauguration ceremony on January 20. 
For whatever reason, Angela is also taking to Facebook to encourage her peers to follow suit in stashing away lots of deodorant as soon as possible: 
Wow. It‚Äôs unclear how she came to the well-meaning but mistaken conclusion that it was necessary to hoard hundreds of dollars‚Äô worth of deodorant in preparation for Trump‚Äôs first term, but it‚Äôs hard not to be impressed by how much deodorant Angela has amassed in the past few days! 
Even if she‚Äôs a little off base here, Angela is showing the importance of not being complacent in the face of tyranny, and we think that‚Äôs awesome. Stay strong, Angela.

Most of them left. Here are the ones who are still sticking around. 1. The Guy Who Bought My Lamp 
I expected the guy who bought my lamp to leave after he bought my lamp. But he did not leave. He sat down on my lawn and started reading the newspaper. I went up to him and asked him if he needed help with anything, and he said, ‚ÄúNope. Been saving my appetite all day.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really know what that meant, but someone had a question about my foosball table at that moment so I didn‚Äôt have time to get clarification on that. 2. The Couple Who Didn‚Äôt Buy Anything But Spent A Lot Of Time Browsing My Box Of National Geographic sAnd Then Got In Their Car And Took A Nap 
These people seemed really into my National Geographic s, so I was pretty surprised when they decided not to buy them. I was also surprised when, instead of leaving, they just got in their car and started napping. They‚Äôre still asleep, and there‚Äôs a little Post-it on their window that says, ‚ÄúWake us up when it‚Äôs ready.‚Äù 3. The Old Woman Who Bought My Vacuum 
When the old lady who bought my vacuum offered to pay for my vacuum by vacuuming my house, I thought it was a little odd but also kind of nice. My place is a little dusty these days, and definitely could use a good vacuuming. So I said yes. I wish that she had left after she finished vacuuming my house. She is now in the kitchen and has been vacuuming the same corner for the last 20 minutes. Plus, she keeps chiming in on how to make the pasta sauce. I have to admit she did a pretty good job cleaning my house, though. I don‚Äôt know how to ask her to leave without sounding rude. 4. The Lady Who Bought A Plate, A Fork, And A Knife 
I assumed this woman bought these items for her own home, but it‚Äôs been three hours and she is just standing by the front door sneaking peeks at the kitchen through the window. This is becoming stressful. 5. The Kid Who Bought My Toaster Even Though I Told Him It Was Broken And Then Handed Me A List Of His Allergies 
When this kid asked me how much I wanted for the toaster, I was up-front about the fact that it was broken. But that didn‚Äôt matter to him. He bought the thing for 50 cents and then handed me a list of allergies he had. Now he is sitting out on the lawn along with the guy who bought my lamp, and I think they‚Äôre working on a crossword puzzle together. I really don‚Äôt think I have enough ingredients to make food for all these people. Also, there are a lot of allergies on this list. 6. The Older Gentleman Who Brought A Raw Steak To My Garage Sale And Then Bought A Coatrack 
I don‚Äôt know why the old man who bought the coatrack brought a raw steak to my garage sale. After he purchased the coatrack, he placed the raw steak in a dish to marinate, then put it in my garage fridge. I asked him what he was doing, and he said, ‚ÄúGotta marinate this bad boy for dos horas, compadre. Buon appetito.‚Äù He is still here, and his steak is still marinating. Overall, I‚Äôd say the garage sale itself was a success because I made about $250.

The cruelty of factory farms is a daily nightmare for billions of animals, but that might soon start to change thanks to a forward-thinking initiative by one of the biggest names in the meat industry. In a humane act of compassion for their livestock, the Oscar Mayer Company now requires its pork suppliers to give their pigs one thrilling sexual experience before sending them to slaughter. 
It‚Äôs pretty difficult to overstate what a huge leap forward this is for animal rights. 
The details of the new policy are extremely promising: Once a pig reaches sexual maturity, factory workers must lather it in a warming lubricant and place it in an outdoor pen, where it will encounter dozens of sows in heat and boars specially bred to produce voluptuously potent pheromone levels. The pigs will then be encouraged to partake in any variety of sow-on-boar, sow-on-sow, boar-on-boar, or autoerotic swineplay they prefer. Only after they‚Äôve bellowed long, guttural squeals of satisfaction will these pigs be killed, processed, and separated into their desirable parts for human consumption. 
Conscious consumers can rest assured: Oscar Mayer pork will have been treated to full prostate and teat stimulation via double-prodded toys, clamps, and strategically placed ice cubes before being sent to the slaughterhouse. Farmers will even have to install sprinklers emitting warm hog urine for any pig who might be into that. 
Wow. It seems like Oscar Mayer is truly dedicated to setting a new bar for ethical animal treatment. 
To put this in perspective, not even free-range operations keep pig behavior specialists on-site to spot hogs nearing ejaculation and pull them away in order to temporarily evade orgasm, thereby extending the hog‚Äôs arousal and making their eventual climaxes that much more explosive. For a household meat brand like Oscar Mayer to endorse this kind of practice is a really, really big deal. 
‚ÄúBefore slaughter, we intend to treat our pigs to nothing less than the absolute highest order of hoof-shattering orgasms,‚Äù said Oscar Mayer President Mark Magnesen in a press release. ‚ÄúOur commitment to the well-being of animals means ensuring that no pig reaches an abbatoir without first experiencing a flesh romp so sensational it causes their numbing limbs to buckle under full-bodied tail-to-snout pleasure.‚Äù 
Just yes. Even PETA has to admit that this is a great new direction for pork producers. 
Taste tests held by the company revealed that customers unanimously preferred meat from sexually gratified pigs over meat from pigs raised under typical factory-farm stresses. Interested in trying some yourself, or just want to support the cause? Look for the special label they‚Äôve created to specify that their products came from a pig they made squeal in wanton rapture. 
Well, it looks like Oscar Mayer is finally getting on the right side of animal rights history. This is exactly the thoughtful kind of action consumers want to see food companies enact. They could have easily just asked suppliers to masturbate a few pigs to completion and called it change, but the level of care they‚Äôre pouring into these bacchanalian thrills shows that they‚Äôre truly making animal welfare a priority. 
Any progress for farm animals is welcome progress, and hopefully this is a sign of even better living conditions to come. One blowout circus of carnal delights is the least they can do for these pigs.";english;2016-11-18T20:10:25.886+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;News: Animal Welfare FTW!

Why not brush up on these apple-picking rules so you don‚Äôt end up in the Punishment Orchard? 
1. Don‚Äôt climb the trees: Apple trees are for picking, not climbing! Fail to heed this rule and you might just find yourself stuck in the cruel autumn shadow of the Punishment Orchard. Swinging from a tree branch in the regular orchard won‚Äôt seem worth it once you‚Äôre lashed to a hayride and dumped in the middle of this sprawling, 100-acre wasteland where the fog never lifts and the apples are all way too hot to pick. 
2. Twist, don‚Äôt pull: Heads up: Pulling an apple can inadvertently knock down other fruit and risks damaging the tree. Better to carefully twist the apple upwards than be consigned to the Punishment Orchard‚Äôs sea of wet, beige trees with no end in sight. Keep this rule in mind and you will never get trapped in the pitch-black sap oozing out of all the trees, nor will you be driven mad by the winds that constantly whisper a summary of Dale Earnhardt‚Äôs death. 
3. Don‚Äôt waste fruit: The stench of bleach and pennies will be the surefire sign that your decision to just toss imperfect apples onto the ground of the normal orchard has landed you in the wicked, seething grove of the Punishment Orchard. A chorus of middle-aged men shrouded by crude scarecrow masks will taunt you with their vexing rhyme: ‚ÄúWe are the men who have picked before / Your hands are bags, your days no more.‚Äù Looking down, condemned travelers will realize the infectious verse has replaced their hands with reusable grocery bags and they can no longer remember important birthdays. 
4. Don‚Äôt eat the apples until you‚Äôve paid: You‚Äôll want to pay up-front if you don‚Äôt want to wake up in the wicker prison at the base of the Tree of Despair, a beige monstrosity whose sprawling tendrils lie directly under the approach path of the regional airport. You must sit in your atonement basket while the depraved, orphaned children of the Punishment Orchard throw scalding apples at your head as part of one of their simple-minded religious rituals. 
5. Don‚Äôt pick outside the designated areas: Follow the clearly posted signs in sunny and cheerful normal orchard and you should be fine! Wanderers will have their names recorded on the Punishment Orchard‚Äôs Ledger of Bad Deeds, a shameful blight that nearly cost William Rehnquist his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1971. Then they will be given incorrect directions which will only send them deeper into the bowels of the Punishment Orchard, where the Cider Warden bathes himself in bleach and spare change. Even years after a stay in the Punishment Orchard, the smell of either of these items will send you into a vivid Vietnam flashback, regardless of whether or not you fought in Vietnam. 
6. No running: It‚Äôs natural to let the excitement of apple picking get the best of you. Just don‚Äôt be surprised if you draw the ire of the Punishment Picker. Setting aside his chisel and cigar, he will take an afternoon off from making sculptures of Mussolini having a great time in order to make a sculpture of you getting stung by a bee. Your cries of remorse will be drowned out by the children of the Punishment Orchard cheering ‚ÄúGather your coins, friends! The Punishment Man of the forest has taken a day off of sculpting a happy Mussolini in order to immortalize a delinquent being humiliated by a bee!‚Äù

Get ready for the most heartwarming story you‚Äôll read all day. 
If you met Paul Langdon or Ayesha Qamar on the street, you might think they have nothing in common. Paul is a retired firefighter, Ayesha is a law student. Paul has lived in the same suburb of Columbus for his entire life, Ayesha immigrated to Ohio from Pakistan when she was a teen. Paul is a devout Christian, Ayesha is Muslim. But if you dig a little deeper, you‚Äôll find that they share a common bond: Both Paul and Ayesha have ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô painted on their garages! 
Beautiful! Take a look at the side-by-side pictures above to see just how similar these two really are. 
When Donald Trump announced his campaign last summer, Paul knew he wanted to show his support by painting a large sign of the candidate‚Äôs name on his garage door. But Paul probably never would have guessed that one year later, just a few towns over from him, Ayesha‚Äôs own garage would be painted with literally the exact same word! Paul and Ayesha may be from totally different walks of life, but when it comes to the name currently painted on their garages, these two have more in common than they ever could have imagined. 
At the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether their skin is white or brown. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether they worship God or Allah. And it doesn‚Äôt matter whether the word ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô has been carefully lettered or hastily scrawled across the garage in brusque spray paint. All that matters is the commonality they share in having the word ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô painted on their homes for the entire neighborhood to see. 
Amazing! It just goes to show, you should never judge a book by its cover. 
At a time when our country feels so divided, stories like this one give us hope for humanity. On the surface, Paul and Ayesha couldn‚Äôt be more different, but the messages painted or spray-painted across their garages are one in the same.

As a parent, you always have to be aware of what lessons your child is learning from the world around him or her. I know that I won‚Äôt be able to protect my 9-year-old James from every bad thing out there, but on a recent trip to the grocery store, I was utterly appalled by a disturbing trend: Our country has become desensitized to violence in hot-sauce names, and it‚Äôs a big problem. 
You can‚Äôt walk down your grocer‚Äôs sauce isle without being bombarded by hot-sauce names that romanticize violence. Tears of Blood, Nuclear Bombardment Chile Extract, and Death on the Toilet have become standard fare in the hot-sauce industry. An innocent trip to purchase a simple bottle of ketchup now subliminally exposes shoppers, and our impressionable children, to dozens of gruesome descriptions of burning flesh, brutal deaths, and massive ass damage. 
As soon as the hot-sauce industry agreed it was okay to allow names like Cremation in a Bottle Pepper Sauce and Ass Grave Cajun Sauce to appear on store shelves, any shred of decency went out the window. An arms race began to see who could come up with the most violent and gory sauce name, society be damned. And it needs to stop before our children internalize these sorts of brutal names as the norm for hot-sauce labels. 
Hot sauce has always been hot, but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today. 
I took my son James to my favorite Mexican restaurant this past weekend, and he didn‚Äôt even blink when he saw a bottle with ‚ÄúVolcanic Crucification‚Äù written out in flames. If he isn‚Äôt bothered by this, who‚Äôs to say if he would even think twice if he one day saw a hot sauce called Ghost Pepper Throat Thresher? 
I pray that we correct course in this country before anyone decides to make that hot sauce. 
It wasn‚Äôt always like this. Hot sauce has always been hot, but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today. Names like Frank‚Äôs Red Hot let you know you were in for some serious heat, but left something to the imagination. But there is no longer a moral standard for hot-sauce names. Now, all it takes to begin leading a child down a bad path is for them to glance at a sauce bottle in a friend‚Äôs refrigerator door. 
Whether it‚Äôs Screaming Suicide Moruga Scorpion Sauce or Habanero Holocaust Sauce, the lengths to which today‚Äôs sauces are going to outdo one another with disturbingly violent names has gotten out of control. And if you‚Äôre a parent, you know that we must do something to stop this, before it‚Äôs too late for our children.";english;2016-11-22T05:16:37.494+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Blog: Our Country Has Become Worryingly Desensitized To Violence In Hot-Sauce Names;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3473/5/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;satire

Prepare to have your breath taken away by Dr. Goodall‚Äôs words. 
1. Chimps will betray their own to get their hands on Italian food: ‚ÄúAs with all chimps, the ones I studied in Gombe were absolutely obsessed with Italian food and would go to extraordinary lengths to get their hands on some. One day, the troop‚Äôs alpha male, whom I called Goliath, managed to acquire a plate of linguine. Humphrey, a younger male, saw Goliath‚Äôs linguine and became incredibly jealous. He offered to give Goliath his most prized possession‚Äîa vacant hornet nest that he enjoyed having sex with‚Äîin exchange for the linguine, but Goliath declined, as he already had a hornet nest of his own. Desperate to eat the linguine, Humphrey threw some pebbles to divert Goliath‚Äôs attention, then snuck up behind him and ripped his head off, allowing him to take the Italian food from his superior. It was a gruesome yet utterly fascinating scene.‚Äù 
2. When chimpanzee communities encounter a Japanese researcher, they will try to put them in jail: ‚ÄúMy colleague, Dr. Kiyoshi Yamamoto, discovered this when chimps dragged him from his tent in the middle of the night down to the local prison. The apes would then approach the town‚Äôs sheriff with their hands out, expecting a food reward. It was truly shocking to learn that chimpanzees are capable of such things. Nature is not always pretty.‚Äù 
3. Most chimps can vocalize the phrase ‚Äúoh no‚Äù: ‚ÄúThey like to yell it while they defecate.‚Äù 4. Chimps don‚Äôt like it when you blow up one of their family members with a grenade: ‚ÄúOne of my young researchers, Sofia Manfredi, discovered this after rolling an active grenade into a ditch where several male siblings were sharing a lunch of termites and soup. The grenade exploded the youngest one into a red mist of viscera and bone, and, curiously, the other brothers seemed to become rather disheartened.‚Äù 
5. Chimps revere hippos: ‚ÄúWhen they become aware of a hippo in the vicinity, chimps stop whatever they‚Äôre doing and take turns honoring the beast. They bring offerings of plump salamanders, crushed soda cans, and other treasures they‚Äôve found in the dirt, and they join together in an angelic chorus of growls to soothe the hippo. New mothers will rub their infants against the hippo‚Äôs groin to bless them with his virility. The troop‚Äôs elders will break off their incisors with a rock and fashion a crude crown of teeth for the hippo to wear. If the hippo becomes aggressive towards them, they do not resist; in fact, it is an honor for them to be crushed by the hippo, and they will often place their heads on the ground next to his hooves in hopes that he might accidentally stomp their skulls flat.‚Äù 
6. If a chimp dunks its head into a bucket of horchata for an hour, it will die: ‚ÄúWhenever chimps discover a large pail of horchata in the forest, the eldest female of the group will approach it and slowly lower her head into the liquid, remaining there for an hour or more until another chimp yanks her out of it. It was fascinating to observe the way their social structure altered afterwards, with the next eldest female unfailingly rising up to lead the group‚Äôs children in licking the sweet rice milk from their deceased matriarch‚Äôs body.‚Äù";english;2016-11-22T05:16:39.972+02:00;clickhole.com;US;16425.0;Life: After 55 Years Of Research, Jane Goodall Shares Her 6 Most Fascinating Discoveries About Chimpanzees;0.0;http://images.onionstatic.com/clickhole/3473/2/16x9/1200.jpg;0;0;297;0;297;satire

A flash mob of over 150 blacks teens assaulted numerous people on Friday in Philadelphia in an attack that appears to have been racially motivated, and yet the media is silent about this possible motivation. 
LifeZette reports that the racial component of the attack was evident in a Facebook post written by Joe Lauletta , whose daughter, Christina, was attacked by the flash mob on Friday. Lauletta wrote that he received a phone call from Christina, who tearfully explained that she ""was jumped"" and ""beat up pretty bad."" 
""I find out that her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 30-40 black teenagers on their way home from the Temple football game,"" Lauletta wrote. ""This happened after they got off the subway at Broad and Cecil B Moore. These sick animals held her down and kicked and stomped on her repeatedly. Thank god, the people from the pizza place intervened."" 
While no bones were broken, Christina was ""badly bruised"" throughout her body, Lauletta said ""it makes me cry just thinking about it."" 
Lauletta's post seemed to indicate the racial aspect of the attack, and on Tuesday he posted on Facebook that ""the FBI is investigating"" and ""are analyzing all video coverage,"" signaling that the FBI is looking into the attack as a hate crime. 
In an interview with the New York Post , Lauletta wouldn't explicitly say the attack was racially motivated but sort of implied it: 
‚ÄúWell, I haven‚Äôt been saying that because everybody is trying to get me to say it and I don‚Äôt know if I want to be that person,‚Äù Lauletta told The Post. ‚ÄúEveryone can draw their own conclusions.‚Äù 
Lauletta said the possibility of the attacks being motivated by race ‚Äì perhaps as a sort of gang initiation ‚Äì was part of the reason why his story was shared so frequently and as far away as Africa. 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it spread so fast,‚Äù Lauletta said. ‚ÄúIf you read my Facebook page, everybody‚Äôs saying it.‚Äù 
However, Philadelphia Police Lt. John Stanford insisted to the Post that ""there hasn‚Äôt been any indication that race is involved in this in any shape or form."" 
Even still, the media hasn't reported that the attack is possibly a hate crime, as LifeZette points out: 
Friday violence as teen mob attacks Temple students, police; four arrested,‚Äù read the headline on Philly.com, while the Philly Voice reported ‚ÄúTeens arrested after flash mob leads to assaults on Broad Street.‚Äù The Associated Press headline read: ‚ÄúSTUDENTS BEATEN, HORSE PUNCHED IN MOB ATTACKS AT UNIVERSITY. 
The Washington Post buried the possibility in their story and then dismissed it with Stanford's quote. 
LifeZette also noted that Temple University described the attack as ""a large group of approximately 200 juveniles causing disruption along Broad Street."" 
Maybe Stanford is correct that it was a random attack, or maybe the black flash mob was targeting whites. But there is no doubting the media's hypocrisy: if this were a flash mob of white teenagers that attacked blacks, the media would be screaming about it being a hate crime. But since the incident in Philadelphia does not advance the media's racial narrative, they will not treat it in the same manner.

On Saturday, former president George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush celebrated their 70th birthdays together in Crawford, Texas. 
President Bush‚Äôs birthday was July 6, and Laura‚Äôs is on November 4. 
Some of the attendees included former commerce secretary Donald Evans, Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones, and Ross Perot Jr., the son of H. Ross Perot. George Strait performed, and sang ‚ÄúHappy Birthday,‚Äù per People. Typical of Bush‚Äôs down-home style, he wore jeans, a western-style shirt and a prominent belt buckle. 
The dinner included an avocado and grapefruit salad, Mesquite smoked peppered beef tenderloin, Southern fried catfish, roasted corn and poblano pudding, bourbon carrots, and cheddar and black pepper biscuits. The dessert was a Texas chocolate sheet cake. 
Bush also invited guests to his art studio at the ranch, dubbed Studio 43, where he works on his paintings. 
Laura Bush was working as a librarian in the Austin Independent School District when she met George in 1977; their friends Joe and Jan O'Neill invited them to a barbecue. They were married in November 1977 at the First United Methodist Church in Midland, where she had been baptized. She wore a tan, two-toned dress she had bought off the rack. 
George W. Bush later called his proposal to his wife the ""best decision of my life."" Laura, an only child, said she gained ""brothers and sisters and wonderful in-laws"" and made her feel part of the family.

Remington Research's summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become ""increasingly competitive"": 
Last week, we found a presidential race where Hillary Clinton held a clear advantage. This week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go. Trump appears to be holding strong in his must-win states and Colorado remains within the margin of error. The data also show that Pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category. 
‚ÄúThe presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch. Hillary maintains an advantage leading in Colorado and Pennsylvania, but at this point anything can happen,‚Äù said Titus Bond, Director of Remington Research Group 
Other state polling data came out on Sunday that also showed a close-race between Trump and Clinton, although the polls were surveyed before FBI director James Comey's announcement that they were re-opening their investigation against Clinton . Via RealClearPolitics : Florida: New York Times/Siena: Trump 46 percent, Clinton 42 percent. NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 45 percent, Trump 44 percent. Gravis: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 47 percent. Colorado: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 42 percent, Trump 39 percent. Arizona: CBS/YouGov: Trump 44 percent, Clinton 42 percent. North Carolina: NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 47 percent, Trump 41 percent. Gravis: Clinton 49 percent, Trump 47 percent. CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 45 percent. Pennsylvania: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 40 percent. 
The fact that some of these polls were close even before the Comey announcement led to this observation from FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver: Both things can be true: 1) Comey impact overblown ‚Äî Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 31, 2016 
Radio host Steve Deace writes at Conservative Review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton, the renewed FBI investigation could ""have a potentially huge impact"" on Election Day: 
Trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Indiana, and Alaska that rarely go blue on Election Day. It‚Äôs quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the Clintons could sway the bulk of Republican-leaning undecideds Trump‚Äôs way. But that‚Äôs provided, of course, that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as he‚Äôs been prone to do. Then there‚Äôs the matter of Trump‚Äôs emerging Evan McMullin headache in Utah. 
If Trump can be disciplined this final week, his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on Iowa, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina. Those five states would get him within striking distance to 265 Electoral College votes, and then you hope you can pull an upset in Colorado, Pennsylvania, or New Mexico where Trump is visiting during the campaign‚Äôs final week. The hope is that there‚Äôs enough voters in those states wearier of Clinton‚Äôs corruption than worried about whether Trump‚Äôs fit for office. 
FiveThirtyEight currently has Trump's odds of winning the presidency at 23.6 percent in their polls-plus forecast. This week will be crucial for Trump in increasing those odds, and maybe the FBI's re-opened investigation into Clinton will help improve those odds as it becomes closer to Election Day.

Abedin is perhaps Hillary Clinton‚Äôs closest confidante. During the course of the FBI‚Äôs investigation, she spoke with federal agents on several occasions, evading questions and providing only vague answers to direct inquiries. ‚ÄúThe process has begun,‚Äù stated the bureau Sunday in a rather cryptic message, suggesting that Abedin‚Äôs emails will be possibly be examined before election day. Enjoying intimate access to the former secretary of state, Abedin sent several emails through Hillary‚Äôs private server. A few months ago, the FBI explicitly asked Abedin to hand over any information, including emails and devices those emails may be stored in to investigators. It now looks like she failed to comply with the request. In a bizarre twist of events, the FBI found hundreds of thousands of Abedin‚Äôs emails stored on a laptop belonging to her now-estranged husband. The emails were discovered as investigators seized evidence related to a separate investigation regarding an inquiry into disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner‚Äôs possible sexual overtures to a minor. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chats with her staff, including aide Huma Abedin (L), onboard her plane in White Plains, New York, October 22, 2016, on her way to a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. / AFP / Robyn Beck (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images) Law enforcement officials have been hesitant to provide a timeline to the public for when the completion of its review of this treasure trove of emails. There may be evidence hiding in those emails that could incriminate Abedin‚Äôs boss, US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But we likely won‚Äôt find out until after the election, raising unsettling questions about the integrity of our fragile democracy. 
As a matter of principle, the FBI should tell the American people everything it knows before voters cast their ballots on November 8th.

Uh-oh. 
According to Bret Baier of Fox News, the FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year, and that investigation has been deep and wide ‚Äì and just as importantly, the FBI is on the verge of indictment for ‚Äúpay-for-play‚Äù with regard to Hillary‚Äôs State Department. The FBI investigation has uncovered laptops from Clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed. 
And most importantly of all , the sources at the FBI have apparently told Baier with ‚Äú99 percent accuracy‚Äù that Hillary‚Äôs server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and information was withdrawn. 
Meanwhile, we now know that the Department of Justice attempted to pressure the FBI into shutting down the investigation into the Clinton Foundation entirely. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI deputy director even asked the DOJ if they truly wanted to shut down a ‚Äúvalidly predicated investigation.‚Äù 
This is devastating information for Hillary. 
Donald Trump is now leading in Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Iowa, and North Carolina. Trump is within spitting distance in Colorado and Pennsylvania, and two new polls show Trump up in Virginia and New Hampshire, respectively. If Trump picks off any of those latter states, he wins the election. 
The best case scenario for Hillary Clinton just days ago was simple: hunker down and wait out these scandals. Assume that as time goes on, the race will revert back to its pre-Comey normal, with Hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead. But each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and State Department. Each new day demonstrates the extent of the cover-up by the Obama administration. 
Hillary‚Äôs running out of days to recover. 
The only question is whether she can hang on with her fingernails now, especially if the American public is upset enough about her pay-for-play and exposure of American classified material to put Trump in the White House, not trusting Loretta Lynch‚Äôs DOJ to prosecute Hillary for her crimes.

Ambition can be dangerous. Not just for the ambitious man or woman, but for the country ‚Äì for all those who ally with the ambitious person. 
For the last eight years, one of the most ambitious men in politics has been New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teacher‚Äôs unions in New Jersey ‚Äì brash language about ‚Äúpunching them in the face‚Äù marked his rise as a political force and an up-and-comer in presidential politics ‚Äì Christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the Republican Party in two straight presidential elections. 
In 2012, Christie was considered and rejected for vice president by Mitt Romney ‚Äì but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the Republican convention. There, he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders, ignoring Romney completely. Fox News‚Äô Chris Wallace called the speech ‚Äúthe most curious keynote speech I have ever heard‚Ä¶For a moment I forgot who was the nominee of the party.‚Äù 
Then, the week before the election, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast. While New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told President Obama that his presence was unnecessary, Christie invited Obama to New Jersey, then hugged him and took him on a tour of Atlantic City, where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies. ‚ÄúI cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state,‚Äù Christie said, adding that it was ‚Äúmy honor‚Äù to introduce President Obama. Christie was, at the time, facing down rumors that then-Newark Mayor Corey Booker, who is black, would run against him. As The New York Times noted, ‚ÄúThe scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management ‚Äì only it was run free of charge.‚Äù 
Obama surged in the final days and beat Romney handily. 
Fast forward three years. 
Christie was running in the Republican primaries. He‚Äôd done nothing much in the polls; his only hope was to somehow do well in New Hampshire. He had no support in states like South Carolina or Nevada, or southern states dominated by support for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. So, naturally, he used his presence at the debate before the New Hampshire primary ‚Äì a state in which Rubio was surging following his Iowa showing ‚Äì to destroy Rubio. Christie rightly labeled Rubio a robotic candidate, Rubio repeated himself, Christie hit him again ‚Äì and Rubio fell apart in the polling. Trump ran away with the state. Almost immediately, Christie quit the race and fell in behind Trump. Thanks in large part to Christie‚Äôs help, Trump won the nomination. 
Now, with Trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against Hillary Clinton, Christie has struck again: this time, two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to Bridgegate, the scandal in which the Christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local Democrat who wouldn‚Äôt endorse Christie‚Äôs re-election bid . This story will allow the media to shift its focus to the Trump campaign, since Christie is leader of Trump‚Äôs White House transition team. In a tight election, it could be enough to hand Hillary the White House. 
So thanks, Chris Christie. 
The Democrats couldn‚Äôt have done it without you. Tags";english;2016-11-05T03:00:36.461+02:00;dailywire.com;GB;15846.0;Christie Lost Republicans The 2012 Election.

Matt Yglesias of Vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder, given his penchant for saying things that are mind-bogglingly asinine. Apparently Yglesias agrees with this sentiment: Matt Yglesias deleted something like 30,000 tweets yesterday. Clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations. 
Fortunately, the Internet is forever and all of the stupid things that Yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly. 
Here are 11 things Yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb. 
1. Yglesias was convinced that people would love Obamacare. That is, until he didn't: . @mattyglesias Obamacare marker - which was solid as of 15 minutes ago - appears to no longer be markering pic.twitter.com/a0EyXImI8g ‚Äî Omri Ceren (@cerenomri) October 26, 2016 
His 2013 piece is still available though, and in it he whines about how supposedly ""the media, for non-ideological reasons, is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing."" Yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that ""when Obamacare becomes the status quo, people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten."" 
In other words, Yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking. That all fell by the wayside when the Obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of 25 percent. 
2. Yglesias made a racist comment toward former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R). In a 2013 tweet that is now deleted, Yglesias wrote, ""Is Bobby Jindal‚Äôs reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping?"" 
Yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash, tweeting: ""Oh, fun. Conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode."" 
Eventually, Yglesias backed down, tweeting: ""For the record, now that I know more about Jindal‚Äôs life it‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff."" 
The irony of Yglesias saying this was not lost on Twitter: Good thing you don't say dumb stuff. MT @mattyglesias It‚Äôs clear that Jindal‚Äôs a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff. ‚Äî jon gabriel (@exjon) June 18, 2013 
3. Yglesias once ranted against ""dumb Jewish politicians."" The leftist pundit wrote a ThinkProgress piece in 2009 that was seriously titled ""Dumb Jewish Politicians,"" in which Yglesias highlighted a passage from Jonathan Chait, who wrote in the New Republic that then-Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) had to be stupid for not supporting the public option. 
""I suspect that Lieberman is the beneficiary, or possibly the victim, of a cultural stereotype that Jews are smart and good with numbers,"" Chait wrote. ""Trust me, it‚Äôs not true. If Senator Smith from Idaho was angering Democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes, most liberals would deride him as an idiot. With Lieberman, we all suspect it‚Äôs part of a plan. I think he just has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about and doesn‚Äôt care to learn"" 
Yglesias agreed: 
I‚Äôve long held a related theory about Eric Cantor. 
Anyways, this reminds me that at a meeting this morning I pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret Christmas morning session that only Jewish Senators would attend. There‚Äôs a whole bunch‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBoxer, Cardin, Feingold, Feinstein, Franken, Kohl, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Sanders, Schumer, Specter, and Wyden. It‚Äôs a very progressive bunch and Lieberman could easily be outvoted 
4. Yglesias advocated for ending time zones. Seriously. In what was a typical example of Vox being a waste of space, Yglesias wrote a 2014 piece titled ""The case against time zones: They're impractical & outdated."" Yglesias pontificated: 
Northern Idaho is connected via I-90 to Spokane and Seattle to its west, but not to Boise to its south so the Couer d'Alene area is on Pacific Time rather than Mountain Time. India has broken with the general scheme and adopted a half-hour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time. 
Yet while these zig-zags and 30-minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time, they serve a very practical purpose. It is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings, calls, and other arrangements across time zones. The need to constantly specify which time zone you're talking about is a drag. Commuting across time zones would be more annoying still, which is why the suburbs of Chicago that are located in Indiana use Illinois' Central Time rather than Indianapolis' Eastern Time. 
But the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations. It's to shift the world to one giant time zone. 
Ygleasias then called for ""One time to rule them all""‚Äìa phrase that prompted J.R.R. Tolkien to weep in his grave‚Äìand then wrote this doozy: 
If the whole world used a single GMT-based time, schedules would still vary. In general most people would sleep when it's dark out and work when it's light out. So at 23:00, most of London would be at home or in bed and most of Los Angeles would be at the office. But of course London's bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in LA would be grabbing a nap. The difference from today is that if you were putting together a London-LA conference call at 21:00 there'd be only one possible interpretation of the proposal. A flight that leaves New York at 14:00 and lands in Paris at 20:00 is a six-hour flight, with no need to keep track of time zones. If your appointment is in El Paso at 11:30 you don't need to remember that it's in a different time zone than the rest of Texas. 
Pejman Yousefzadeh explained just how stupid Yglesias's time zone piece was, writing at Ricochet : ""I grant you that there are times when confusion does take place, but seriously, who cares? Is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that Matthew Yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them? Don‚Äôt the people at Vox have anything better to write about?"" 
Apparently they don't. 
5. Yglesias doesn't understand Florida's geography very well. Yglesias wrote a short blurb in The Atlantic in 2007, in which he began thinking aloud about the city of Miami. 
""I'd been interested to know what, if anything, is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know,"" Yglesias said. 
People immediately pointed the obvious answer: Miami couldn't do so because there was this thing called a swamp‚Äìmost of which is The Everglades National Park‚Äìcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish. 
""Yes, yes, commenters I know it's a freaking swamp but there's plenty of development on ex-swampland in Florida -- hence all the canals and weird-looking lakes,"" an exasperated Yglesias wrote in an update. 
Except that the land is not ""ex-swampland,"" it's an actual swamp . Maybe Yglesias shouldn't write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud. 
6. Yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fine...if you're a politician. Yglesias found himself getting smacked around on Twitter after he advocated for high-speed rail advocates to provide an ""unrealistically optimistic"" projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government. 
""For better or for worse, that‚Äôs politics,"" Yglesias wrote at ThinkProgress . 
On Twitter, Yglesias attempted to justify it by writing: ""Fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do, yes."" 
And yet, Yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist Eli Lake of being dishonest on Twitter. 
Yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a Catch-22 when he told the Daily Caller to ""go f*** yourself"" when they tried to interview him about the Twitter incident. 
7. Yglesias once hailed the Department of Veteran Affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate. The Federalist 's Sean Davis pointed to Yglesias writing in 2009 that the VA was ""producing the highest quality care in the country. Their turnaround points the way toward solving America‚Äôs health-care crisis."" Yglesias also tweeted at GOP chairman Reince Priebus in 2013, ""Will @Reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans?"" This tweet was also deleted, and for good reason, since the VA has caused 307,000 veteran deaths due to ""systemic"" problems with the agency. 
8. Yglesias doesn't understand the purpose of the Senate. Yglesias wrote the following for ThinkProgress in 2009, per the Guardian : 
If you add together the two Republican Senators from Wyoming with the one from Alaska, one from South Dakota, one from New Hampshire, two from Maine, two from Idaho, two from Nebraska, one from Nevada, two from Utah, two from Kansas, two from Mississippi, one from Iowa, two from Oklahoma, two from Kentucky, one from Louisiana, two from South Carolina, and two from Alabama, the 28 of them collectively represent (on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator) 11.98 percent of the American population. Meanwhile, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein together represent 11.95 percent of the American population. 
Now of course Texas is also a big state (though at 7.81 percent of the population it's a lot smaller than California) and there are small states (like Vermont and North Dakota) that have two Democratic Senators. So the point here isn't a narrowly partisan one, though the wacky apportionment of the Senate does have a partisan valence. The point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things. If you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population, we have just 34 Senators representing the above-average states even though they collectively contain 69.15 percent of the population. The other 66 Senators represent about 30 percent of the people. If the Iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution, nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them. 
In three paragraphs of rambling, incoherent nonsense, Yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations. 
9. Yglesias doesn't understand America's financial system. Yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a 2013 Slate column that there were ""far far far too many banks"" in the country, as there were 6,891 at the time. Yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous: 
1. They are poorly managed: You know how the best and brightest of Wall Street royally screw up sometimes? This doesn't get better when you drill down to the less-bright and not-as-good guys. It gets worse. And since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from FDIC-ensured depositors, nobody is watching the store. In effect, the well-managed banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones. The dubious decision-making doesn't get as complicated as what you see on Wall Street‚Äîit's mostly just classic boom-and-bust pro-cyclical commercial real estate loans‚Äîbut it creates all the same problems. 2. They can't be regulated: Since these banks are so small, they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs. So since American public policy is perversely committed to preserving them, small banks regularly get various kinds of carve-outs from regulations. And once the carve-outs exist, they create pressure for extension further up the food chain. Other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation. 3. They can't compete: If you want the JPMorgan Chases and Bank of Americas of the world to be held to account, you need both regulation and competition. But a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesn't offer any real competition. Having a large share of America's banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize big-time finance. 
Davis debunked Yglesias's argument, which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there haven't been any new banks formed in recent years (there were at least four in 2013.) 
""Yglesias' arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anti-community bank talking points promoted by the big banks ('You guys, the Wall Street banks that nearly destroyed America aren‚Äôt the problem. Small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem. Don‚Äôt worry about the facts. Just go with it.'),"" Davis wrote in The Federalist . ""I'm actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation."" 
10. Yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon. After reading a review of a Booker T. Washington biography, Yglesias started thinking about ""'black conservative' political tradition,"" prompting him to write in a 2009 ThinkProgress post, ""It's only extremely recently that the idea of an African-American aligning himself, √† la Clarence Thomas, with the mainstream conservative movement in America could be remotely possible. But even so, that didn‚Äôt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didn‚Äôt exist."" 
This is patently false, as Damon Root explained in Reason : 
Actually, the great Harlem Renaissance author and journalist George Schuyler‚Äîwho was known as the ‚Äúblack H.L. Mencken‚Äù‚Äîpublished ‚Äúgeneral rightist sentiments‚Äù long before Clarence Thomas came on the scene, including Schuyler‚Äôs unambiguously titled 1966 autobiography Black and Conservative. And the celebrated novelist and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston both endorsed conservative Sen. Robert A. Taft in the 1952 presidential election and repeatedly attacked FDR‚Äôs New Deal... 
11. Yglesias expressed joy when Andrew Breitbart died. Following Breitbart's death, Yglesias tweeted : ""Conventions around dead people are ridiculous. The world outlook is slightly improved with @AndrewBrietbart [sic] dead."" 
This tweet has also been deleted, and for good reason‚Äìcelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid, it's ghoulish, vile and reprehensible. And Slate defended Yglesias, stating that he ""is a very passionate journalist and Slate values that passion."" 
Apparently Slate believes that ""passion"" trumps basic human decency and a reasonable IQ level, and Yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities.

Media analyst and YouTuber Mark Dice took to the streets once again to ask the public what they think of this year's presidential election, specifically, what they think about ol' Crooked Hillary. 
In the video (below), titled ""Why Women Hate Hillary Clinton,"" Dice gives women the opportunity to voice their concerns about the character and integrity of the former Secretary of State, and the results are brutally honest. 
""What's wrong with Hillary? Why do everybody hate her,"" Dice asks the first woman who replies, ""Because she's a criminal."" 
""She's a liar and I hate her voice,"" another woman tells him, adding, ""Her voice drives me crazy."" 
A few more ladies tell Mark that Hillary is a liar, she's terrible, with one woman adding, ""She lost to Obama eight years ago so why is she still running. It's kind of absurd to me."" 
The women also had problems with Hillary's constant scandals, dirty money, bad policies, and her relentlessly playing the gender card. 
""I just believe in more personal freedom and less government control,"" one jogger told the host, while another summed it up with, ""It's time for a change, Hillary's out of here."" 
Exit thought from Dice: 
Hillary Clinton is not a woman. It is a demon. Stop saying ""first female this, and first female that."" Demons have no gender. ‚Äî Mark Dice (@MarkDice) August 31, 2016

A YouTube video that's making the rounds appears to show a man being beaten and robbed in the middle of the street by a group laughing and shouting that he voted for Trump. 
In the clip (below), what appears to be a middle-aged white man is on the ground while two younger black males are hitting and kicking him in the head. The camera person yells, ""Happens when you vote Trump, dummy,"" while a woman next to him shouts, ""You voted Trump? You voted Trump? Damn! Yeah, he voted Trump! Damn!"" 
The man continues to struggle against his two attackers until he gets up and sees that a woman, presumably associated with the attackers, is going through the his car looking for valuables. 
""Get out of my car,"" the man yells as he approaches the women, who shouts back, ""You're gonna pay for my shit!"" One of the attackers returns and starts punching the man from behind in the back of the head and then continues swinging as the man turns around. 
The camera man and his companion continue their color commentary by laughing and yelling, ""Beat his ass! Don't vote Trump! Don't vote Trump!"" 
The video ends with the group acknowledging that they should leave before the police arrive. 
In the longer version of the video (below) posted on Twitter, one of the attackers gets into the driver's seat and closes the door. The beaten Trump supporter stands at the car window, presumably telling the thief to get out, as the woman starts to punch him in the back of the head and is joined by the second attacker. 
The criminal then hits the gas and takes off in the car as the man desperately holds on from outside through the rear door's window while being dragged through the streets.

This is the best picture in human history. 
It is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties, the republic, and why we are where we are. 
On the left side of this picture, we have Donald Trump ‚Äì a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian, the new president-elect of the United States. He points his fingers and smiles that Apprentice smile as he makes a point. 
On the right side of this picture, we have Barack Obama ‚Äì a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude, who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant. He sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud, the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office. And Obama, rightly, looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes. 
Behind Obama sits a bust of Abraham Lincoln, his eyes downcast, mourning for his country. 
Yep. 
Greatest picture ever. 
This is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant. Barack Obama‚Äôs image of himself is not accurate ‚Äì to Americans, Obama is a reality TV show star. He transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfie-stick, celebrity-ridden sinkhole of Hollywood glitterati, hobnobbing with Glozell and Macklemore, cracking wise about the presidency with Jimmy Kimmel before saying that a reality star like Trump could never be president. 
This picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost, as Obama‚Äôs former pastor might put it. 
And then there‚Äôs Lincoln. 
Lincoln, who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration, mourning behind Barack Obama, who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain. 
Lincoln, who represented wisdom, mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd. Given Republicans‚Äô domination of the Senate and the Congress, I have hopes for Trump‚Äôs presidency ‚Äì I hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president, and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises ‚Äì but Trump occupying Lincoln‚Äôs office is, at best, a jarring visual.

So, in a not-unexpected move, Donald Trump has elevated former Breitbart News CEO Steve Bannon to chief strategist of the White House. 
When I left Breitbart back in March, I accused Bannon of turning Breitbart News into Trump Pravda ; as I wrote, ‚ÄúIndeed, Breitbart News, under the chairmanship of Steve Bannon, has put a stake through the heart of Andrew‚Äôs legacy. In my opinion, Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out Andrew‚Äôs mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump; he has shaped the company into Trump‚Äôs personal Pravda, to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter.‚Äù 
That decision paid off for Bannon ‚Äì in August, he became Trump‚Äôs campaign ‚ÄúCEO.‚Äù At that point, I wrote this piece describing who Bannon was , and this one for The Washington Post describing his probable impact on the campaign . 
With Bannon‚Äôs accession to a top White House role, it‚Äôs time to answer some brief questions about the man and what he‚Äôs likely to do. 
Is Bannon Anti-Semitic And Racist? I have no evidence that Bannon‚Äôs a racist or that he‚Äôs an anti-Semite; the Huffington Post‚Äôs blaring headline ‚ÄúWHITE NATIONALIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE‚Äù is overstated, at the very least. With that said, as I wrote at The Washington Post in August, Bannon has openly embraced the racist and anti-Semitic alt-right ‚Äì he called his Breitbart ‚Äú the platform of the alt-right .‚Äù Milo Yiannopoulos, the star writer at the site, is an alt-right popularizer , even as he continuously declares with a wink that he‚Äôs not a member. The left‚Äôs opposition to Trump, and their attempts to declare all Trump support the alt-right have obfuscated what the movement is. The movement isn‚Äôt all Trump supporters. It‚Äôs not conservatives unsatisfied with Paul Ryan, nor is it people angry at the media. Bannon knows that. He‚Äôs a smart man, not an ignorant one. The alt-right, in a nutshell, believes that Western culture is inseparable from European ethnicity . I have no evidence Bannon believes that personally. But he‚Äôs happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into European far-right nationalist populism. That means that the alt-right will cheer Bannon along as he marbles Trump‚Äôs speeches with talk of ‚Äúglobalism‚Äù ‚Äì and that Bannon won‚Äôt be pushing Trump to dump the racists and anti-Semites who support Trump anytime soon. After all, they love Bannon ‚Äì actual white supremacists like Peter Brimelow called his August appointment ‚Äúgreat news,‚Äù and Richard Spencer explained, ‚ÄúBreitbart has elective affinities with the Alt Right, and the Alt Right has clearly influenced Breitbart. In this way, Breitbart has acted as a ‚Äògateway‚Äô to Alt Right ideas and writers. I don‚Äôt think it has done this deliberately; again, it‚Äôs a matter of elective affinities.‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt mean Bannon will push racist or anti-Semitic policy, or that he‚Äôll be anti-Israel himself ‚Äì unless it serves his interests. 
What Does Bannon‚Äôs Accession Mean? Bannon has goals. One of those goals is maximization of personal power, which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful right-wing personalities (Bachmann, Morris, Palin), kissing their asses, and then moving on up the chain. With Breitbart and Trump, he picked two winners in a row ‚Äì and that means he‚Äôs now at the pinnacle of American power. 
So, what will he do with that power? He‚Äôll target enemies. Bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics, which is why I‚Äôve been joking for months that should Trump win, I‚Äôd be expecting my IRS audit any moment. That wasn‚Äôt completely a joke. He likes to destroy people. 
But more importantly, Bannon‚Äôs interested in turning the Republican Party into a far-right European party. Because Republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that, it could happen. Here‚Äôs what I wrote in March about the Trump movement : 
Trump is a European-style response to the European-style leftism of Barack Obama. He‚Äôs a soft European-style populist, from his interventionist economics to his closed-borders foreign policy. As I wrote in December, ‚ÄúCompare Trump‚Äôs platform with that of Marine Le Pen, whose French National Front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment. She calls for harsher penalties for criminals, significant restrictions on Muslim immigration to France, protectionism on trade, a restoration of the Franc as the national currency rather than the Euro, and big government in terms of health care. This sounds a lot like Trump.‚Äù But the European right is not the American right. The American right believes in Constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government. The European right doesn‚Äôt believe any of these things. Should Trump win, we could watch American conservatism lose the only party it has ever had. 
That‚Äôs the plan. Yesterday, The Daily Beast reported that Bannon reached out to Le Pen for ‚Äúglobal ultra-right coalition.‚Äù Over the weekend Le Pen met with Nigel Farage of the UK Independent Party. And Trump met with Farage shortly after being elected. Bannon has always wanted to burn down the GOP. That‚Äôs still his goal. He wants it replaced with an American National Front party in fact if not in name. 
Which War Will Bannon Lead? Bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore ‚Äì always at war. Always. So the only question left is this: what will Bannon‚Äôs actual role be? It‚Äôs difficult to tell, since Trump announced the Bannon hire at the same time he announced that former RNC chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff. What will their relationship be like? Ed Morrissey of HotAir thinks that Bannon will lead the anti-media fight, and Reince will coordinate with Congress. That would be the best possible scenario. 
Others have speculated that Bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base, which would be angry at Trump hopping into bed with the most establishment-y fellow in Washington. That, too, would be fine. 
It‚Äôs hard to tell from the outside what‚Äôs happening, but here‚Äôs a third theory: Reince is the bagman for Trump, and Bannon‚Äôs whispering in Trump‚Äôs ear. That would fit the fact pattern here, given Reince‚Äôs outsized praise for Bannon this morning: ‚Äúwise and smart‚Ä¶very, very smart, very temperate.‚Äù Bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree. He‚Äôs a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees; he's actually malevolent. Priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because he‚Äôs the one catering to Bannon‚Äôs agenda. 
If Bannon‚Äôs leading and Reince is following, that bodes ill for the Republican agenda. Bannon opposes the Republican Party, hates Paul Ryan ‚Äì minutes after the joint Bannon/Priebus announcement, Breitbart News approvingly tweeted about a Congressional rebellion against Speaker Ryan ‚Äì and wants to watch it all ‚Äúburn.‚Äù Bannon loves the firefight. The only question is which direction he‚Äôll turn his fire.

Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro spoke at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Wednesday night, and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him, found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium. 
After the ovation he received on entering, Shapiro quipped, ‚ÄúHey look at this. A campus that doesn‚Äôt actually try to arrest me when I come.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúBefore I begin, I did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room. I hear you‚Äôve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how you‚Äôre not one of these awful, terrible Trump people, that you‚Äôre sensitive, and that you want to signal your virtue, so I‚Äôve brought along these safety pins, (holding up safety pins) and I also brought you something to wear them with ‚Äì this diaper."" 
Shapiro then held up a diaper, prompting huge laughs from the audience. 
When a protester yelled at Shapiro that he should be ‚Äúwearing a swastika,‚Äù Shapiro held out his yarmulke, then fired back, ‚ÄúIn case you hadn‚Äôt noticed, the folks with the swastikas aren‚Äôt too nice to my type.‚Äù 
Shapiro continued, ‚ÄúStop being self-indulgent children; stop pretending that everybody who voted for Trump is a vicious racist; it‚Äôs your right to protest, of course, but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a duly-held election ‚Ä¶ Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt care about your protest. Donald Trump is sitting somewhere in Trump Tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty, salty tears.‚Äù 
Referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who weren‚Äôt university students from attending Shapiro‚Äôs lecture, Shapiro opined: ‚ÄúI hear that a lot of folks at this publicly-funded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants. I do have a quick question: if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally, why are so many people trying to ban American citizens from this community from coming to this lecture? And by the way, I‚Äôm aware of this private Facebook page titled ‚ÄòF(***) White Supremacy: Interrupting Ben Shapiro.' With all due respect, ‚ÄòF‚Äô you right back, gang.‚Äù 
After the applause subsided and Shapiro joked about how both Black Lives Mater and the KKK target him, the real fun began. Protesters stood up, chanting, ‚ÄúShame‚Äù over and over again. 
Shapiro quipped, ‚ÄúWow, it‚Äôs like Game of Thrones . Should I get undressed and walk down the aisle?‚Äù 
The bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters. Shapiro addressed the protesters, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to talk with you,‚Äù but they responded by screaming ‚Äúsafety‚Äù over and over. Shapiro joked, ‚ÄúDid somebody fart?‚Äù The crowd responded to the protesters by chanting, ‚ÄúUSA.‚Äù 
Shapiro replied, ‚ÄúI tell you try not to be children; the first thing you do is start screaming like my two-year-old.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúYou see, this is how conservatives actually treat people; you stand up and you interrupt and you shout ‚ÄòSafety,‚Äù and you‚Äôre perfectly safe. Look at that. It‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù That provoked sustained applause. 
When the protesters started screaming ‚ÄúShame‚Äù again, Shapiro eviscerated them, pointing out, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to pick a chant like ‚ÄòShame,‚Äô watch Game of Thrones first. The bad guys shout ‚ÄòShame.‚Äô‚Äù The audience loved that line. On a roll, Shapiro continued, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not changing anybody‚Äôs mind, All you‚Äôre showing everybody is that your collective IQ, if it were channeled into electricity, night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly.‚Äù 
He continued, ‚ÄúOkay, can we talk now, or are you going to keep shouting? Now‚Äôs your chance to get it out. Let‚Äôs hear your feelings. C‚Äômon. Just go for it. Or is it going to be like every thirty seconds; like an annoying microwave timer?‚Äù 
When the protesters resumed chanting, Shapiro responded, ‚ÄúIf you guys want to talk, we can talk, If you want to shout, get the hell out.‚Äù More applause. 
Shapiro fired, ‚ÄúFor God's sake, at least wait until I say something that offends you before getting offended."" 
Shapiro returned to deconstructing the term ‚Äúsocial justice.‚Äù When the protesters started again, a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up, and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day, and that they should ‚Äúshut freaking up and listen to the man speak.‚Äù That prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and Shapiro. too. He added, ‚ÄúSee, that‚Äôs what a decent, hard-working person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime, presumably.‚Äù 
Shapiro returned to his speech: ‚ÄúRacial diversity doesn‚Äôt mean anything; decency means everything ‚Ä¶ Diversity isn‚Äôt our strength; decency is our strength.‚Äù He turned to the protesters: Remember that? Decency.‚Äù 
The protesters screamed back, ‚ÄúShame!‚Äù Shapiro fired back, ‚ÄúDecency!‚Äù The protesters chanted ‚ÄúShame‚Äù but the crowd soon joined Shapiro in chanting ‚ÄúDecency,‚Äù shutting the protesters up. 
As Shapiro spoke of the falsity of ‚Äúwhite privilege,‚Äù the protesters formed a line in front of Shapiro, prompting him to quip, ‚ÄúIf you guys are all going to come up here, can we all just have circle time or something?‚Äù 
The protesters chanted ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù for a minute and a half, but then the crowd started yelling back, ‚ÄúFree speech matters.‚Äù Shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters, ‚ÄúMORONS‚Äù That again prompted cheering. 
One member of the audience yelled to the protesters, ‚ÄúAt least tell us what you want, or otherwise, just get out!‚Äù That brought a sustained ovation. 
After one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue, the protesters started shouting ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù again, then filed out, yelling ‚ÄúF*** white supremacy‚Äù while flipping off Shapiro and the entire audience. That prompted the crowd to sing, ‚ÄúNa-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, good-bye.‚Äù It also promoted this from Shapiro: 
Even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door. 
After Shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested, as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage, or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event, he continued, ‚ÄúAll I can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event.‚Äù 
Even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door, prompting Shapiro to quip, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt this school give homework? Does anybody have a job around here? I guess when you‚Äôre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands.‚Äù 
Shapiro noted that he had engaged in a back-and-forth with one of the protesters, who accused him of being a white supremacist. When he asked her why she thought so, she replied that she got that impression from his image. He fired back, ‚ÄúReally? Was it the yarmulke that did it for you?‚Äù 
He took another shot at the protesters during the speech, noting that people were born unequal, and adding, ‚ÄúSome people us are born rich; some of us are born poor; some of us are born smart; some of us are born protesters.‚Äù 
The rest of the speech was vintage Shapiro, as was the Q&A afterward. Even the chalk was impressive:

The media, desperately in search of a narrative to cast the incoming Trump administration as dangerously incompetent, are once again overplaying their hands. Instead of focusing on the nepotistic fact that Trump relies heavily on his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his daughter, Ivanka ‚Äì he invited them to a state meeting with Japan ‚Äì they‚Äôre trying to claim that he just isn‚Äôt moving fast enough on appointments. 
That‚Äôs nuts. 
Barack Obama didn‚Äôt name his picks for Secretary of State, Defense, or Attorney General until December 1, nearly a month after the November 4, 2008 election. George W. Bush didn‚Äôt name his picks for State, Defense, or Attorney General until mid-December (December 16 for Colin Powell, December 28 for Donald Rumsfeld, December 22 for John Ashcroft). Bill Clinton didn‚Äôt name his picks for those positions until at least December 22. George H.W. Bush was the fastest off the mark ‚Äì he named James Baker Secretary of State the day after the November 8 election. Ronald Reagan waited until December 11 to get started; Jimmy Carter waited until December 3. 
We‚Äôre still waiting on Trump‚Äôs State and Defense picks, but he‚Äôs already out of the gate with Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. It‚Äôs November 17. 
The media are so eager to bury Trump‚Äôs administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so. Instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks ‚Äì Steve Bannon, for example, is a rotten pick , but not because he‚Äôs a racist or anti-Semite ‚Äì the media keep proclaiming THE END IS NEAR. This sort of alarmism doesn‚Äôt convince Americans, who don‚Äôt really see why there‚Äôs any giant rush to appoint people who aren‚Äôt going to be formally considered by the Senate until January 20 anyway. 
If this election was about repudiation of the media ‚Äì and it was ‚Äì the media aren‚Äôt doing themselves any favors when they promulgate fact-free narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù For years, Americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day. Each day, the media seem determined to prove them right. Tags ";english;2016-11-18T19:01:54.993+02:00;dailywire.com;US;15846.0;Media Claim Trump Transition Chaos.

President-elect Donald Trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who has long been a favorite of conservatives. The Democrats already have the long knives out for Sessions, spit-balling their usual accusations of racism‚Äìwhich should indicate that Sessions will be an effective attorney general. 
Here are seven things you need to know about Sessions. 
1. Sessions has a 78 percent liberty score on Conservative Review . Sessions has been in the Senate for 20 years, and has been described by the Washington Times as ""a tea partier before the tea party was cool,"" per Conservative Review 's biography . 
2. Sessions has been one of the leaders in the Senate in fighting against amnesty. For instance, Sessions was among the most prominent members of the Senate leading the opposition to the Gang of Eight Bill. National Review , which dubbed Sessions ""amnesty's worst enemy,"" explained how Sessions would reveal ""true facts"" about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadn't decided how to vote on the legislation. Sessions and Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) would find other clever ways to oppose the bill, such as ""an amendment to a resolution honoring the late Latino union organizer Cesar Chavez"" in which Vitter noted Chavez's opposition to illegal immigration, putting Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) in ""an awkward position."" 
In 2015, Sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system, according to Conservative Review : Overturned the Zadvydas v. Davis Supreme Court case that Obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention Explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law Eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off DHS and DOJ law enforcement grants Expedited deportation of gang members Applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving Clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported (this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the Washington, D.C. ‚Äúmansion murders‚Äù) 
Sessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration, as he has railed against it as ""the primary source of low-wage immigration into the United States."" 
""What we need now is immigration moderation: slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together,"" Sessions wrote in a 2015 op-ed in the Washington Post . 
3. Sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues. According to Conservative Review 's biography of Sessions: 
In January 2011, he was named Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee. In this capacity, he led the Republican charge against Majority Leader Harry Reid and Barack Obama for not offering a serious budget proposal, given that the Senate had not passed a budget since April 2009. He has fought guerilla warfare, often a lonely battle, against Democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps. He has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the Ryan-Murray budget deal. Sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state. 
Sessions has voted against the TARP bailout, stimulus bills, and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state ""with charts warning of the United States' 'crippling' debt,"" per the Washington Post . 
4. Sessions endorsed Trump early on. To the surprise of many in the establishment, Sessions endorsed Trump in February, declaring , ""I believe we are on a movement that must not fade away. This is a campaign, this is a movement. The American people are not happy with their government."" 
It shouldn't have come as a surprise though, given Session's record on immigration and that Sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade. 
5. Sessions is well-liked by his Senate colleagues on a personal level. According to the Washington Post : 
""Say what you will about him,"" former longtime Senate Democratic communications aide Jim Manley told the Almanac of American Politics. ""He was always nice to [the late Ted] Kennedy and other Democrats as well."" 
Even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him. Stanley-Becker talked to Susan Parker, a Democrat who tried to unseat Sessions in 2002. During a debate, she asked for a tissue and Sessions handed her one. She joked she would use it to dry her eyes when Sessions made her cry, and he responded: ""Please don‚Äôt say that. That‚Äôs my nightmare. I promise I‚Äôll be nice."" 
It's no wonder then that Sessions will likely be confirmed by the Senate. 
6. Accusations of racism against Sessions are absurd. When President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions, who at the time was a U.S. attorney, to a federal judge, the Democrats smeared Sessions with accusations of racism, which included: Calling a black attorney ""boy."" Quipping about the Ku Klux Klan: ""I used to think they were OK, but they are pot smokers."" Joking that a white attorney was ""a traitor to his race"" because he was collaborating with civil rights groups. Calling the NAACP and ACLU ""un-American."" Prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud. 
The last point isn't racist at all. The jokes, as Ben Shapiro has written , were made ""in front of the black lawyer; even the lawyer accusing Sessions of racism acknowledged that Sessions was joking."" Clearly Sessions meant them as harmless jokes. Sessions has also denied calling the lawyer ""boy."" The civil rights group Sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years. 
Sessions' record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism, as The Weekly Standard 's Mark Hemingway writes: 
As a U.S. Attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in Alabama. And he also prosecuted the head of the state Klan, Henry Francis Hays, for abducting and killing Michael Donald, a black teenager selected at random. Sessions insisted on the death penalty for Hays. When he was later elected the state Attorney General, Sessions followed through and made sure the Hays executed. The successful prosecution of Hays also led to a $7 million civil judgment against the Klan, effectively breaking the back of the KKK in Alabama. 
7. As attorney general, Sessions would uphold the rule of law. The reason why Sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law. He has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty. Between that and his legal background as a U.S. attorney and Alabama attorney general, there is every reason to believe that Sessions will follow the law and not politicize the Justice Department. 
""His interpretation of the law will not please everyone, but I predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor,"" Robert Driscoll , former deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in National Review . ""Clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor. Creative interpretations of the law may cease, but the meat-and-potatoes work of the division (intentional discrimination, police misconduct, disability law) will continue apace, conducted without impropriety or political favoritism. That alone will be a breath of fresh air.""

The Democratic congressman who is challenging House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, threatened a ‚ÄúYoungstown street fight‚Äù if Donald Trump attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. 
Speaking with Jake Tapper on CNN‚Äôs State of the Union on Sunday, Ryan intimated that defunding Planned Parenthood wasn‚Äôt the only stimulus he would need to launch violence. He stated, ‚ÄúIf he tries to defund Planned Parenthood, if he tries to kick people off their health insurance, if they try to privatize Medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy, you know, we are going to have a Youngstown street fight in the Capitol.‚Äù 
Youngstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past; last May and August violence erupted on the streets of the city. 
Ryan called Trump‚Äôs infrastructure plan ‚Äúa bunch of smoke and mirrors.‚Äù He added that he didn‚Äôt blame Pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt in good conscience hang this election around Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs neck, of course. But, moving forward, we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for Donald Trump, even in my district, where they voted for me and they voted for Donald Trump.‚Äù 
Ryan‚Äôs campaign to replace Pelsoi is picking up steam; on Sunday, New York Rep. Kathleen Rice endorsed him, stating, ""He has a lot of good ideas, but maybe most importantly, he also isn‚Äôt suggesting he has all the answers ‚Äî he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing, that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy,"" Rice said in a statement.

Conversing with fellow Daily Show ‚Äúcomic‚Äù John Oliver at the Montclair Film Festival on Saturday night, Late Show unfunny host Stephen Colbert admitted that he couldn‚Äôt even conceive that Donald trump would win the presidency; so much so that he couldn‚Äôt write jokes bout Trump winning for election night. 
In the roughly two-hour discussion and Q&A titled ‚ÄúWow, That Was Weird,‚Äù Montclair Film Festival executive director Tom Hall set the somber tone by allowing, ""When we planned this evening, I think we all thought we'd be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face."" 
Speaking of the Late Show ‚Äôs Election Night special on Showtime, Colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired: 
There was not a bear big enough in the world that we weren't loaded for. We were so loaded for every possible eventuality. We had so many guests. We had so many pre-taped pieces, all based on a different eventuality. We had three shows: Hillary Clinton wins and we know; Hillary Clinton wins and we don‚Äôt know, because it‚Äôs not called before the show‚Äôs over; Donald Trump's going to win and we don‚Äôt know, because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory. That's not wishful thinking, that's what everyone was saying. 
And then there was the last show, which is the show we did, which is Donald Trump is going to win and we know he's going to win. My execs and my writers were like, ‚ÄúYou don't want to write something for that?‚Äù and I'm like, ‚ÄúNo! There is nothing you can write. You don't understand. I have 400 people in my theater. If we know Donald Trump is going to win, it's going to be like doing stand-up comedy for one of those Chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives. There will be no laughter!‚Äù We only did about 20 minutes of material before we went, ‚ÄúF‚Äî it, it's going to be him, let's just talk for another hour.‚Äù So I think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night. 
Colbert moaned that the special was ""the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,"" adding, ""I was tying my tie at 10:30 and I went, 'Oh, he took Ohio. Oh, well, we expected that. He took it by 11 points. Wow! That's not expected.' And then over my guests' shoulders, people kept holding up signs that said, 'Florida, Iowa, Nebraska.'"" He revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared, but ""none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned. Our audience was sobbing openly. And those are people who work for me, like my cameramen."" 
As Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro pointed out years ago , Colbert's manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives: 
He engages in Conservativeface. He needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative ‚Äì after all, conservatives come in every shape and size. Instead, he acts as though he is a conservative ‚Äì an idiotic, racist, sexist, bigoted, brutal conservative. He out-Archie Bunkers Archie Bunker. His audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious ‚ÄúColbert‚Äù who wishes to persecute gays; they chortle at evil sexist ‚ÄúColbert‚Äù who thinks men are victims of sexism. This is the purpose of Colbert‚Äôs routine. His show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks. In order to justify their racism, racists had to create a false perception of blacks; in the same way, Colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives. 
On Saturday night, Colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a Trump presidency, arguing, ""I‚Äôm all for giving him a chance, but don‚Äôt give him an inch. Because I believed everything he said, and I remember everything he said. And it‚Äôs horrifying. It's possible. The job changes a man. That's the cliche of the presidency."" He pontificated: 
Every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say, ‚ÄúWell, there are levers of power in Washington that can slow him down.‚Äù But two things: One is they're cowards. Second is that the levers in Washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull. Because they tried to stop Trump. Everybody tried to stop Trump, do not delude yourself. 
Everyone except the people he's going to appoint tried to stop him and they didn't. He owes them nothing. He goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd, ‚ÄúShall I do it?‚Äù And they say, '‚ÄùYes.‚Äù And he says, ‚ÄúIt shall be so.‚Äù And the balcony is Twitter. He goes onto Twitter and he goes, ‚ÄúWhat do you think? Do you think I'm right?‚Äù That's what scares me, that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn't. And he's a vindictive person. So it's all going to be fine. Merry Christmas. ‚ÄúNo! There is nothing you can write."" Stephen Colbert 
Colbert concluded, ""The next person who says to me, 'You must be happy on a certain level,‚Äô is going to have their eye carved out.‚Äù

So, soon-to-be-ex-President Obama won‚Äôt be going away anytime soon. 
After George W. Bush left office, he essentially went silent. He had no criticism for President Obama; he didn‚Äôt sound off about Mitt Romney or Donald Trump. He went away. Not so for Obama. It seems that Barack Obama will follow the Jimmy Carter pathway to Annoyingland: he‚Äôll be commenting whenever possible. After acknowledging that Bush ‚Äúcould not have been more gracious to me when I came in,‚Äù Obama said, ‚ÄúAs an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals, and if I think that it‚Äôs necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, I‚Äôll examine it when it comes.‚Äù 
This comes as welcome news for Republicans. Obama‚Äôs policy unpopularity ‚Äì and his tendency to lecture from on high to Americans in rural areas ‚Äì means that he‚Äôll suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing Trump and Republicans. Middle Americans voted for Trump in order to sound off against Obama‚Äôs obvious scorn for them. Here‚Äôs what Obama had to say about those who didn‚Äôt vote for Trump in today‚Äôs Der Spiegel : 
If you look at the new generation of Americans, they reflect the vision that I spoke about. They're diverse. They believe in tolerance. They're accepting of things like same-sex marriage. They believe in integration. The problem, though, is that young people are less likely to vote than older people. What results is a situation in which sometimes the elections don't fully reflect the views of the American population. Essentially, the president-elect was supported by about 27 percent of the American population. One of our challenges, historically, is that we have very low voting rates, even during presidential elections. 
This sort of language drove Americans to Trump. And if Obama continues to critique Trump from the outside with this sort of language, not only will he be doing Trump a favor, he‚Äôll be preventing any other Democrat from taking a leading role in opposing Trump. He‚Äôll become the point of resistance for his own party ‚Äì and his party won‚Äôt be able to escape his shadow. 
Obama‚Äôs ego has already cost his party the presidency, the Senate, the House, a bevy of state legislators and governor‚Äôs mansions. Now it may cost them the future.

With Donald Trump set to take office in a couple of months, a number of his lackeys have reportedly been in talks about possibly serving in the administration. As of this writing, there are three pro-Trump pundits that might be in the Trump administration. 
Eric Bolling. Politico reported that Bolling was seen at Trump Tower and was reportedly discussed for a position in the Department of Commerce. What exactly that position that will be is not clear. Bolling told Politico that he ""can't confirm anything."" 
Geraldo Rivera flat-out asked Bolling on The Five if he had been offered a job, and Bolling gave a non-answer . 
Bolling has been with Fox News since 2008, where he is the co-host of The Five and hosts the weekend show Cashin' In . Before then, he had been an analyst on CNBC and a New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) trader. Bolling has been an ardent supporter of Trump from the get-go, to the point where he resorted to some loony ideas . 
Laura Ingraham. According to CNN Money , Ingraham is being heavily considered for President Trump's press secretary. Here is what Ingraham has said on the matter: 
""I am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs. So we'll see what happens,"" Ingraham said on Fox News. 
She cautioned: ""I think people are getting a little far ahead of the narrative."" But she strongly suggested that some sort of Trump administration post is in the works. 
""It's a big decision, but I'm at the point where, if my country needs me, and if I can do something to actually, you know, advance the Trump agenda, which is stuff I have written about now for 15 years, with trade, immigration and just renewing America, then I obviously have to seriously consider that,"" she told Fox's Tucker Carlson. 
Like Bolling, Ingraham, who has been a nationally syndicated radio host since 2001 , has also been an early supporter of Trump, going as far as saying that #NeverTrump conservatives support partial birth abortion, and her website, LifeZette, attacked conservatives like Ben Shapiro for opposing the Alt-Right. (As usual, Shapiro punched back hard .) 
Jeanine Pirro. Pirro, accompanied by Rudy Giuliani, was seen headed inside Trump Tower, which has led to speculation that she is being considered for a job in the Trump administration, according to Page Six . What that job would be is not known. 
Pirro also has been an early Trump supporter, and she has claimed to have known him for 30 years . Pirro's ex-husband, Al Pirro, has been described as ""a man Donald Trump keeps on retainer"" as a real-estate lawyer, and Trump once donated $20,000 to Pirro when she ran for New York state attorney general. 
Pirro has been with Fox News since 2006 and hosts Justice with Judge Jeanine on Saturdays. She also has an extensive legal career as a prosecutor in the state of New York and initially challenged Hillary Clinton when she ran for re-election in the Senate before dropping out to run for state attorney general.

For some people, fishing is a long, boring day of sitting and staring endlessly at a rod and reel that may never get a bite. But what if you could get down with those mocking water-breathers and have high-noon shoot-out with them the way nature intended? 
Well, that's just what some Florida boys thought when they decided to take their modified Glock 9mm pistol into the Gulf of Mexico to help deal with the infestation of Lionfish. 
TheSickest provides some more details on the Lionfish overpopulation problem and the boys' creative way to address it: 
""Lionfish are an invasive species with no natural predators who‚Äôs females lay a staggering two million eggs a year. The intersection between ammunition-happy Americans and the determent of an overpopulated species is where the the use of this new sporting phenomenon was birthed. 
Lionsfish were never intended to be in the Gulf of Mexico, and while its speculated that their transplant may be linked to a hurricanes back in the 90‚Äôs, because of their rapid reproductive nature the waters have become flooded by their presence. 
A single Lionsfish consumes 80% reef‚Äôs edible baitfish within five weeks of arriving on that reef ‚Äì incredibly damaging to plant that is the cornerstone of the underwater ecosystem. The issue has gotten to a point where entering the Florida coast at any time can mean running across thousands of Lionsfish, just posted up chilling. 
The good news is that the introduction of the gun has the potential of bringing hunters and otherwise uninterested fishers to the gulf for a fun filled time of shooting underwater, an activity that actually looks like a blast."" 
The video below shows just how fun it can be: 
""Shooting invasive Lionfish over 100ft underwater with customized Glock 9mm handgun in the Gulf of Mexico,"" the video description states. ""The project started to see if we could shoot a gun underwater and it evolved into much more with the right people involved. Lionfish are an invasive species that need to be eradicated.

Today Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery talked about Hillary‚Äôs clear acts of treason against the United States by providing massive shipments of weapons to Saudi Arabia at a time that she knew they were providing support to ISIS. Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election. BLOOD ON THE TRAITOR‚ÄôS HANDS! 
Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely.

The fact is that Hillary should be prosecuted, not inaugurated. She has supported ISIS in its war against Syria its terrorism against America. She has sent paid thugs to disrupt Trump‚Äôs political events. She has used her government positions to peddal influence. She really should be in prison.

Warning of JCS Chairman General Dunford;"Clinton‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo-Fly Zone‚Äù over Syria Will Lead to War with Russia. Warning of JCS Chairman General Dunford October 27, 2016 at 10:18 am Global Research , October 23, 2016 The media has failed to address the confrontation between the U.S. State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Francis Dunford (image right) has warned both the US Senate as well Secretary of State John Kerry in no uncertain terms that a ‚ÄúNo Fly Zone‚Äù over Syria would lead to war with both Syria and Russia, intimating a dangerous process of military escalation. 
In a Senate Arms Services Committee hearing, Dunford said, responding to questions from Republican Senator Roger Whicker (Mississippi) 
‚ÄúRight now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I‚Äôm not going to make.‚Äù ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) 
At the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president, she would implement a no-fly-zone, intimating that the objective was to ‚Äúsave lives‚Äù: 
‚ÄúI think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general,‚Äù Clinton said in response to a question from Fox News debate moderator Chris Wallace. 
‚ÄúThis would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the Russians and Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground ‚Ä¶ I think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in Syria.‚Äù (Fox News, emphasis added) 
At present, under the Obama administration, the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the ‚ÄúNo Fly zone‚Äù. 
The Joint Chiefs of Staff are appointed by the Secretary of Defense. 
Under a Clinton presidency, a new Secretary of Defense as well as a new Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, firmly committed to ‚ÄúA No fly Zone‚Äù over Syria would be appointed. 
Mich√®le Angelique Flournoy, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy is Hillary‚Äôs choice for the position of Secretary of Defense, who favors the ‚ÄúNo Fly Zone‚Äù option. 
According to Defense One: ‚ÄùThe woman expected to run the Pentagon under Hillary Clinton said she would direct U.S. troops to push President Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs forces out of southern Syria and would send more American boots to fight the Islamic State in the region.‚Äù 
Confirmed by the Leaked Emails Michele Flournoy is a crony of the Clintons. She has ‚Äúcalled for ‚Äúlimited military coercion‚Äù to help remove Assad from power in Syria, including a ‚Äúno bombing‚Äù zone over parts of Syria held by U.S.-backed rebels.‚Äù This is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including ISIS Daesh from actions by Syrian and Russian forces. 
According to Defense One: Flournoy, and several of her colleagues at the Center for New American Security, or CNAS, have been making the case for sending more American troops into combat against ISIS and the Assad regime than the Obama administration has been willing to commit.
Since Russia‚Äôs increased involvement, the facts on the ground in Syria, she said, ‚ÄúDo not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to.‚Äù U.S. policy should be the removal of Assad even if that meant ‚Äúusing limited military coercion,‚Äù Flournoy said, at Monday‚Äôs annual CNAS conference in Washington. 
Flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased U.S. intervention; for instance, she acknowledged her support for U.S. ‚Äústrikes using standoff weapons ‚Äî to retaliate against Syrian military targets‚Äù to enforce the no-bomb zone. 
The press reports, however, did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of General Dunford and Secretary of Defense Carter at the Arms Services Committee Hearing: Let me see if the Chairman wants to add anything.
Senator Wicker: Well, let me just ask this, if you don‚Äôt mind, Secretary Carter. It would help if the barrel bombing ended. And I spoke to a Democratic colleague of mine today. I‚Äôve been calling for a no-fly zone to stop the barrel bombing, and I asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that. And he said, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúI want to call it something else, rather than a no-fly zone,‚Äù but that this particular Senator it is a fact that this particular Senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present ‚Äî to prevent the barrel bombing. 
What is your position about that? And wouldn‚Äôt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage? 
Secretary Carter: I don‚Äôt know the specific proposal which you‚Äôre discussing with your colleague. I‚Äôll make one comment and see if the Chairman wants to add anything. 
Senator Wicker: I think he was talking about a no-fly zone ‚Äì 
Secretary Carter: Well, okay. 
Senator Wicker: ‚Äî but described in more palatable terms. 
Secretary Carter: There are ‚Äî a number of different proposals have been made, but I ‚Äî the one that I think it the focus on right now is the one Secretary Kerry‚Äôs trying to promote, namely a no-fly zone for the Russians and the Syrians who are attacking the Syrian people. If they‚Äôre talking about a no-fly zone for American aircraft fighting ISIL, needless to say, that ‚Äî that‚Äôs not going to get any enthusiasm, get strong opposition from me. 
Senator Wicker: I‚Äôm speaking about a ‚Äì 
Secretary Carter: But, I think that‚Äôs what a ‚Äî but ‚Äî it‚Äôs not called that, but Secretary Kerry is trying to get a standdown of the Syrian and Russian air force. And if he‚Äôs successful, that would be a good thing. 
Let me ask the Chairman if he has anything to add. 
General Dunford: Senator, the only thing I‚Äôd say is, you know, as the situation on the ground changes, I think I have a responsibility ‚Äî we, the joint force, has a responsibility ‚Äî to make sure the President has a full range of options. We have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions. The conditions on the ground will change, and we‚Äôll continue to look at those options and make sure they‚Äôre available to the President. 
Senator Wicker: What about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped? 
General Dunford: All options ‚Äì 
Senator Wicker: What do you think of that option, sir? 
General Dunford: Right now, Senator, for all of the airspace in Syria, it would require war against Syria and Russia. That‚Äôs a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I‚Äôm not going to make.

From the above testimonies and statements, one thing is clear. Decision-makers at highest levels of the US government and the military believe in their own propaganda. They are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda. And this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a ‚Äúpeace-making operation‚Äù. 
It is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a ‚Äúno fly zone‚Äù will be taken under the Obama administration prior to the November elections and the instatement of a new president of the US in January 2017. 
Consequently, the next three months will be absolutely crucial for Syria. ‚Äìi.e. During this period, the counterterrorism campaign waged by Syria with the support of Russia and Iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country. 
The foot-soldiers of the Western military alliance will be defeated on the ground. If this objective is achieved, it will inevitably have an impact on ‚ÄúUS options‚Äù regarding the proposed deployment of ground-forces and the No Fly Zone. What prevails, however, is an attempt on the part of Washington to redeploy its ISIS terrorist foot-soldiers in Mosul by transferring them from Iraq to Syria.

Today Dr. Duke had Mark Collett from the U.K. as his guest for the hour. They talked about developments in Dr. Duke‚Äôs race for the U.S. Senate. They also talked about the media‚Äôs attempts to avoid discussing the barrage of revelations from WikiLeaks that would sink Hillary‚Äôs campaign if the media was doing its job. 
Mark Collett reported on the Muslim invasion and other developments in Europe. They also talked about the collapse of morality and culture led by this same vicious and anti-white racist Zio media.

How they could steal the election from Trump even if he is announced the winner next Tuesday 
By Dr. Patrick Slattery ‚Äî There has been a great deal of talk recently about the ‚Äúrigging‚Äù of elections. Trump talks about it, and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters. Nobody asks Hillary if she will accept the will of the voters‚Ä¶ 
Of course, we know that our electoral system is unfair, biased, and even rigged at a variety of levels. Without going into detail, the media, which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections, has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality. Ballot access is unfair. Campaign finance is corrupt. Electronic voting machines are vulnerable. Voting by foreigners and dead people exists, as does multiple voting by individuals. 
But one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned: the vulnerability of the electoral college to post-election shenanigans. 
What people are not aware of is that, under the Constitution, the president is not elected on November 8. The Tuesday after the first Monday in November is designated for Congressional elections. It just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the Electoral College selected by the voters on that day. In the early days of the Republic, it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors, and the Constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected. 
It is actually the Electoral College that elects the president, and that happens on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, which this year will be December 19. On this day, the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots, which will then be sent to Washington to be opened by Vice President Biden before a joint session of Congress on January 6 of next year. Some of you may remember the scene from Michael Moore‚Äôs Fahrenheit 911 showing Vice President Gore reading votes that elected President Bush, ironically denying the objections raised by some Congressmen to Florida‚Äôs electoral votes, which Bush won over Gore amidst the greatest of controversy. 
So if this system is enshrined in the Constitution, what could possibly go wrong? Plenty. 
Unless Hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week, a Trump victory on November 8 will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map. One very plausible scenario has Trump losing Pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of Maine‚Äôs congressional districts. (Maine, along with Nebraska, allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winner-take-all.) Under this scenario, 270 Republican electors would be elected, a bare majority, while 268 Democrat electors would be elected. 
Notice I did not say ‚ÄúTrump would get 270 electoral votes,‚Äù which is what we are used to hearing. The fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until December 19, and there is no guarantee that every single one of the 270 Republican electors would actually vote for Trump. Do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed Trump delegates to the Republican National Convention deserting Trump and voting for Cruz? It was only that Trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the Never Trump people in the Republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention. 
So who are these electors? Just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states, the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states. Some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors. Presumably, these people could be counted on to be loyal. But in other states the party‚Äôs slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions. 
As a young man I attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a Democratic elector. Myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention. The other three talked about being precinct captains or hard-working party volunteers. Then I gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college. I got a huge round of applause. I would have easily won, but as a matter of principle I withdrew my name from nomination. 
The point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public, typically cogs in the party apparatus, and not even necessarily high-level ones, and some of them may even be smooth-talking slicksters like me, unknown to the party itself. 
So how likely is it that one or more Republican electors would betray Trump? Such a person is known as a ‚Äúfaithless elector,‚Äù and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election, there have been 179 faithless electors in our history. In fact, faithless electors caused the Congress to have to decide the 1836 election for Vice President. 
It is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters, but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count. 
The nightmare situation would be after a close election the Hillary people, or the Never Trump people, could bribe or pressure Republican electors, some of whom may not like Trump anyway, not to vote for Trump. They could vote for Hillary, they could vote for Pence, they could vote for anyone else, or they could even abstain from voting. 
Then what happens? If enough Republican electors are cajoled into voting for Hillary (in the above 270-268 scenario, it would only require two), then Hillary gets inaugurated on January 20. If it‚Äôs a tie, then the House of Representatives breaks the tie. Obviously, there have been Republican members of the House that say they won‚Äôt vote for Trump for president in November, so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in January. 
However, not only are Republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the House, but the voting for president by the House is not one vote for each representative, but one vote per state. This means that California, which currently has 39 Democratic representatives, would get only one vote, while Alaska‚Äôs single representative, who is a Republican, would also get one vote. This heavily favors the Republicans and means that if Hillary cannot flip enough Republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes, she is finished. There is no real prospect of the House of Representative electing Hillary. 
But what if enough Republican electors vote for other people, Paul Ryan for example, so that no candidate gets a majority? Then the House of Representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote. You could get a coalition between Democrats and Republican defectors that would deny Trump the presidency and give it to someone like Ryan. (The same applies in the case that Mormon ex-CIA operative and never-Trump independent presidential candidate Evan McMullen wins Utah , which some polls predict is possible.) 
While none of the above scenarios may come to pass, we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat Trump, and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics, especially if the November 8 voting produces a very narrow victory for Trump. The media could start inventing more reasons why Trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the Constitution allows for these scenarios (which is the case), and that this in fact was why the framers of the Constitution created the Electoral College (which is not the case). 
It would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the Electoral College and the Congress that any violation of the people‚Äôs will would not be tolerated.";english;2016-10-31T10:59:32.036+02:00;davidduke.com;US;;How they could steal the election from Trump even if he is announced the winner next Tuesday;0.0;https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;hate

On the PBS News Hour on Friday, David Brooks said white people are ‚Äúvoting their gene pool.‚Äù Wow. Just wow. This is the same David Brooks who wrote in his New York Times column about a Jewish woman who came up to him after a speech, and knowing that he was Jewish too told him that his speech was a description of how Jews had taken over America, which he acknowledged in the column was indeed the case.One of my Jewish professors once boasted that ‚ÄúJews earn like Episcopalians but vote like Puerto Ricans.‚Äù In other words, they voted their gene pool. Of course, they eventually bought out the Republican party as well, which gave their gene pool‚Äôs vote a choice.
Blacks famously vote their gene pool. Hispanics are expected to vote their gene pool. But when whites and whites alone consider their ethnic interests in voting, it is something that Brooks and the rest of the Zio elite and their Goyish lackey find ‚Äúdeplorable.‚Äù 
Basically, less educated or high school-educated whites are going to Trump. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the guy does. And college-educated going to Clinton. 
Sometimes, you get the sense that the campaign barely matters. People are just going with their gene pool and whatever it is. And that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me. 
But what Brooks said about the reasons for whites (besides the college-indoctrinated whites) voting their gene pool was even more interesting. 
We had a lot of good things over the years that were really good for America. I think globalization has been really good for America. I think the influx of immigrants has been really good for America. Feminism has been really good for America.‚Äù 
But there are a lot of people who used to be up in society, because of those three good things, are now down, a lot of high school-educated white guys. And they have been displaced. 
When David Brooks was growing up, whites make up close to 90% of the American population. So it doesn‚Äôt really make sense to say that the displacement of the bulk of the American population is good for America. 
Of course, he did specify ‚Äúhigh school-educated white guys.‚Äù Well, were blacks helped by globalization, immigration, and feminism? What did that do for their employment rates, crime rates, illegitimacy rates, etc.? 
And white women? Well, maybe all they ever wanted in the first place was to have blue hair, nose rings, tattoos, and raise cats instead of babies. I guess we never asked them. 
And college educated white guys? Well, they used to go to Harvard and Yale. Now, with affirmative action for blacks and Hispanics, competition from Asians, and massive Jewish nepotism, a white guy is lucky to get into a second-tier state school. 
Brooks conclusion was even more breath taking: 
And shame on us for not paying attention to that and helping them out. And, therefore, as a result, what happened was, they were alienated, they got super cynical, because they really were being shafted. And so they react in an angry way. 
Well, that‚Äôs not a shock, given the last 30 or 50 years of American history. And so, for us going forward, it‚Äôs to not reverse the dynamism of American society and the diversity. It‚Äôs to pay attention to the people who are being ruined by it, and so this doesn‚Äôt happen again. 
Here he admits that whites got shafted. That we are being ruined by diversity. But the weird thing is that line about ‚Äúso this doesn‚Äôt happen again.‚Äù What? Is he concerned that Hispanics might be Jewed out of the America they inherit from whites? 
The rest of his appearance was just a poetic rant against Donald Trump. With any luck, on Tuesday Trump will be elected president, and we can make begin the process of making America America again.";english;2016-11-07T09:33:32.632+02:00;davidduke.com;US;;David Brooks: Whites are ‚Äúvoting their gene pool‚Äù after being ‚Äúruined‚Äù by globalization, immigration, and feminism;0.0;https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Today Dr. Duke had Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin as his guest for the hour. They talked about the importance of the election tomorrow. They remarked that the Clinton campaign makes baseless accusations that the Russians could hack our voting machines to manipulate the election, but then insisting that Trump is beyond the pale for suggesting that the Hillary forces could possibly rig the vote. 
They also talked about New York Times columnist David Brooks admission on the PBS News Hour that as a result of globalization, immigration, and feminism, white men in America have been ‚Äúdisplaced,‚Äù‚Äúshafted,‚Äù and ‚Äúruined,‚Äù and that their support for Trump is due to them ‚Äúgoing with their gene pool.‚Äù Brooks, a Jewish Republican, says the one person he cannot support for President is Donald Trump. 
And now, a message from Andrew Anglin: 
Meanwhile, the media is admitting that voting machines will be hacked . 
We have to overwhelm the polls tomorrow. You must get everyone you know to vote . Call them right now. Don‚Äôt wait. Go through your phonebook on your cellphone and call up every single person you know who is not a totally liberal commie, and make sure they are going to vote. Offer to give them a ride if they need it. 
Let‚Äôs do this, people.

While Hillary has been rattling the sabres for a war with Russia, the mass awakening that is occurring would hopefully lead those needed in the military to make a war happen to reject orders which could destroy civilization. 
This is a historic show for a historic day. Now go out there and vote for Trump and Duke!

Dr. MacDonald & Dr. Duke Expose the Vicious War on Trump by the Jewish Establishment! 
Today Dr. Duke had Professor Kevin MacDonald as his guest for the hour. They discussed the importance of the Trump victory as well as what needs to be done. They agreed that regarding immigration, the most important thing in the long term is repealing the 1965 Act. 
They also pointed out the phenomenon of whites voting their ethnic interests. While we have been hearing that white women were going to vote against Trump, they wound up supporting him by a 10% margin. Even almost half of white women with a college education supported Trump, despite the years of Jewish indoctrination at college. The same can be said for white millennials.

Today Dr. Duke had Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin as his guest for the hour. They talked about what needs to be done by the new Trump administration. 
They also talked about the double standards of morality applied to whites and non-whites. While whites will forever be condemned by the Jewish cultural overlords for slavery and the holocaust, the massive crimes that were perpetrated by Aztecs, Zulus, Turks, Arabs, and others during the same historical time period are completely glossed over.

Today Dr. Duke had Dr. Patrick Slattery as his guest for the hour. They discussed the Soros & Company-fueled demonstrations that are going on in cities across the United States that bear a resemblance to the ‚Äúcolor revolutions‚Äù that were used by Soros in several countries around the world to overturn the results of elections or overthrow governments that were not kosher enough. 
They talked about the media‚Äôs continuing attack on Trump. He granted an interview to 60 Minute‚Äôs Leslie Stahl, who constantly interrupted him, preventing him from answering the questions she posed to him. Trump importantly insisted that he will continue to by-pass the media and communicate directly with his supporters via social media. He also seemed to prioritize tightening the immigration law over immediately deporting all illegal aliens, which Doctors Duke and Slattery agreed was the proper strategy.

Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery show why our survival totally depends on defeat of Jewish Power! 
Today Dr. Duke focused on the threat of Jews infiltrating and taking over movements with a potential to become a base for opposing Jewish power. The Alt-Right currently includes people who are extremely critical of Jewish power and those who either ignore it or downplay it. We must be wary of establishment efforts to parachute leaders into our movement who would focus attention away from the Jewish issue, whether it be Milo or Alex Jones. 
Dr. Slattery joined the show and recounted how Jews created a culture of self criticism in the 1960s among whites and then used the resulting environment to push through an immigration act that fundamentally transformed the demographics of the country to the extent that it took a miracle for whites simply to elect the President of their choice.

Dr. David Duke offers a New Paradigm for Humanity. Read and listen to this amazing statement that will create a revolution in the concept of Human Rights. A recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its Human diversity, independence and freedom. The right of every people to preserve its culture, traditions, art forms and characteristics of society. 
A path to peace and harmonious nations and societies. Why we must resist Globalist destruction of freedom, Globalist forms of economic and financial slavery, and Globalist, Zionist wars. 
In the power of its reason, love and understanding, this declaration of Human Diversity and Freedom can be the moral engine to saving our European heritage and truly the rights of every people on Earth! The Foundation of Human Freedom 
I believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of Human diversity. I cherish not only the value of every form of life on Earth in what we call biodiversity, but also respect and honor the diversity of Mankind. I believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of Humanity, its own heritage and culture. That every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent. 
Human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different. Humanity is not one, it is many. Destroying the variety, diversity and freedom of a diverse Humanity is a destruction of Humanity itself. 
Not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art, music, culture, religion, societal structure and government, leads to Human conflict and often to violence and Human suffering on a horrific scale. 
Much of the world‚Äôs conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different, but because they are not allowed to be different! because Globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires. They want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real Human diversity. Human differences in values, cultures, economies, religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the Globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers. Human Diversity is natural 
Human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years. Whether we celebrate Human diversity as the handiwork of Nature or in a religious sense as the creation of God, we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the Earth. 
We believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of Humanity, that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture, to nurture its particular expressions of art, music, literature, philosophies, architecture, religion, diet, traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for Mankind. 
We believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent, and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation. And we reject the Globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy Human diversity. Every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom 
We believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image, its own nature and spirit. 
For example, the people of Tibet have the Human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage, culture and tradition of that nation, as should all peoples. Today the Tibetan people are threatened by massive non-Tibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of Tibetan people in their own homeland. The loss of the unique people and culture of Tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of Humanity. What is true for Tibet and the Tibetan people is true for every people on Earth. We believe that the people of Tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders, and an inherent Human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character, and its freedom and independence. 
Nations more similar in their cultural, ethnic, religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural, ethnic or religious divisions. 
We also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy, peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society. 
If one looks honestly at the world, he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict, hatreds, wars, genocide and other horrific Human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict, often accompanied by religious conflict. And when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite. 
It is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict, you must endeavor to give every people the Human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and, that every group respect the right of every other group to do this. 
We believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supra-national states and globalist denial of the reality of Human diversity and denial of the natural Human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage, traditions, culture and values. One size does not fit all. 
Instead of recognizing this reality, the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of Humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation. Instead of accepting the reality of Human nature and truly the diversity of all life, including Human life, the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations. Massive immigration of diverse peoples into another people‚Äôs living space produces conflict not harmony 
We believe that massive forced immigration of non-indigenous people into other people‚Äôs lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people. 
And this leads to civil repression, conflict, hatreds, violence. One does not have to look much further than the Palestinian Nakba, or the massive immigration into Tibet as examples of this universal truth, but this reality is just as true in Europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states. 
Look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive, unwanted immigration. 
A world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom. 
A multicultural state does not contribute to Human diversity. It does not contribute to Human happiness, peace and harmony. It more often than not lessens Human love and Human rights. No matter what the high motive, it produces more disharmony than harmony, more discord than accord. 
Just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space, and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish, so it is true for every people of Humanity. 
Every people needs a living space and eco-cultural system in which it can thrive. Ignoring this reality leads to conflict. Diverse Human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against Humanity. 
United Nations studies show ethnic, cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in Human suffering, numbering hundreds of millions of dead, injured, and dispossessed Human beings. 
This urge to diversity has always been in Mankind, and always will be. Not to recognize this elemental part of mankind‚Äôs Nature is the progenitor of conflict. 
In fact, with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free, ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression. 
Nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring Human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted. Trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide 
The global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the world‚Äôs populations, tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and Human expression . 
They attempt to change Human nature, but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide. 
Better to recognize Human nature, and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect. 
It is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the Human right of every people to exist and thrive. However, those who seek their own people‚Äôs freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people. And any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts. 
It is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of Humanity and avoid as much Human conflict as possible, than to try to destroy Human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity. Even if the destruction of people‚Äôs is based on a utopian vision, because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate. Attempts to control, exploit or harm any people is a crime against Humanity 
We must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people. We must adopt a clear Human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against Humanity. 
We support Human freedom and we support Human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society, but we do not support supremacism, control or repression of any other people. Efforts to control or exploit is a crime against Humanity. 
As a person of European descent I see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly European peopled nations that are today called the West. I see that this globalism not only damages and harms the world‚Äôs diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people. And I have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity. 
This is a life-changing lesson that I have learned in my own life. As a very young man I joined a non-violent Klan organization in my community. Like so many young people across the world, I longed to identify with my own people, to defend the heritage that I love and that I believed was threatened. 
But still as a young man I left the organization because I came to realize I have no moral right to speak about Human rights for my own people unless I embrace the idea of the same Human rights for every people, and further, that we must be committed to securing Human rights, not with war, not with violence, not with Human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals. 
I believe that the vast majority of the earth‚Äôs people believe in the principles I set forth here. In my own life I further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own people‚Äôs heritage and rights that I have for mine. 
I realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all Humanity, can one morally campaign for your own people‚Äôs fundamental rights. Defending the Diversity of Humanity is a defense of Humanity itself 
There is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage. In fact defending and preserving the diversity of Humanity is defense of Humanity itself. 
But, it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all. 
In that context and only with that understanding, can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social, religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of Humanity. 
Nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage, culture, religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of Humanity and their societal harmony. 
It is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of so-called multiculturalism. And if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples, cultures and religions lead, just look to what happened in the war-ravaged now dismembered nation once called Yugoslavia, look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in Tibet, look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the Mideast. 
Group differences run deep. Even though the Muslim Qur‚Äôan repeatedly teaches Muslim unity, still some extremist elements of Shiites and Sunnis blow up the children of each other in the other‚Äôs holy places of worship. Nor did the admonitions of Jesus Christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop Irish Catholics and Scottish-derived Protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents. 
Although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another people‚Äôs lands, we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strife-torn communities, regions and nations. Models of self rule and societal harmony 
And just as a majority has the Human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values, so minorities must be accorded their Human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence, or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots. 
This is Human freedom and this is Human rights on the most fundamental level. Those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression. 
Autonomy within nations, such as the German language speaking South Tyrol region of North Italy and the Italian, French and German-speaking Cantons of Switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language, heritage, ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric. 
Nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people. 
Even European nations divided by slight differences in history, identity, genetics and culture, seek this freedom. The artificially created nation of Czechoslovakia was composed of Czechs and Slovaks held together by 50 years of intense totalitarian physical suppression, propaganda and conditioning. 
When the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. 
They did this with mutual respect and not war, and without horrific crimes against Humanity. 
Contrast that to the artificially created state of Yugoslavia created in name of empire, and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime. When Communism fell, people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples. As a result, a long war and brutality and massive crimes against Humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict. 
How much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions. Take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old Yugoslavia, the Serbians and the Croatians. Even though Serbians may have dominated the government of Yugoslavia, to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity. 
So even the Serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled. People now warmly embrace the right of Serbians and Croatians to be themselves and rule themselves. Globalism is a continuation of Yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale 
Ironically, the Serbians and the Croatians and indeed all of us, face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of Serbia and Croatia, their currencies, controlled by New York and London rather than by their own people, and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by Hollywood and New York rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values. 
And in the height of insanity, the Globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both Serbia and Croatia of massive numbers of non-European immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than Serbs and Croats. A prescription for future Human conflict. The rights of both majorities and minorities 
There are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage, with only minor differences among their inhabitants. 
But, nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite, and propagandized that Humanity is one and not many go against the people‚Äôs will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population. 
This process is almost always against the democratic will of the nation‚Äôs inhabitants as history repeatedly shows. And then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase, the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech, free association, and all kinds of Human liberty, even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority. 
A powerful example is how the American government has now made it illegal to display a Christian Christmas motif on public ground, even in an overwhelmingly Christian cultural nation. America supposedly created by e pluribus unum (out of the many, one) is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics. 
The most powerful lobby in American politics by far is, for instance, the Jewish Lobby, comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the American people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism. Jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of Christian Christmas traditions. 
The political landscape of America is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow, except of course the European American majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions, such as Christmas are destroyed. Of course, it goes far beyond Christmas. Americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration. The rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed 
On the international level it must be recognized as a crime against Humanity for any imperial state to occupy another people‚Äôs lands for exploitation of its labor or resources. Where autonomy or independent regions are not possible, a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions, schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit. 
It is time to stand for freedom for all peoples. It is time to stand up to Globalist destruction of biodiversity, destruction of Human diversity, destruction of the earth‚Äôs indigenous cultures, artistic expressions, lifestyles, traditions and independence. Zionist Globalism is actually supremacism 
The globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of Humanity. They want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth. 
They seek to destroy the Human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us, and market the same brands of junk movies, media and music. They want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it, that not only destroys the planet‚Äôs ecosystems, but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity, heart disease, diabetes and other ills. 
They want to control the value of the currency in your pocket, and force you and your nation under a corrupt Zionist-controlled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt. 
They want to put you and all of us under a soulless, Globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation. 
And these globalists want war, perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people. 
They grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics, and they seek to stamp out Human diversity and seek to regiment all of Humanity to their New World Order all while the New York centered Globalist media supports Israel as a quote ‚ÄúJewish State‚Äù, and supports Zionist control of the International Banks and the Globalist media. So in reality, Zionist-Driven Globalism is actually form of Jewish supremacism. 
Globalism is Imperialism on a global level, and the greatest threat to human freedom, diversity and independence in all of world history. Yes to Freedom, yes to Diversity and Independence 
But, my dear friends all over the world, in my homeland of America and that of my brethren in Europe, but among all freedom loving people across the globe, millions of us say no to globalism. 
We say yes to freedom, yes to Human diversity and independence. 
We say no to globalist wars such as the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, the planned war on Iran, horrific wars that are part of the Zionist, Globalist agenda. 
We say no to the Zionist dominated Globalist media that spout the lies that fuel these wars. 
We say yes to a free Internet and the freedom of people create their own media, literature, music and art forms. No longer will we drink the toxic poisons of the Globalist elite. 
We say no to Globalism, yes to Human freedom, yes to Human diversity, yes to world of peace and prosperity. 
We say yes to every people‚Äôs striving to preserve their way of life, their particular heritage, their particular expression of Humanity. 
Whether we are Kurds, or Pakistanis, or Iranians or Palestinians. Whether we are Chinese, or Japanese, or Africans or Indians or of European heritage, we say no to globalism. 
We say yes to Human Freedom and Global Diversity. We say yes to the peoples of our own nations and societies determining our destiny. 
We say no to the Global corporations and huge imperial powers wiping out Human diversity in pursuit of their ungodly power. We say yes to preserving our heritage and our way of life, yes to our independence and freedom no matter who we are or where we live upon the earth. 
We are Humanity. We are many. 
Because we honor our own heritage and traditions, we honor every heritage and tradition. 
Because we value our own freedom and independence we value the freedom and independence of every people on Earth. 
Because we refuse to be economically exploited we pledge not to exploit other s. 
Just as most Europeans now want to preserve their own heritage and cultures, we refuse to support the Globalists who seek to use us to control and exploit other nations around the world. 
Because we love peace, we refuse to support their Zionist-driven globalist wars. A New Paradigm of Human Rights 
This is a new affirmation of Human rights, a new paradigm. It is the Human freedom movement and it is found wherever there are free people who desire to preserve their heritage and freedom. 
It is found where people yearn for Human societies allowed to be as naturally diverse as the biodiversity in Nature. 
The Globalists have global economic, media political and military power. But we represent the true desires of Humanity for freedom. 
We represent the natural desires of every majority population to want to preserve the character of their nation and people, and every minority population who seeks more freedom and autonomy in their own communities or regions. Human Diversity, Freedom and Independence 
We must resist rule of the Globalists over us with a Global coalition of mutually free peoples. 
We are rising in every nation. 
Our Paradigm for Human Freedom and Diversity is growing among people all over the world. 
The Globalists cannot rule over us without our consent. They cannot defeat us if we rise in defense of Human freedom and diversity, not just for ourselves but as a new principle for all Mankind, good for all people on this planet. 
The principles we stand for we hold, for our own people and for every people on the face the Earth. 
This is the world I am committed to, the Humanity I am committed to, the nation in my own land that I am committed to. 
I hope you join me in this quest for a new paradigm for Humanity, a new commitment to Human freedom and diversity.

Today Dr. Duke addressed the attack on him by MSNBC‚Äôs Lawrence O‚ÄôDonnell (over-paid shill) and Anti-Defamation League Chairman Jonathan Greenblat (professional Jewish censorship overlord) on Dr. Duke‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄúJewish supremacist‚Äù to describe Senator Barbara Boxer.

Dr. Slattery joined the show and pointed out hypocrisy of people like Jonathan Greenblat calling for Donald Trump not to appoint Steve Bannon to his administration over allegations that he did not want to his kids to go to school with Jews when so many of Greenblat‚Äôs own staff at the ADL send their kids to Jewish-only day schools.

Trump appoints men who will take America back! 
President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs appointment of Bannon Flynn, and Sessions are the first steps in the long and arduous project of taking America back. 
Trump Chief Strategist Bannon has repeatedly exposed the vicious war on White people on his Breitbart website. 
National Security Head Flynn realizes that America‚Äôs foreign policy has been downright traitorous with the support of the radical Jihadists of Saudi Arabia, over our natural allies the Christian, Muslim and moderate secularists of Syria. He also understands that Putin of ‚ÄúChristian Russia‚Äù should not be our enemy but our ally. He is an avowed enemy of the Jewish warmonger traitors called ‚ÄúNeocons‚Äù and they in turn intensely hate this U.S. Army General who truly puts America First. 
Attorney General Sessions has been hated for years by the Jewish-dominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into America and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive, institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action. 
During his U.S. Senate confirmation hearings Senators should demand that he expose the blatant media and political blather of ‚Äúequal rights and opportunity‚Äù when white people face massive racial discrimination as well as a media hate campaign against the people whose ancestors created America! 
We must demand the protection of the civil rights of all Americans including white people! Everyone must be judged on their merit and not the unfair and destructive anti-white affirmative action racist policies that dominate major corporations, Federal, State, and city governments, colleges and educational institutions.

An article in the Jewish Daily Forward newspaper has claimed that ‚ÄúJewish charities‚Äù give more money to Israel than they do to education, and that this figure is of the order of $26 billion. As Professor Kevin McDonald points out in this article below, this figure is actually not even the real total‚Äîit is considerably more. As he points out, this figure does not include what is collected at synagogues‚Äîand then given to Israel‚Äîeach month, because synagogues, schools and seminaries are not required to file tax returns. This is of real importance for everyone who wishes to understand how the Jewish lobby in America works, and how it uses American money‚Äîand taxpayers‚Äîto keep the racist Jews-only state of Israel in business. The immense wealth of the Jewish lobby is not the product of ‚ÄúJewish ingenuity‚Äù‚Äîit is the product of active discrimination in favor of Jews by other Jews‚Äîin the educational system, the economy and in the media. Forward Study of the Jewish Charity Industry By Professor Kevin MacDonald. The $26 billion dollar figure in the title refers to the net assets of the network of explicitly Jewish charitable organizations, which puts it in the same league as a major corporation. Annual revenue is around $12-14 billion. Assuming an American Jewish population of around 6.4 million, this implies assets per capita of over $4000 and per capita annual giving of around half that. Based on an older survey indicating 2.3 persons per Jewish household, annual giving per household would be around $4600. These numbers are certainly not earth shaking, but, when broken down to particular categories, they indicate that Jewish activist organizations are indeed well funded, especially when compared to the financial resources of organizations that oppose Jewish interests (probably well under $1 million for organizations explicitly dedicated to advancing the interests of White Americans). For example, 6% of the $3.7 billion in annual donations for ‚Äúfunctional charities‚Äù is allocated for ‚ÄúGeneral Advocacy‚Äù ($222,000,000 annually), and 38% goes to Israel-related causes ($1.4 billion annually). Advocacy presumably includes the ADL which reported revenue of over $53 million in 2012‚Äîenough to fund over $31 million in employee salaries (including Abe Foxman at $688,188 ) and 28 regional offices. That‚Äôs a lot of power in opposition to European interests given the virtual non-existence of organizations explicitly dedicated to furthering European identification and interests. These numbers for donations to Jewish charity are underestimates because the IRS doesn‚Äôt require synagogues to file tax returns, and the same goes for schools and seminaries. As a result, ‚Äúthe $12 billion to $14 billion in annual revenue, the Forward‚Äôs best estimate based on tax filings, is probably billions of dollars short of the network‚Äôs actual size.‚Äù The other way in which such a report fails to get at the scope of financial support for Jewish ethnic activism is that it does not include organizations that are not explicitly Jewish but are supported by Jews for ethnic reasons. As Norman Podhoretz notes, Jews are the financial engine of the left, but of course the vast majority of charity for leftist causes would not appear in the Forward article because they are not explicitly Jewish organizations. A good example is the SPLC which is largely Jewish-funded but would not be considered a Jewish communal organization. (In 2012 the SPLC reported revenue of over $37 million and salaries of over $16 million.) Or consider the neocon infrastructure, such as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies: All of the identifiable donors are Jews, including a host of well-known Jewish activists like Edgar M. Bronfman ($1,050,000) and Michael Steinhardt ($850,000) who co-founded the Birthright Israel program that brings Jewish young people to Israel for a dose of Jewish patriotism. The same goes for the Republicans and Democrats, where Jewish funding promotes Israel and the liberal/left values of the Jewish community (likely at least 60% of Democrat funding, and at least 40% of Republican). For example, Haim Saban has donated millions to the Democrats, and right now ‚ÄúRepublicans who are considering a run for president are courting Sheldon Adelson [who donated more than $100 million to Republicans in the last presidential election cycle] as a preliminary to everything else they must do to prove their worthiness, like kissing babies in Iowa or formulating a position on jobs.‚Äù And anyone with a half a brain knows that Adelson‚Äôs support begins and ends with what the candidate will do for Israel. Ditto for David Gelfand‚Äôs donation of more than $100 million to the Sierra Club on condition that it adopt a view on immigration in sync with the views of the organized Jewish community. (My gloss, but it‚Äôs hard to believe that his donation did not reflect the typical Jewish commitment to displacement-level immigration). In other words, a lot of the most destructive Jewish funding is not included in these figures. And even though the donations to the explicitly Jewish organizations covered by the article are only the tip of the iceberg, there is no suggestion that the Jewish community is highly mobilized at this time, as indicated by the per capita data. A crisis in Israel would lead to a huge upsurge of Jewish funding, as it did during the 1967 and 1973 wars ‚Äî as would any indication that European Americans are beginning to develop a sense of racial identity and beginning to assert their interests by developing explicitly European organizations which have the wherewithal to make a difference.;english;2016-11-20T16:38:36.464+02:00;davidduke.com;US;;$26 Billion Dollars for the Jewish Lobby: Just the Tip of the Iceberg;0.0;http://davidduke.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/charities-featured.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;hate

The New Observer March 2, 2016 
More than 17,000 ‚Äúunaccompanied alien minors‚Äù had invaded the US over the Mexican border in the past few months, and the number of ‚Äúfamily units‚Äù has increased to 21,000, the US House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security has been informed. 
The House was also told that if the present trends continue, there will be a 30 percent increase on the record number of 260,000 invaders who entered the US in 2014. 
‚ÄúIn the past few months the number of unaccompanied alien minors unlawfully entering the US soared to over 17,000 and the number of family units increased to 21,000,‚Äù Chair Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) informed the US House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security in a February 4 hearing on Capitol Hill. 
‚ÄúIf these trends continue it is predicted there will be a 30 percent increase in the record high numbers we witnessed in 2014.‚Äù 
The widespread criminal violence endemic in the nonwhite Third World countries to the south continues to be a major factor in the ongoing invasion, Omar Zamora, public affairs officer for the US Border Patrol Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector told the local KVUE TV station. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got gangs over there that are controlling the neighborhoods, controlling the cities,‚Äù Zamora said. 
Agents of the RRGV Sector, he said, ‚Äúman the front lines of the battle against drug trafficking and human smuggling.‚Äù 
The US government has mounted an ad campaign along the Guatemala‚ÄìHonduras border warning would-be invaders what to expect from human traffickers. 
According to Zamora, the human traffickers engage in everything from child molestation and rape to extortion and fraud. READ Cologne Police Officer Confirms: It was ‚ÄúRefugees‚Äù 
‚ÄúI think the biggest misconceptions are, ‚ÄòHey they‚Äôre just children down there, right? It‚Äôs a humanitarian crisis,‚Äô‚Äù said Zamora, ‚ÄúBut what I want to stress is there‚Äôs the 50 percent of the other individuals that are running, that are fighting, that have criminal records.‚Äù

Titled ‚Äú Stalin‚Äôs Jews ‚Äù and written by Jewish columnist Sever Plocker, this piece confirmed that terrible crimes which Jewish Communists had committed under Stalin. ‚ÄúWe must not forget that some of greatest murderers of modern times were Jewish,‚Äù Plocker started out by saying. He went on to make a number of startling confessions: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a particularly forlorn historical date: Almost 90 years ago, between the 19th and 20th of December 1917, in the midst of the Bolshevik revolution and civil war, Lenin signed a decree calling for the establishment of The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, also known as Cheka. ‚ÄúWithin a short period of time, Cheka became the largest and cruelest state security organization. Its organizational structure was changed every few years, as were its names: From Cheka to GPU, later to NKVD, and later to KGB. ‚ÄúWe cannot know with certainty the number of deaths Cheka was responsible for in its various manifestations, but the number is surely at least 20 million, including victims of the forced collectivization, the hunger, large purges, expulsions, banishments, executions, and mass death at Gulags. ‚ÄúWhole population strata were eliminated: Independent farmers, ethnic minorities, members of the bourgeoisie, senior officers, intellectuals, artists, labor movement activists, ‚Äúopposition members‚Äù who were defined completely randomly, and countless members of the Communist party itself. ‚ÄúIn his new, highly praised book The War of the World, Historian Niall Ferguson writes that no revolution in the history of mankind devoured its children with the same unrestrained appetite as did the Soviet revolution. In his book on the Stalinist purges, Tel Aviv University‚Äôs Dr. Igal Halfin writes that Stalinist violence was unique in that it was directed internally. ‚ÄúLenin, Stalin, and their successors could not have carried out their deeds without wide-scale cooperation of disciplined ‚Äòterror officials,‚Äô cruel interrogators, snitches, executioners, guards, judges, perverts, and many bleeding hearts who were members of the progressive Western Left and were deceived by the Soviet regime of horror and even provided it with a kosher certificate. ‚ÄúAnd us, the Jews? An Israeli student finishes high school without ever hearing the name Genrikh Yagoda, the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, the GPU‚Äôs deputy commander and the founder and commander of the NKVD. ‚ÄúYagoda diligently implemented Stalin‚Äôs collectivization orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. ‚ÄúHis Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system. After Stalin no longer viewed him favorably, Yagoda was demoted and executed, and was replaced as chief hangman in 1936 by Yezhov, the ‚Äúbloodthirsty dwarf.‚Äù The Jew Genrikh Yagoda, director of the NKVD, the Soviet Union‚Äôs Stalin-era security and intelligence agency. ‚ÄúYezhov was not Jewish but was blessed with an active Jewish wife. In his book Stalin: Court of the Red Star, Jewish historian Sebag Montefiore writes that during the darkest period of terror, when the Communist killing machine worked in full force, Stalin was surrounded by beautiful, young Jewish women. ‚ÄúStalin‚Äôs close associates and loyalists included member of the Central Committee and Politburo Lazar Kaganovich. Montefiore characterizes him as the ‚Äúfirst Stalinist‚Äù and adds that those starving to death in Ukraine, an unparalleled tragedy in the history of human kind, did not move Kaganovich. ‚ÄúMany Jews sold their soul to the devil of the Communist revolution and have blood on their hands for eternity. We‚Äôll mention just one more: Leonid Reichman, head of the NKVD‚Äôs special department and the organization‚Äôs chief interrogator, who was a particularly cruel sadist. Yagoda (center) inspecting the construction of the Moscow-Volga canal, built by slave labor from the Gulags. ‚ÄúIn 1934, according to published statistics, 38.5 percent of those holding the most senior posts in the Soviet security apparatuses were of Jewish origin. Even if we deny it, we cannot escape the Jewishness of ‚Äòour hangmen,‚Äô who served the Red Terror with loyalty and dedication from its esta blishment. After all, others will always remind us of their origin.‚Äù The Gulags: Jewish-Run Concentration Camps As mentioned above, the infamous Soviet Gulags were under the direct control of the Jew Yagoda. He was not the only such Jew involved in the running of these camps, in which millions were interned and nearly 1.4 million died. The most famous revelation about the Jewish nature of the Gulags was that of famous dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Speaking from personal experience as a Gulag prisoner, Solzhenitsyn gave a candid account of Jews in charge of the Soviet prison camps in his book, Two Hundred Years Together. According to his observations, Jews made up a clear preponderance in the Gulag administration and in the early Bolshevist government, saying that of the 22 ministers in the first Soviet government three were Russian, one Georgian, one Armenian and 17 were Jews. In addition, he points out, from personal experience once again, that ‚Äútwo thirds of the Kiev Cheka‚Äù (secret police) were Jews. In 1937, another book appeared in Germany called Jewish-Run Concentration Camps in the Soviet Union, which revealed that Communist Jews were the commandants of 11 out of the 12 main Gulags.;english;2016-11-21T20:36:47.659+02:00;davidduke.com;US;;The Greatest Mass Murderers of all Time were Jews, says Jewish Columnist;0.0;http://davidduke.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/yagoda560.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Tulsi Gabbard for Secretary of State! An example of the need for political realignment 
By Dr. Patrick Slattery ‚Äî On Monday Donald Trump met with Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. She has been mentioned as a possible Secretary of State, or even Secretary of Defense (she is an Iraq War combat veteran and Major in the Hawaii National Guard). It‚Äôs not just that she would be preferable in these jobs to John Bolton, Rudi Giuliani, or Mitt Romney, but is probably the very best candidate from the ranks of the Washington establishment. 
In particular, she is unique in being a strong and principled opponent of any intervention in Syria. She wants the United States to stop supporting ISIS and other ‚Äúrebel‚Äù groups and let the Russians, Iranians, and Hezbollah help President Assad defeat the jihadists and end the Syrian Civil War (which is more an armed invasion than a real civil war). This is exactly the right approach. 
And it‚Äôs not just that she is on the right side of this issue. It is her signature issue. She is on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees, so this is what she has spent her time on. 
It‚Äôs not that she‚Äôs perfect. It has been noted that she at the very least pays lip-service to Israel. Everyone on Capital Hill does. Let‚Äôs face it, Zionism is the established religion in America, and there IS a religious test for office. But her fault goes further than that. She condemned the government of then-Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovich in February 2014, just as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs erstwhile Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was organizing his overthrow. Gabbard, like everyone else in Congress, then supported arming the Jewish-dominated government that Nuland put in place in Kiev. 
Even so, her Congressional website does not carry any mention of Ukraine since 2014, and her vocal opposition to starting World War III with Russia over Syria seems to indicate that her view towards Russia have become more realistic. This, as has been noted elsewhere, is in line with Trump‚Äôs view. 
But there is one more significant benefit of appointing Gabbard as Secretary of State. It could help trigger a badly needed realignment of American politics. As people like Ralph Nader have long been telling us, there is no significant difference between Democrats and Republicans. That is because the most divisive issues in politics are not the existential issues that face our society and the world. 
If there has been one litmus test in politics during my lifetime it has been abortion. It may engender strong emotions, but it hardly ranks with nuclear war as a threat to humanity. Yet I cannot tell you how many staunchly anti-war people in 2004 voted for pro-war Democrat John Kerry because they were worried about Bush appointing pro-life judges to the Supreme Court. Talk about getting your priorities backwards! 
This year, despite senior statesmen like Mikhail Gorbachev warning us that the threat of a nuclear World War III has never been higher, foreign policy was all but absent from the campaign. Only non-mainstream elements like the paleo-conservatives, the Alt-Right, Greens, and stray individuals from the old left like Stephen F. Cohen managed to finally get it injected into the campaign just in the nick of time. In such a close election, one could certainly make the case that this made the difference. 
At this point in time, war has to be the top priority. As important as immigration may be, what difference will it make in a post-apocalyptic Mad Max world? (Of course, if we could organize around opposing Jewish power, it would take care of war, but far too few people are awake enough to make this possible. In fact, Israel currently has no role as an organizing feature in America‚Äôs political alignment as both parties so unanimously support it blindly.) But as the realignment proceeds along an America First non-interventionist foreign policy, an America First immigration policy is a natural outcome. 
If Trump embraces Gabbard and rejects the neocons and their goy toys like Mitt Romney, it would really help clarify the sides in this struggle. Party labels mean nothing. Romney and Ryan and the like already revealed themselves by opposing Trump. There are tons of people outside of the Republican Party who could conceivably rally around Trump‚Äôs foreign and other policies, and it is imperative that The Donald make a point of bringing in some of these people into high profile positions while visibly snubbing his true enemies from within the Republican Party.";english;2016-11-24T12:45:38.117+02:00;davidduke.com;US;;Tulsi Gabbard for Secretary of State!

Dr. Duke Lauds White Hero Richard Spencer, the NPI and the True Alt Right! 
Today Dr. Duke applauded National Policy Institute director Richard Spencer for having staged a conference in a major venue in Washington D.C. that focused on white interests and specifically discussed Jewish power as a threat to white interests. Having crossed the boundary into the taboo realm of Jewish power, Spencer is now under vicious attack from not only the mainstream media, but from some segments of the ‚Äúalternative media‚Äù that are revealing themselves as nothing more that Zionist tools. 
Dr. Slattery joined the show and commented on the significance of someone with the visibility of Spencer, someone with the ability to stage a major conference, addressing the reality of Jewish power. 
This show will open your eyes to the amazing progress that we are making. Please share it widely.

Many neuroscientists estimate that as much as 98% of all brain activity is unconscious. Just think about that for a second ‚Äì 98%. 
All that unconscious activity is influenced heavily by the world around its subconscious cues. To demonstrate that, we‚Äôre going to call on a super cool quiz. The premise is simple; only geniuses and schizophrenics can answer the following three questions. Which one are you? Continue to find out! 
There are no hints! You either know it or you don‚Äôt! 
The test you‚Äôve just done relies on what researchers call the ‚Äòcontraposition method.‚Äô This method tests the extent of a person‚Äôs awareness and brain processing power. It‚Äôs a super complicated method with tons of ‚Äòmoving parts,‚Äô so to speak, but here‚Äôs what you need to know for the purpose of this article: There are objects which one can reasonably say are unrelated. Most people would assume, for example, that a race car and a hurricane have very little connection. A genius who thinks outside of the box, however, would deduce some sort of connection. A schizophrenic patient would also deduce a connection because of the way the illness makes people see non-existent connections in just about everything. In other words, if the quiz in this article left you scratching your head, you‚Äôre normal. If not, one of two things is true ‚Äì you‚Äôre brilliant, or you have schizophrenia. 
Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt leave you guessing. Here are some facts that will help you figure out which one you are: Geniuses will have taken their time to think before blurting a response. Did you get the answers right? What do you think ‚Äì are you a schizophrenic or a genius? As far as the schizophrenia angle goes, this post is not a diagnostic tool. It can get you thinking about schizophrenia and, if you have concerns, you can see a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation.

Brooding and bearded face shadowed by an odd hat, cutlass scars on his arms and a dark patch where his eye ought to be. The pirate is a familiar stereotype. Countless movies have worn him down to a smooth and unremarkable cliche. 
But what if that cliche has depths that have yet to be mined by the movie industry? 
That is the question that Israeli-American director Arnon Z. Shorr (Blood and Stone: A Legend of the Golem, A Modest Suggestion, Glimpse) has chosen to tap into with the Pirate Captain Toledano . Beneath the pirate's hat hides another sort of hat. A Jewish one. For the Pirate Captain Toledano is a Jewish pirate. What sort of Jew becomes a pirate and why? 
Touching on true history, that is one of the questions that Shorr's film proposes to answer. 
Recent years have seen growing interest in the history of Jewish pirates. And what initially seems absurd quickly becomes a fascinating exploration of how much of history is lost when legend becomes cliche. As a pioneering filmmaker, Arnon Z. Shorr has chosen to tackle this ambitious project with the aid of two vessels at the Ocean Institute, a dedicated cast and support from the public. 
Though the process of bringing the Pirate Captain Toledano from vision to reality has only begun, the journey has already been marked by fortuitous coincidences, including the discovery that cast member Stephen DeCordova (Captain Toledano) hailed from ancestors who were Jewish pirates and a treasured Kiddush cup in his possession, which likely dates back from those days, will play a key role in the story. 
Like the ocean, history has unseen depths and strange currents that can only be glimpsed from the right angle. Arnon Z. Shorr is currently laboring to bring up a lost piece of history from the deeps.";english;2016-10-27T04:21:35.434+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/shooting_crowdfunding_video267.jpg?itok=hKpgo1cI;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Another great video from Project Veritas that shows you just how blurred the lines between politics and organized crime have become. 
The latest of the Project Veritas videos shows once again that it's all one integrated system, despite any protests to the contrary. The same Democratic machine that spouts off about ""dark money"" lives on it, breathes it and thrives on it. And will take it no matter how dark and dubious it is, whether it's routed from foreign interests, through foreign institutions and through roundabout ways. 
The system runs of money, on power and favors traded and influence bought and sold. For all the leftist politics on the surface, beneath the waters is the murkier tide in which folks like the Clintons swim. It's the dark water in which money gets you access to Hillary or Obama. In which the royal courts of the royal left are filled with power brokers who do the things that make the money move around.";english;2016-10-27T04:50:26.351+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;"Project Veritas: ""I've Known the President Since He Was a Community Organizer in Chicago""";0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/pro.png?itok=4v_-WCi_;0;1;0;0;0;hate

October 27, 2016 Matthew Vadum 
Democrat Hillary Clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, according to top Democrats appearing in undercover video. 
In the third Hillary-related video released by ACORN slayer James O‚ÄôKeefe and his Project Veritas Action Fund this past Sunday (Oct. 23), Clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use Donald Duck to mock Trump and troll his supporters at Trump campaign rallies. 
Among Disney cartoon characters Donald Duck was a natural choice. After all, his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when Bill and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs favorite community organizing group, the now-defunct ACORN, hired hobos and felons to go on voter-registration drives. 
Earlier this year Democrats in Donald Duck costumes started appearing at Trump events across America. Costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs. One said, ‚ÄúTrump ducks releasing his tax return.‚Äù 
This cutesy publicity stunt isn‚Äôt necessarily the problem, though. The problem is that Hillary Clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a tax-exempt nonprofit group. 
Prominent in the video is political organizer Robert Creamer who is very high up in the Democratic Party‚Äôs hierarchy. He has reportedly visited the Obama White House 342 times, including 47 meetings with Obama personally. 
One of the visits took place in Obama‚Äôs personal living quarters. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very big deal that Creamer visited the president‚Äôs residence in the White House,‚Äù a former senior White House employee told FrontPage in an interview. ‚ÄúWhite House employees can work there for years and never visit the residence.‚Äù 
Creamer, a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by Marxist community organizing guru Saul Alinsky, is husband tof Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a socialist and advocate of single-payer health care. Creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of Obamacare. He also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison. Prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for 37 months but he got off with merely five months and 11 months of home confinement from a friendly Democrat judge. 
Creamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm Democracy Partners . The list of ‚Äúpartners‚Äù on the company‚Äôs website is a who‚Äôs who of elite Democratic Party power players. 
In addition to Creamer, the partners are: 
Midwest Academy founder Heather Booth ; website developer Marc Cerabona ; organizer Wyatt Closs ; SEIU veteran Mac D‚ÄôAlessandro ; Maccabee Group founder Brett C. Di Resta ; CrossCurrents Foundation co-founder Ken Grossinger ; former Media Matters for America online organizer David Grossman ; former SEIU national field director for politics John Hennelly ; strategic communications advisor Marilyn Katz ; organizer Jackie Kendall ; strategist Lupe Lopez ; political consultant Mike Lux ; strategic advisor Josie Mooney ; consultant Patrick Pannett ; organizer Christine Pelosi (her mother is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi); USAction president Khalid Pitts ; former DNC general counsel Joe Sandler ; consultant Linda Saucedo ; fundraiser Renee Schaeffer ; former New Organizing Institute senior fellow Joel Silberman ; and organizer Cheri Whiteman . 
Listed as ‚Äúassociates‚Äù are Lauren Windsor , executive director of American Family Voices, and Aaron Black , who appears in the undercover videos. Black describes himself in the footage as ‚Äúbasically deputy rapid response director for the DNC on the ground at Trump events,‚Äù adding ‚Äúnobody‚Äôs supposed to know about me.‚Äù 
(FrontPage published an article yesterday examining Democracy Partners.) 
For a master practitioner of fascistic tactics, Creamer is amazingly lacking in self-awareness (or just plain dishonest). He wrote a fatuous, ahistorical op-ed in the Huffington Post earlier this year titled ‚ÄúCan Fascism Triumph in America?‚Äù 
‚ÄúLike other fascist movements, Trump says out loud -- and legitimates -- the kind of hateful, violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of people's living rooms.‚Äù 
Bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of Trump‚Äôs public statements, Creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents. 
Fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist Third Reich did, using the Sturmabteiling or S.A., also called brown shirts and storm troopers. Ditto for Mussolini‚Äôs Squadristi (black shirts), Mao‚Äôs Red Guards, Iran‚Äôs Basij , and Haiti‚Äôs Tonton Macoute . 
Creamer explains the Donald Duck action in the third video. 
‚ÄúIn the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,‚Äù Creamer says in one of several exchanges. ‚ÄúSo, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.‚Äù 
Creamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm, Democracy Partners, and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt repeat that to anybody.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe whole duck thing? That came about, the reason we moved it from DNC to [Americans United for Change] was to just do a hopscotch, but the actual idea was hatched way back in May,‚Äù Creamer associate Scott Foval said, making a pun. 
‚ÄúThe duck has to be an Americans United for Change entity,‚Äù Creamer said. ‚ÄúThis had to do only with some problem between [now acting DNC chief] Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. That‚Äôs why. It‚Äôs really silly.‚Äù 
We originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck. In any case, so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff, so that was fine. So, we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage. And Trump taxes. And then ABC/Disney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was ‚ÄòDonald ducks his taxes, releasing his tax returns.‚Äô 
Creamer is shown in the video hoping Disney would file a lawsuit against Democrats for using Donald Duck in the campaign, likely because such a thing would generate publicity. 
‚ÄúLet them sue us. Please God,‚Äù he says, looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer. ‚ÄúI doubt they will because we‚Äôre paying to rent or buy the suits, that‚Äôs where they get their license fees. We‚Äôre not using it for commercial purposes.‚Äù 
The Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 18 that ‚Äò‚ÄúDonald ducks‚Äô was the creation of the Democratic National Committee.‚Äù Then on Sept. 8 the paper reported the DNC ‚Äúis no longer associated with the duck ‚Ä¶ Americans United for Change is now managing the duck ‚Ä¶‚Äù 
But out of public view the DNC and the Clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation, breaking federal campaign coordination laws, O‚ÄôKeefe says in narrating the third video. 
‚ÄúWe kind of divvy up responsibilities. So sometimes it will be, like, campaign owned,‚Äù said Jenna Price, assistant press secretary at the DNC. ‚ÄúSo sometimes you will see that they advised something, or they are taking credit for things. So, like, we aren‚Äôt taking credit for the duck anymore. That‚Äôs like, random ally groups. But it‚Äôs still something that we‚Äôre involved in.‚Äù 
Brad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change, expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence. ‚ÄúI think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere.‚Äù 
In one segment, Foval says, ‚ÄúI almost got punched on Monday morning, I mean, I was in a duck costume.‚Äù 
The nation‚Äôs campaign coordination laws were enacted after President Richard Nixon‚Äôs Watergate scandal, O‚ÄôKeefe notes. 
For an activity to violate the law it must meet a three-part test, he explains. 
First, there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for election-related activity. Second, a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group. And third, electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election. 
O‚ÄôKeefe continues: 
The payment [prong of the test] is complicated but just the fact that Foval, a paid employee of Americans United for Change, was the duck at some events constitutes payment by AUfC. Conduct, based on their own admission the campaign, Creamer, their agent, and AUfC coordinated the duck activities. And finally content. ‚ÄòDonald ducks‚Äô is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another. 
The fourth video, released yesterday, isn‚Äôt so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of Creamer‚Äôs ties to the Clinton campaign and to President Obama himself. 
In a phone call Creamer says ‚ÄúI spend most of my time overseeing the Trump events around the country. I mean, that‚Äôs what I do for the Clinton campaign, uh, so that‚Äôs interesting as well.‚Äù 
In another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in Syria, Creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to Obama's inner circle. 
I just need to, I will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then. Okay? ‚Ä¶ On the first, well, I‚Äôll just talk, the guy I‚Äôm going to talk to first, to see if this is up his alley, the first thing is up his alley. It‚Äôs the guy who ran the campaign for President Obama. He has a firm that‚Äôs pretty well connected. 
In another setting, Creamer says: 
Here‚Äôs what I do for the Clinton campaign by the way. I‚Äôm a consultant to the Clinton campaign. Wherever Trump or Pence go in the country, we make sure that there are press events in the TV market or whatever ‚Ä¶ whether they‚Äôre big turnouts or little turnouts, whatever, that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message. So that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places. So our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day. So it is a lot of events, and we try and help define the other candidate. 
‚ÄúEvery morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters,‚Äù added Creamer. 
He continued: 
I‚Äôm in this campaign mainly to deal with what, you know, earned media, with the television, radio. With earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising. There would be a whole different advertising ‚Ä¶ everybody is driven on the same tracks, though. So then there are a couple, a bunch of people in the Brooklyn office [of the Clinton campaign] that are responsible for possible aspects of communication. Like, we do rapid response and there is a guy there I work with heavily, is the guy that I was just communicating with on that kind of stuff. For instance, we just found, I just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said, ‚ÄòMy understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about Trump this afternoon.‚Äô 
Creamer bragged again about his ties to President Obama. 
Oh Barack Obama‚Äôs was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. 
Obama is ‚Äúa pro,‚Äù Creamer said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago.‚Äù 
I was just at an event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the, the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues. 
The second video , released Oct. 18, was a primer on how Democrats get away with massive voter fraud. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very easy thing for Republicans to say, well they‚Äôre bussing people in,‚Äù said Scott Foval, then national field director for Americans United for Change. 
Well you know what? We‚Äôve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin‚Äô assholes for 50 years and we‚Äôre not going to stop now ‚Äì we‚Äôre just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If we needed people out there we‚Äôd bus people out to Iowa. 
In a discussion O‚ÄôKeefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally, Foval, who also worked as deputy political director at George Soros-funded People for the American Way (PfAW), explains how to get away with voter fraud. 
Instead of bussing people in, it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles, he said. 
Would they charge each individual of voter fraud? Or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy, which they could prove? It‚Äôs one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars. If there‚Äôs a bus involved? That changes the dynamic. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the legality, because you can prove conspiracy if there‚Äôs a bus,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there are cars it‚Äôs much harder to prove ‚Ä¶ if there‚Äôs enough money you have people drive their POVs [personally owned vehicles] or you can have them drive rentals.‚Äù 
Foval says it‚Äôs easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret. ‚ÄúSo you use shells. Use shell companies.‚Äù 
Democrats are untouchable, he said. ‚ÄúThe question is, whether when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter? Because does it turn into an investigation or not? In this case, this state, the answer is no, because they don‚Äôt have any power to do anything.‚Äù 
Foval explained in the first video how pro-Clinton super PACs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the DNC, presumably a violation of federal law. 
‚ÄúI guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the super PACs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre consultants,‚Äù Foval says, ‚Äúso we‚Äôre not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts.‚Äù 
He adds: 
The thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual DNC and what we‚Äôre doing. There‚Äôs a double blind there. So they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it. 
The Clinton campaign ‚Äúis fully in it,‚Äù veteran left-wing strategist Robert Creamer confirms on hidden camera. ‚ÄúHillary knows through the chain of command what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù 
O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs group, Project Veritas Action Fund, filed a formal complaint against the Clinton campaign with the Federal Election Commission last week. 
The complaint states that Project Veritas: 
uncovered a criminal conspiracy where, in the words of Scott Foval, ‚ÄòThe way it works is: The [Hillary for America] campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays The Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes ‚Ä¶ on the ground.‚Äô This has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules. 
The complaint also accuses Priorities USA Action, Alliance for Retired Americans, Americans United for Change, and the Democratic National Committee of accepting ‚Äúprohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures‚Äù contrary to federal law and regulations. 
The first undercover video O‚ÄôKeefe released sent shock waves through the political community. 
In that video , released Oct. 17, we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at Republican candidate Trump‚Äôs campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by Clinton‚Äôs campaign. 
The idea was to foment violent at Trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the Left‚Äôs predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist. 
Such behavior constitutes terrorism, Austin Bay writes at the Observer : 
Creamer ran what amounts to a domestic U.S. political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the 2016 U.S. presidential election‚Äî‚Äúrigging the election,‚Äù to use the current term. [‚Ä¶] 
The election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery. That means physical fear‚Äîterror‚Äîis a core component of Americans United for Change‚Äôs crooked enterprise. Street thuggery is very low-level terrorism, but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise. Hardboy muscle, bottles and two by fours are street thuggery‚Äôs kinetics. Bottles and baseball bats are not Al Qaeda‚Äôs high explosives‚Äîbut they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties. People bleed. Street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent, criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse, the worse including lynchings and pogroms. If you don‚Äôt think street thuggery is terror then consider Kristalnacht. 
And O‚ÄôKeefe isn‚Äôt finished with the Hillary Clinton campaign yet.

October 27, 2016 Ann Coulter Every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. It doesn't help that white voters can't agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they'll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats -- the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. The people who will be worse off are everybody else -- the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. Look to Mexico for your future -- or any Third World country. Or to Univision's Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) Explaining Latino culture's acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that ""the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. ... Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.‚Äù One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an ""open mind"" about child rape because ""it's a cultural thing.‚Äù When it comes to multiculturalism, you can't say, We love the empanadas -- but we don't want 40-year-old men raping their nieces. This isn't an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures we're importing. As described in excruciating detail in Adios, America: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole , our media already have a totally ""open mind"" about incest and child rape -- and murder! -- when it's committed by immigrants. Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline: ""Illegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape,"" The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press went with the less catchy: ""Man guilty in case of human smuggling.‚Äù And where I would have used the headline, ""Illegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14-year-old Girl at Job Site,"" The Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, ""Columbus resident charged with molestation.‚Äù Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too -- provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. In 1989, Brooklyn judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from ""traditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood."" The female head of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. (Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing!) In 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. (That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants!) Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for ""Austin men."" Or ""Two.‚Äù Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack: -- ""Two held in attack on child"" -- Austin American-Statesman (Texas), July 19, 2013 -- ""Two Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack"" -- Daily Mail Online (UK), July 24, 2013 Needless to say, The New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal alien gang rape at all. By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape -- of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. The second case only was ""rape"" because of the girl's young age -- she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. The defendants were African-American. The victim was Mexican. That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made The New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. One suspect was African-American, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one? When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square (another one of Hillary's foreign policy successes!), journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. Conclusion: The real problem was the female reporters' American bosses and colleagues. (Definitely not Islam!) Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logan's rape: -- ""Why We Need Women in War Zones"" (""I would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. ... This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.‚Äù) -- ""Reporting While Female"" (""Women reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. ... In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment.‚Äù) Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans -- or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. (The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher.) Our country will be Zimbabwe, but -- if all goes according to the Democrats' plan -- they'll get to be Mugabe! That's Hillary's dream. If she wins, Joe Sobran's parody of the typical New York Times headline (about anything) will come true: ""Women and Minorities Hit Hardest.‚Äù";english;2016-10-27T09:20:33.390+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Our New Country: Women And Minorities Hit Hardest;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/long_border_fence-660x330.jpg?itok=dKdqn3eh;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Fatah has posted several children's drawings on Facebook. The drawings clearly show the success of PA and Fatah brainwashing children to believe that Israel only seeks to harm them, violence is good and that all of Israel really is ""Palestine."" Labeling the drawings ""innocent drawings"" that ""express the feelings of children of #Palestine,"" Fatah posted the drawing above showing Israel, as indicated by a Star of David, eating a Palestinian body wrapped in the Palestinian flag. Blood is seen coming from the body, and a glass of blood is next to the plate.Another drawing by a Palestinian child showed a crucified woman wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag, with her body in the shape of the PA map of ""Palestine"" that presents all of Israel as ""Palestine"" together with the PA areas. The crucifixion also repeats the analogy that Palestinians are Martyr victims like Jesus . Yet other drawings showed support for violence as legitimate means of Palestinian opposition to Israel. One child drew a Palestinian with a slingshot, another drew a hand with a rifle (see below). These drawings echo the PA and Fatah's encouragement of the use of violence against Israel and their glorification of terrorists as heroes. Palestinian Media Watch documented that summer camps organized by the PA Ministry of Education and the PLO educated children to see terrorist stabbers as role models . 
Other drawings repeated the world view that all of Israel is ""Palestine,"" showing the PA map of ""Palestine"" which completely erases the existence of Israel and its legitimacy (see below). This message is repeated endlessly by the PA and Fatah. Children are told that "" it will all return to us "" on kids' TV programs. The PA National Security Forces regularly post photos from all over Israel presenting the places as ""Palestine,"" and even crossword puzzles portray Israeli cities as ""occupied Palestine."" 
The PA's exploitation of Palestinian children's innocence is precisely what PMW has been highlighting and warning about for years. The PA and Fatah repeatedly demonize Israel as a monster whose only intention is to harm Palestinians. Israel is "" Satan with a tail "" on PA TV children's programs and "" Satan's project "" fighting ""Allah's project"" in sermons delivered by Mahmoud Abbas' advisor. Similarly, Palestinian terrorist murderers are being portrayed as innocent victims of alleged Israeli "" executions ."" A few of the drawings included doves, some calling for ""peace and freedom."" A major focus of Palestinian Authority policy today is to demand freedom for all imprisoned Palestinian terrorists including murderers. One drawing specifies ""Freedom for Ahmad Manasrah"" - a child terrorist who stabbed and critically wounded two Israelis, one of them a 13-year-old boy.";english;2016-10-27T09:20:33.446+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;PA Kids‚Äô Drawings: Israel Drinks Blood of Palestinians;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/il_eating_palestine.jpg?itok=apdhSHMR;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Under Iran‚Äôs Islamic laws, women are prohibited from performing basic day-to-day activities. I had firsthand experience of witnessing many of these strange and bizarre bans while living in Iran and other Muslim countries. Millions of women, including my relatives in Iran and Syria, continue to face these injustices. Some of the following rules, which are derived from Iran‚Äôs Islamic constitution and moral police codes, were recently reported on by Deutsche Welle Farsi . They exist in may other Islamic countries as well: 
1. Women are prohibited from taking selfies with soccer players. Specifically, Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúmoral committee‚Äù has banned women from taking selfies with famous soccer players. 
2. Iranian women are prohibited from riding bicycles. Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recently issued an Islamic fatwa regarding officially banning women from riding bicycles. He argued that ""riding bicycles often attracts the attention of men and exposes the society to corruption, and thus contravenes women's chastity, and it must be abandoned,‚Äù according to Iran‚Äôs state-run media. 
3. Coffee shops are prohibited from hiring women. According to Iran‚Äôs police, women are banned from working in any caf√©s. 
4. Iranian Muslim women cannot marry non-Muslim men. But Iranian Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women. 
5. It is forbidden for women to wear boots over their pants. (Why? I am not sure what is Iran‚Äôs Islamic logic behind this.) 
6. Women are not allowed to wear hats instead of veils to cover their hair. 
7. Women are not allowed to wear tight clothes that show their body curves. 
8. Women are prohibited from wearing tight clothes for swimming. 
9. Women are forbidden from changing their religion or criticizing Muhammad, Allah, the Supreme Leader and other Muslim leaders. 
10. Women are prohibited from entering sport stadiums and watching men‚Äôs sports. 
11. In Iran, buses and subways are divided in two sections. The larger front section is for men, the smaller back section is for women. Women are prohibited from entering the men's section even if there are no seats left in the back and there are plenty of empty seats in front of the bus. 
12. According to Iran‚Äôs moral police, women are banned from wearing leggings. 
13. Women are prohibited from showing strands of their hair on any side. Article 683 states: ‚ÄúThose women that appear in the streets and public places without the Islamic hijab, shall be sentenced from ten days to two months‚Äô imprisonment or fined from fifty thousand to five hundred thousand Rials.‚Äù 
14. Women are banned from going camping with men. 
15. Any kind of contraceptive surgery is not allowed for women. 
16. Women are banned from entering coffeehouses or smoking hookah. 
17. Women are not allowed to initiate divorce. Men have the right to do so. 
18. According to Iran‚Äôs family code, women cannot travel abroad except with the permission of their custodian or natural guardian (husband, father, etc.). They also cannot obtain a passport without the consent of their husbands. 
19. Women are banned from wearing clothes with writing on them. 
20. Women are banned from taking their hijab off in any sport event, including in the Olympics. 
21. Iranian women are prohibited from pursuing education in some academic fields. Iranian regime's oil minister argued that ‚Äúeducation of women in the field of operations such as drilling and processing and so on that require (physical) activities in operational areas and sites is useless and these are masculine (men‚Äôs) jobs.‚Äù 
22. Women are not allowed to work in any occupation if their husband disagrees with it. Article 1105 of the Civil Code states, ‚ÄúIn relations between husband and wife, the position of the head of the family exclusively belongs to the husband.‚Äù In addition, when it comes to employment laws, Article 1117 of the Civil Code indicates, ‚ÄúThe husband can prevent his wife from an occupation or technical profession which is incompatible with the family‚Äôs interests or the dignity of him or his wife.‚Äù 
23. Women are banned from receiving the same amount of inheritance as their male relatives. Even if a husband dies, the wife will receive only one-eighth of the inheritance if she has a child. 
24. Women are forbidden from having any physical contact with men, including shaking hands. 
25. Women are banned from becoming a Supreme Leader. 
26. Girls, as young as 9 years old, are not allowed to object to their parents decision to marry them off. 
27. Women are not allowed to object to their husband‚Äôs requests for sex. The law of Tamkin means women‚Äôs submission, obedience, full accessibility and unhampered sexual availability to her husband. Sexual availability is considered a woman‚Äôs duty and a man‚Äôs right. 
28. Women are not allowed to bring lawsuits if they are raped, unless they have four witnesses. 
29. Women are banned from socializing or dating men. 
30. Women are banned from attracting attention in public through ‚Äúflamboyant behavior‚Äù such as laughing loudly. 
31. Women are not allowed to show any part of their skin except the face. It is encouraged to cover the face as well. 
32. Women are not allowed to have any kind of alcoholic drinks. 
33. Women are not allowed to dance. 
34. Women are forbidden from being lesbian. Sex between two women is adultery and the punishments range from stoning to execution. 
35. Women are banned from listening to ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù music. 
36. Women are not allowed to have pets, such as a dog. 
37. Women are banned from adopting except if they have a husband and he agrees to do so. 
38. Women are prohibited from gambling in any kind of event. 
39. Women are banned from having sex or marrying a man up to five or six months after their divorce. 
40. Women are prohibited from having tattoos. 
41. Women are not allowed to have premarital relationships with men. 
42. In many of Iran‚Äôs provinces, women are banned from performing music on stage. 
43. Women are banned from being judges. 
44. Women are banned from striking their husband, but men are allowed to do so in some circumstances. 
45. Women are not allowed to show their jewelry in public. 
Some women continue to defy these rules, but many face severe punishment and discrimination for performing some of these normal day-to-day activities.

Call it the unintended revenge of Doug Band. 
Band used to be Bill's Huma, the guy that the big guy couldn't go to the bathroom without, let alone perform the simplest tasks. The Clinton Foundation was a Band project. The waters grew murkier, but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating Doug Band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called, running Bill Clinton Inc. 
And Band was also organizing personal income directly for Clinton. Under the heading, ‚ÄúFor-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e. Bill Clinton, Inc.),‚Äù Band wrote, ‚ÄúWe have dedicated our selves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities‚Äîincluding speeches, books, and advisory service engagements‚Ä¶ In support of the President‚Äôs for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family‚Äîfor personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities (e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than $50 million in for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the $66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements).‚Äù 
Band mentions four such ‚Äúarrangements‚Äù without naming them. Bill Clinton was paid nearly $18 million to be ‚Äúhonorary chancellor‚Äù of a for-profit college, Laureate International Universities, according to reports and the family‚Äôs tax returns. A Dubai-based firm, GEMS Education, paid Bill Clinton more than $560,000 in 2015, according to the tax returns. Band also lists a variety of speaking fees, previously disclosed by the Clintons, including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from UBS, Ericsson, BHP and Barclays. In 2011 alone, according to the Clinton‚Äôs tax returns, Bill Clinton earned $13,454,000 in speaking fees. 
Of course there was lots of ""synergy"" between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff, between Doug's Teneo interests and the entire Clintonworld octopus. 
""We have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities,"" Band wrote. He also said he had ""sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the foundation."" 
Band's memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneo's 20 clients at the time had given to the Clinton Foundation, how much they had paid Bill Clinton and, in some cases, how he or Kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments. 
Band wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation and $3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton. He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out $66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place. 
Band also described how Kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with UBS Global Wealth Management, introducing Bill Clinton to a top executive at a 2009 charity dinner. In the ensuing years, UBS upped its giving to the foundation, signed on as a Teneo client and agreed to pay Bill Clinton for speeches, Band wrote. 
Band was actually making the case that the entire network of the Clinton Foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the Clintons. Not to mention the interests of people around them. 
Banks and major corporations were doing business with Bill's toady, paying Bill money and donating to the Clinton Foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part, 
Band described in the memo how he combined his work for CGI and Teneo. He wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the 2011 CGI gathering to meet with Teneo clients. He also acknowledged giving free CGI memberships to ""target Teneo clients"" being cultivated as potential foundation donors. Memberships generally cost $20,000 a year. 
Teneo, meanwhile, named Bill Clinton its ""honorary chairman."" Clinton had been initially tapped for a three-year arrangement in which he would provide advice to Teneo ""regarding geopolitical, economic and social trends,"" according to a separate June 2011 memo that Band wrote to the State Department seeking ethics approval for the former president's employment. 
Bill Clinton was initially paid $2 million by Teneo, according to ""Man of the World,"" a book written with the former president's participation by author Joe Conason. 
And here's where it gets appropriately entertaining. 
But Band outlined that Kelly, his Teneo co-founder, had served simultaneously between 2009 and 2011 as an unpaid economic envoy to Northern Ireland appointed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included Coke, UBS and Dow. Band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with Kelly's State Department ethics agreement. 
Kelly's multiple roles came together during one State Department event in 2010, when then-Secretary Clinton recognized Dow, among other companies, for creating jobs in Northern Ireland and thanked Kelly for his work on the issue. 
Dow became one of Teneo's first major clients. According to Band's memo, Dow chief executive Andrew Liveris had been introduced to Bill Clinton over a round of golf with Kelly in August 2009. 
That's not consistent with mafia ethics agreements, but it's all good in Clintonworld.";english;2016-10-27T20:31:28.708+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Bill Clinton Inc: Billions for the Foundation, $116 Million for the Clintons;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/bill-clinton-finger_2.jpg?itok=2tQdtgdI;0;1;0;0;0;hate

The system is broken. It's deeply corrupted by insider politics . The situation at the center of power has reached the point of utter unaccountability. Insider politics function as a shadow government. That needs to change. Restoring America requires dismantling much of the Federal government not only for Constitutional reasons, but because it's a simple matter of saving the Republic. 
Hillary Clinton headlined a major fundraiser for a political action committee shortly before the group steered nearly $500,000 to the wife of the FBI official who oversaw the Clinton email investigation, DailyMail.com has learned. 
Clinton's ties to the Common Good VA - a Virginia state PAC run by Clinton's long-time friend and advisor Terry McAuliffe, its governor - came under scrutiny this week after the Wall Street Journal reported that the group donated heavily to the state senate campaign of Jill McCabe. 
Her husband Andrew McCabe led the FBI investigation into Clinton's emails. 
Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI, told the Wall Street Journal that he complied with federal ethics rules and was not promoted to lead the Clinton probe until months after his wife's unsuccessful state senate bid ended. 
Common Good VA was the largest single donor to Jill McCabe's campaign, election records show, giving her $467,000 between June and October of 2015. 
She was the third-largest recipient of money from the group, which can only contribute to Virginia state candidates. 
Her campaign also received an additional $207,788 from the Democratic Party of Virginia, a group over which McAuliffe exerts significant control. Combined, the money made up nearly one-third of her total funding. 
Now McCabe, a pediatrician, suddenly decided to run for public office. Unopposed. That was certainly nice of the Dems to not only put a first timer unopposed, but to throw piles and piles of cash at her. And some of that cash was coming from a key former Clinton Foundation man at the center of the latest Foundation scandal. 
Although Common Good VA is only allowed to fund state-level candidates, many of its largest donations came from outside of Virginia ‚Äì including $50,000 from Clinton Foundation official Doug Band in New York, $100,000 from Clinton loyalist Robert Johnson in Maryland, and $10,000 from Clinton mega-donor Stephen Cloobeck in Nevada. 
In the following months, Common Good VA received several major donations from other close Clinton associates, including $100,000 from Bill Clinton's business partner Ron Burkle in California and $50,000 from Ready for Hillary's finance committee member Leonard Lauder in New York. 
There are basic conflicts here. Someone this linked to the Clinton network should never have been investigating Hillary regardless of the dates and timing.

Tom Hayden, the Vietnam War protester and SDS founder, died this past weekend at age 76. 
Hayden‚Äôs journey was in many ways tragic. Born December 1939 in the Detroit suburbs, he was not, unlike many radical leaders, a red-diaper baby. His parents were Irish Catholics who named him after St. Thomas Aquinas and sent him to Catholic school. His father was a Marine who worked for Chrysler, and an abusive drunk. Hayden‚Äôs parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy, which affected him terribly. Hayden‚Äôs friend and ex-radical, David Horowitz, observed that Hayden harbored what Irving Howe once described as an ‚Äúobscure personal rage,‚Äù possibly from his estrangement from his father. ‚ÄúTom was indeed an angry man,‚Äù wrote Horowitz, ‚Äúwho seemed in perpetual search of enemies.‚Äù 
Hayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to America, and was the antithesis of anything that Thomas Aquinas would have ever imagined: SDS, Students for a Democratic Society. 
Hayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many Americans, the snarling activist who married ‚ÄúHanoi Jane‚Äù Fonda and literally wrote the script for SDS. Hayden wrote SDS‚Äôs manifesto, its founding Port Huron Statement, which Hayden‚Äôs cream-puff obituary in the Washington Post generously referred to as ‚Äúan expansive utopian manifesto that extolled ‚Äòparticipatory democracy‚Äô as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the Eisenhower decade.‚Äù 
Right. 
Hayden‚Äôs odd expressions of ‚Äúparticipatory democracy‚Äù included another writing he scribbled: an infamous June 4, 1968 letter wishing ‚ÄúGood fortune!‚Äù and ‚ÄúVictory!‚Äù to the North Vietnamese colonels who were killing American boys in Southeast Asia ‚Äî using the same kind of artillery that Hayden‚Äôs sweetheart Jane posed beside in her stint as a Viet Cong cover-girl. That was just one of countless disturbing actions by Tom Hayden at the time, all of which today‚Äôs leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and (of course) ‚Äúsocial justice.‚Äù 
But not etched in our memory was what might have been Tom Hayden‚Äôs swan song long after his and his wife‚Äôs cheerleading for the Viet Cong: namely, the document that he wrote for our President of Fundamental Transformation. Few know this, but Hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces, a group called Progressives for Obama. 
The group‚Äôs members came together in 2008, coalescing around the only Democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was far-left enough for them to support. They constituted a Who‚Äôs Who of the ‚Äô60s SDS crowd. Among the nearly 100 formal ‚Äúsigners‚Äù to Progressives for Obama were Mark Rudd, Carl Davidson, Jane Fonda, Thorne Dreyer, Daniel Ellsberg, Richard Flacks, John McAuliff, Jay Schaffner, and more. Columbia University was naturally well-represented, if not through the likes of Rudd, who shut down the campus in 1968, then through current faculty such as Todd Gitlin, a former SDS president who today is professor of journalism, sociology, and chair of Columbia‚Äôs doctoral program in communications. 
Whereas the likes of Obama friends Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in 2008 by conservatives like Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, Progressives for Obama flew under the radar, largely unnoticed even by the right. 
Appropriately, spearheading Progressives for Obama was the man who had spearheaded SDS. Tom Hayden was one of the four ‚Äúinitiators‚Äù of Progressives for Obama, along with Barbara Ehrenreich, Bill Fletcher, Jr., and Danny Glover. 
It is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of Progressives for Obama resembled the roster of SDS-ers called to testify before Congress in December 1969 for their subversive activities. Aside from the likes of Hayden, Rudd, and Davidson, other SDS-ers among Progressives for Obama were Bob Pardun, who was SDS education secretary from 1966-67, and Paul Buhle, a professor who has recently sought to revive SDS. 
Among these names from the insane ‚Äô60s, all were fired up in 2008 over the unique opportunity that a fellow far-left radical, one Barack Obama, offered. They saw Obama as a golden chance, a once-in-a-lifetime moment, and they got it on November 4, 2008. Obama won the day, and they at last won the day, too. 
And therein, among the Progressives for Obama, the testimony of leader Tom Hayden was especially revealing. 
Understand that after his early life establishing SDS, meeting with and expressing ‚ÄúGood fortune!‚Äù and ‚ÄúVictory!‚Äù to the Viet Cong, and vigorously protesting the American system, Hayden went into politics, professional activism, and education. Like his erstwhile SDS brethren, Hayden grasped the power of higher education (which they have pervaded), and served as a professor at Pitzer College and also at Obama‚Äôs alma mater, Occidental College. 
Like Mark Rudd, like Bill Ayers, like Bernardine Dohrn (all of them now in higher education), Hayden had come to view a quick ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù of the system as too daunting, if not impossible. He had become much more patient, instead advocating a ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù evolution of slower, measured change . By 2008, he was seeking to advance the ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù cause within the established, mainstream Democratic Party. 
Of course, Hayden once helped blow up the Democratic Party‚Äôs national convention in 1968. No matter: the party of 2008 was different and warmly accepted him. 
Hayden was ecstatic over Barack Obama‚Äôs presidential campaign. He jumped in with both feet, looking to assist wherever he could, with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining America in Vietnam. Not one to tinker around, Hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement, as he had done for SDS ‚Äî once again there at the creation. The man who drafted SDS‚Äôs pivotal Port Huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for Progressives for Obama. 
During the 2008 campaign, a touched Hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of Obama. In one article, titled, ‚ÄúObama and the Open and Unexpected Future,‚Äù written for CommonDreams.org, self-described as a website for ‚ÄúBreaking News & Views for the Progressive Community,‚Äù Hayden mused: 
I didn‚Äôt see him coming. When I read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president, I was at least sentient enough to be interested. When I read Dreams of My Father [sic], I was taken aback by its depth. This young man apparently gave his first public speech, against South African apartheid, at an Occidental College rally organized by Students for Economic Democracy, the student branch of the Campaign for Economic Democracy which I chaired in 1979-82. The buds of curiosity quickened. 
Hayden saw in Obama a long-awaited vehicle for ‚Äúeconomic democracy,‚Äù an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth ‚Äî ‚Äúeconomic justice,‚Äù or ‚Äúredistributive change,‚Äù as Obama himself had once put it. Hayden wished that, ‚ÄúWin or lose, the Obama movement will shape progressive politics‚Ä¶ for a generation to come.‚Äù He also hoped that that progressive movement likewise ‚Äúmight transform‚Äù Obama as well. Both could reinforce and shape one another. 
Hayden wrote that in June 2008. When Obama was elected later the following November, Hayden was beside himself with joy, surely shocked that the American electorate had finally voted for a president that Tom Hayden saw as his kind of president. Once upon a time, traditional Democrats like Hayden‚Äôs parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what Tom and his pals did to their party‚Äôs convention in Chicago in 1968, at what they did during the Days of Rage the next year, at what they did at Columbia during the student strike, and on and on. But now, by 2008, the Democratic Party was theirs. It belonged to the ‚Äô60s kiddies. 
The former SDS founder became particularly vocal in his praise for Obama once the election was over. During the election, the goal was to organize, raise money, but not speak too loudly, out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional Democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills, who joined unions, who ‚Äúclinged‚Äù to their God and guns, who prayed rosaries and filled churches, who were pro-life and anti-gay marriage. With the presidency now secured, Hayden could open up. Joined by his former comrades at the take-no-prisoners website of Progressives for Obama, he began regularly sounding off against Obama‚Äôs critics ‚Äî those opposing ‚Äúsingle payer‚Äù or the ‚Äúpublic option‚Äù in ‚Äúhealthcare reform,‚Äù or government ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù of General Motors ‚Äî with the subtlety of a howitzer. 
With the presidency won, Hayden and his allies were free to express themselves, to demonize health-insurance companies, the financial-services industry, AIG, the Big Three automakers, or whatever other capitalist ‚Äúreptile‚Äù (Lenin‚Äôs phrase) stood in the way of President Obama‚Äôs desire for ‚Äúreform‚Äù and mandate for ‚Äúchange.‚Äù 
In the two-term presidency of fundamental transformation under Obama, Hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams. 
By this election cycle, in 2016, Tom Hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the Democratic Party. 
Alas, it was fitting that Tom Hayden became seriously ill (his final stand) during a turn for the worse at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this past summer, where he was striving to ensure that the Democratic Party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via SDS and the Weather Underground. That path, in the hands of Hillary Clinton, is assured. 
Today, at long last, for Tom Hayden and friends, the new Democratic Party and the new America is theirs. He can rest in peace, assured that his mission is finally being accomplished.";english;2016-10-27T21:09:41.139+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Tom Hayden: From SDS and Viet Cong to Progressives for Obama;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sd_5.jpg?itok=lIQxOjuL;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Obama's abstention from a UN vote against the US is a new low for the most anti-American administration in American history. Under Obama, our foreign policy has been reoriented toward damaging our own interests as much as possible. But actively opposing US policy at the UN is a new low. 
The resolution A/RES/71/5 is on the ""Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba"". 
It was introduced at the request of Cuba back in '91 with a memorandum that accused America of ""pursuing an aggressive policy against Cuba with the declared aim of imposing on it the political, social and economic order which the united States authorities consider most fitting. This policy has included direct military intervention, the threat of nuclear annihilation, the instigation and carrying out of countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders."" 
As Obama's creepy toady Ben Rhodes tweeted, ""No reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose."" 
Except the failed policy is that of the United States. By ""we"", Rhodes means that Obama and the left aren't going to defend the United States in international forums when they disagree with the US. 
All this is yet another reminder that the people running the country are not of the country. They're a hostile foreign ideology that sees itself as separate from the United States and does not believe it has any responsibilities toward the United States. 
At the UN, Samantha Power took the anti-American positions to applause from a UN united with Obama against America. 
""For more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain. [Applause.] Thank you. ""

But...but... I thought we were trying to help people. 
ObamaCare visionary Jonathan ""Stupidity of the American Voter"" Gruber is back. When last we heard from the man with the same name as the Die Hard villain, he was being ushered off the scene after explaining how stupid everyone was . 
An architect of the federal healthcare law said last year that a ""lack of transparency"" and the ""stupidity of the American voter"" helped Congress approve ObamaCare. In a clip unearthed Sunday, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Jonathan Gruber appears on a panel and discusses how the reform earned enough votes to pass. 
He suggested that many lawmakers and voters didn't know what was in the law or how its financing worked, and that this helped it win approval. ""Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,‚Äù Gruber said. ""And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass."" Gruber made the comment while discussing how the law was ""written in a tortured way"" to avoid a bad score from the Congressional Budget Office. He suggested that voters would have rejected ObamaCare if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes, either by budget analysts or the public. ""If CBO scored the [individual] mandate as taxes, the bill dies,"" Gruber said. 
Now the Gruber is back... and ready to explain why the only problem with ObamaCare is the lack of severe beatings . 
‚ÄúThere is no sense in which‚Äù the law ‚Äúhas to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty. We have individuals who are essentially free-riding on the system, they‚Äôre essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance. The whole idea of this plan, which was pioneered in Massachusetts, was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate. The penalty right now is probably too low, and that‚Äôs something I think ideally we would fix.‚Äù 
Ideally we would penalize Gruber and everyone involved in inflicting this monstrosity on the public. But predictably Gruber's proposal is to offer up more beatings until morale improves.

October 28, 2016 Richard Baehr 
Below is Richard Baehr's review of David Horowitz's new book, The Left in Power: Clinton to Obama (reprinted from American Thinker with permission). The book is volume 7 of The Black Book of the American Left , a multi-volume collection of David Horowitz's conservative writings that will, when completed, be the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to define the Left and its agenda. (Order HERE .) We encourage our readers to visit BlackBookOfTheAmericanLeft.com which features Horowitz‚Äôs introductions to Volumes 1-7 of this 9-volume series, along with their tables of contents, reviews and interviews with the author. 
Every year, there is some report of the blissful ignorance of American history demonstrated by the supposedly best and brightest at elite American universities. Suffice it to say the collected writings of David Horowitz on the American Left, which constitute part of a solid foundation for understanding the last half century of American politics, are nowhere to be found on any college or high school reading list. 
Horowitz‚Äôs latest book, The Left in Power: Clinton to Obama , is the seventh volume in his nine-volume collection, The Black Book of the American Left . This new volume provides a collection of his writings over the last quarter century, focusing primarily on the Left‚Äôs control in our government and culture. As Horowitz reveals, even during the Bush years, conservatives were on the defense and leftists controlled the narrative as they attempted to destroy Bush and his chances for re-election in 2004. Their primary mode of attack was to undermine America‚Äôs efforts in Iraq almost from the start of the conflict, when just months earlier a majority of Senate Democrats and near half of House Democrats had supported the President. The Left then destroyed Bush‚Äôs second term with bogus charges of racist neglect in the handling of Hurricane Katrina. There was plenty of incompetence in the response to Katrina, but local and state officials ‚Äî all Democrats, of course, and many of them African American ‚Äî were the principal operators on the ground during the crisis. 
The immediate abandonment of support for the Iraq war effort was a signal event in American history, sending a message that a large part of the Democratic Party was not remotely concerned about the morale of our men and women fighting overseas. The weak effort by some Democrats to hold onto an ounce of patriotic resolve -- ‚Äúend the war, support the troops‚Äù -- was designed more for campaign speeches than any meaningful attempt to convey national unity for the effort underway by our armed forces. So too, the obsession with Abu Ghraib gave the lie to the Democrats‚Äô ‚Äúsupport our troops‚Äù message, as a broad brush was used to paint the incident as somehow what you would expect from our military on a routine basis. 
Horowitz outlines this narrative, faulting the Bush administration for failing to fight harder to present its story of why we went into Iraq and the risks if we had done nothing. Regrettably, the Bush administration never had a chance to get a better defense of the Iraq war out to the media. Most in the media considered the Bush administration illegitimate due to its narrow victory in the 2000 presidential contest, a lie to be sure . Unfortunately, it is almost certainly true that the media today are far more in the bag for the left than ten or twenty years ago and work harder at pushing the left‚Äôs agenda. The soft liberalism of Walter Cronkite has been replaced by cable and national network anchors who routinely bury stories embarrassing to their side and focus on those that can do damage to the other side. During the current Presidential election cycle, we have seen the most prestigious media organs explain why it is necessary and appropriate for them to be biased this year. It is a special time, they argue, because Trump is, in their view, a unique threat to the Republic. 
On the other hand, the media have been loath to consider the damage to the country caused by Barack Obama -- the loss of respect abroad for America‚Äôs will to fight, the degradation of our military readiness, the fraying of ties with allies, and the near obsessive outreach to America‚Äôs enemies that led to agreements such as the nuclear deal with Iran, best described as an abject surrender of American interests that will lead to the funding of fanatical nuclear regime. About 85% of those supposedly sensible pro-Israel Democrats walked the plank behind their great leader on that deal, with no visible regrets to date. There was simply too much political risk to oppose the first black president of their party. The media were happy to parrot the administration‚Äôs talking points for the nuclear deal, something the manipulators crowed over at the White House. 
At least in the propaganda use of Abu Ghraib, the Left was honest in revealing what it thinks about the military. As Horowitz outlines in article after article, the Left is fighting a war that most Americans do not see, disguising its intentions through its aggressive, unceasing promotion of ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù policies ‚Äúto make America a better place.‚Äù This commitment to deception emerges, Horowitz reveals, from the allegiance to the ideology of Saul Alinsky‚Äôs ‚ÄúRules for Radicals,‚Äù a formative doctrine for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The progressive goal is to achieve a new society that has never been seen before in this country, though it has been promised and has catastrophically failed in many places around the globe. In America, the Left is not only unconcerned with selling their program to the public, but also, Horowitz argues, it is fearful of the result of voters knowing what it is pursuing. One prime example was the admission of MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber that health care law would never have made it through Congress if it had been presented honestly. 
The Left is also busy at work making it easier for itself to win politically. Horowitz provides chapter and verse on the Left‚Äôs efforts to rapidly change the composition of the voting pool -- motor voter registration with no birth certificate required, fighting every effort to combat voter fraud with charges of racism and ‚Äúturning the clock back,‚Äù even when states were willing to pay for potential voters obtaining the needed documents to register, support for open borders, expansion of legal immigration, and amnesty and citizenship (and voting rights) for more than ten million already in the country illegally. Here the Left‚Äôs mentor and financier is George Soros and his buddies, who have funded dozens of organizations which fight on multiple fronts every day to advance the left politically. And Horowitz has done a great public service by his Discover the Network listing of the people responsible for America‚Äôs steady drift to the radical Left. 
The Left uses the racism charge in many of the confrontations it creates. Of course, the problems of America‚Äôs inner cities, all under complete control of one political party for half a century, have never been of even near equal interest to the Democrats as their ability to continue to win enormous majorities among inner city voters, particularly African Americans. The Left has fully endorsed the teacher unions‚Äô opposition to charter schools, and voucher programs, though both are popular with minority group parents and children. The two major teachers unions are simply too powerful a support group for the Democratic Party (campaign cash, votes, and volunteers) for the Left to support policies that might lead to a better future for kids as opposed to continued growth in expenditures for the teachers unions and their workforce. 
In the last two years, the Soros-funded Black Lives Matter movement has created a near national hysteria over the alleged systematic effort by police to kill unarmed black men. Between two and three dozen unarmed blacks are killed by cops each year, many of them in situations where the ‚Äùvictims‚Äù were almost certainly responsible for what happened to them -- Michael Brown in Ferguson is a prime example. One wonders where the news media are to report on the police shooting of unarmed whites, which greatly outnumber those of unarmed blacks. Perhaps because there are no riots, or looting, these incidents have no cachet. More likely, they do not fit the systemic racism charge now routinely thrown around by everyone from the current President to Hillary Clinton. 
In Chicago in 9 months this year, over 400 blacks, mostly men, have been shot and killed, almost exclusively by other black men. By year end, over 4,000 Chicagoans will have been shot. One might think this was a bigger story of urban calamity and civil society breakdown than a shooting in Charlotte. Chicago‚Äôs mayor says that police ‚Äúhave gone fetal,‚Äù avoiding making stops in crime ridden neighborhoods, with the ACLU looking over their shoulder demanding a report for every stop, and activists in the neighborhoods treating the police with scorn and abuse, following a bad police shooting captured on video and kept hidden from the public by Chicago‚Äôs mayor to protect his re-election bid. Rahm Emanuel must also have read Alinsky, for he knows whose hide to protect first and foremost. The victims of the police pullback in Chicago, Baltimore, St, Louis and other cities, called ‚Äúthe Ferguson effect,‚Äù are many more dead black men, killed in crime waves that are reminiscent of the 1990s. Even the FBI Director admits the Ferguson Effect is real, when not covering for Hillary Clinton. 
Horowitz‚Äô latest book is full of insights and straight talk on the goals and the mission of the Left, and how it has advanced its cause this last quarter century. He provides the kind of arguments that keep his books from getting reviewed by the New York Times. And there is always a horrible slur available from the Left to describe a viewpoint that counters one of its missions. The Left chooses to ignore the argument and uses character assassination for the people making it. It argues that these are people (Horowitz included) unworthy of serious consideration, or respect. 
Silencing the critic or the dissident or limiting his visibility has been a long time weapon of the Left. So far, Horowitz keeps writing, and America is free enough that the Left, though it clearly wants to, cannot ban his books. George Soros and his family have another $20 billion to spend on changing America. The Alinsky acolytes have their mission laid out to make use of the funds and create an America where the smart bureaucrats can organize society and distribute its wealth, so results are all equal. And we can all sing along with the Pete Seeger songs as we turn away from any role overseas (where of course we have primarily been an agent of evil) and disinvest in defense every year. 
Let‚Äôs hope that some of America‚Äôs young will read Horowitz‚Äô books,and learn what their professors and teachers won‚Äôt teach them.";english;2016-10-28T07:54:59.211+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;The Left in Power: Clinton to Obama;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/bc.jpg?itok=4S4NGvbL;0;1;0;0;0;hate

The Obama administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical left-wing activist groups that work to elect Democrats, according to an eye-opening new study from a nonpartisan research institute. 
During Eric Holder‚Äôs term as attorney general from February 2009 through April 2015, a little under $37.3 billion was paid by U.S. banks under the threat of federal lawsuits. All but $720 million of that sum came from three big settlements: Bank of America, Citigroup, and JP Morgan Chase. 
Many of the cases rest on bogus ‚Äúdisparate impact theory‚Äù which left-wing government lawyers use to make sure that ‚Äúbanks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income areas, regardless of the reasons for the disparity.‚Äù 
Instead of being used to help the supposed victims of these banks, the money flows to leftist allies of President Obama. 
Adding insult to injury, the process by which the money snakes its way to left-wing organizations is both corrupt and unconstitutional, according to the report from the Government Accountability Institute that is called ‚ÄúFollow the Money: How the Department of Justice Funds Progressive Activists.‚Äù (Bestselling Clinton Cash author and anti-corruption crusader Peter Schweizer is GAI‚Äôs president. The full 115-page report is available in PDF form here .) 
The report states: 
The [Department of Justice] has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to third-party organizations outside of the appropriations process‚Äîan unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for Congressional authority. 
It adds, ‚Äú[t]hese funds directed by the DOJ effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by Congress.‚Äù 
Much of the cash moves through NeighborWorks. The nonprofit gave more than $53 million to the rabble-rousing group Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America (NACA) whose leader, Bruce Marks, calls himself a ‚Äúbank terrorist.‚Äù It also gave over $4 million to Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE), ‚Äúan organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal North Korean sympathizer.‚Äù 
The ill-gotten funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to left-wing groups such as National Council of La Raza, NHS of Chicago, National Urban League, and Operation HOPE. 
Many of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect Democrats. 
Catalist, a George Soros-funded for-profit data analytics company specializing in left-progressive causes, along with a group called Nonprofit VOTE ‚Äúmobilize these federally funded nonprofits ‚Ä¶ to get the vote out for those who ‚Äòtend to be reliably progressive,‚Äô‚Äù the report states. 
Catalist was founded by former Bill Clinton aide Harold Ickes in 2006 following Democrats‚Äô electoral wipeout in 2004. Left-wing activists believed Republicans owed George W. Bush‚Äôs re-election victory to heavy spending on voter contact technology, including databases. 
According to a Capital Research Center report : 
Catalist boasts it was vital to President Obama‚Äôs 2008 victory. By its own admission, ‚Äúover 90 organizations, campaigns and committees‚Äù used the company‚Äôs services. ‚ÄúBased on data that was loaded into the Catalist databases and then standardized,‚Äù a Catalist analysis of the 2008 cycle says, ‚Äúprogressive organizations, the Obama campaign, and federal party committees attempted to contact more than 106 million people. This means that the progressive community attempted to contact over 46% of the U.S. adult population. Contacts were delivered in-person, over the phone, by mail and over the internet.‚Äù 
Of course, leeching off others is generally how the activist Left funds itself. Apart from oceans of cash supplied by left-wing fat-cat mega-donors like George Soros and Michael Bloomberg and a galaxy of radical foundations, the Left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the federal, state, and local levels. 
The report states the evidence shows the Left is using the Department of Justice and ‚Äúthe power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist.‚Äù 
In other words, the Left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of America. There is no level so-called playing field in American electoral politics. In a sense the system is rigged. There is the parasitic Left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else. 
Conservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail. For a half century, the Left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance radical, subversive causes in the United States. 
Changes in federal social policy in the mid-1960s helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist astro-turfing. Under the profoundly antisocial War on Poverty, the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since 1965 to liberal and radical so-called community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo. One could say America declared war on itself and conscripted Saul Alinsky-inspired pressure groups to do the fighting. In recent decades those on the Left ‚Äì including groups like ACORN and money-grubbing con artists like Jesse Jackson Sr. ‚Äì have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests. 
Conservative groups receive no such largesse from Uncle Sam (and in fairness, many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered it). 
This sue-and-settle corruption will undoubtedly continue if Hillary Clinton becomes president. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez , no stranger to the shakedown business himself, is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new Clinton administration. Perez, who previously ran the DoJ's Civil Rights Division, is also a past president of Casa de Maryland, a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by George Soros and the late Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. 
The money-raising scam described in the GAI report isn‚Äôt the only way left-wing groups fill up their bank accounts. 
Activist groups were encouraged to agitate by the Carter-era Community Reinvestment Act, which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket. Banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like ACORN had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in so-called underserved communities. Banks that paid enough -- whatever that means -- got left alone, but banks that didn't, got their legs broken. 
Few serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of 2008 were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination. 
Leftists played both sides. They called banks racist and demanded more subprime lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers. It was (and is) pure gangsterism. Through the magic of dysphemism, the once sought after subprime lending was transformed into ""predatory lending."" 
The shaking down of lenders intensified when then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin presided over the Clinton administration's effort to put the CRA on steroids. Banks began to make risky subprime loans and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac aggregated them for sale in the secondary market as mortgage-backed securities. These practices made it easier for banks to give in to the demands of ACORN and other groups to originate more and more doomed mortgages because they knew they could offload their high-risk debt on quasi-governmental suckers Fannie and Freddie, which were under intense political pressure to service the subprime market. 
President Clinton ‚Äúturned the Community Reinvestment Act, a once-obscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law, into one of the most powerful mandates shaping American cities‚Äîand as Senate Banking Committee chairman Phil Gramm memorably put it, a vast extortion scheme against the nation‚Äôs banks,‚Äù Howard Husock of the Manhattan Institute wrote in City Journal . 
When Husock wrote in 2000, U.S. banks had ‚Äúcommitted nearly $1 trillion for inner-city and low-income mortgages and real estate development projects, most of it funneled through a nationwide network of left-wing community groups, intent, in some cases, on teaching their low-income clients that the financial system is their enemy and, implicitly, that government, rather than their own striving, is the key to their well-being.‚Äù 
Enterprising left-wing levelers never tire of dreaming up these redistribution schemes.

Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. 
Before long the same administration that declared the fighting in Iraq over several times will claim victory over ISIS. The timetable for its push against the Islamic State appears to have less do with the victimized Christians and Yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of Syrian Muslims than with the Clinton presidential campaign. Like Obama‚Äôs declarations that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were over, the announcement that ISIS has been defeated will be premature. 
It is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of Islamic terrorism. 
Long before its current string of defeats, ISIS had begun evolving into another Al Qaeda; a multinational alliance of Jihadists scattered around the world. Bombing Mosul isn‚Äôt hard, but try bombing Marseille, Brussels or London. There is no doubt that the ability of ISIS to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from New York to Miami to Nice to Munich. But it would be dangerous to assume that losing Iraq and Syria will stop ISIS. 
ISIS doesn‚Äôt matter. The idea of ISIS does. And the idea of ISIS is Islamic supremacism. 
The organization we think of ISIS has transformed and rebranded countless times. Even now our leaders vacillate between calling it ISIS, ISIL or, more childishly, Daesh, while it dubs itself the Islamic State. We have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade. It would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities. 
The bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization. We are fighting an idea. That is not to contend, as Obama does, that we can debate it to death. It is not the sort of idea that argues with words, but with bullets, bombs and swords. But neither does it just go away if you seize a city. 
Al Qaeda in Iraq not only survived the death of Zarqawi, but it became even more dangerous under Baghdadi. It would be risky to assume that ISIS will die with him. Instead it may very well grow into a new phase of Al Qaeda, one that ties together some of the world‚Äôs deadliest Islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from Al Qaeda‚Äôs leadership fatigue. 
The rise of Islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them. If ISIS does recede into a localized oblivion, reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in Baghdad, then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place. Each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate. 
To break the cycle, we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of Islamic terrorism. 
ISIS is not un-Islamic. It is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly Islamic in that, unlike its predecessors in the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda, it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities. Its goals are the same as those of every Islamic political organization, including those dubbed moderate. It seeks to restore and enforce an Islamic system in every part of the Muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the non-Muslim world. If this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists, then it could be bombed to pieces in some Syrian or Iraqi backwater. 
But it‚Äôs the driving force of Islam. That‚Äôs why it won‚Äôt go away. No amount of appeasement will banish it. 
Taking in more Muslim settlers, pressuring Israel and letting the Muslim Brotherhood colonize our foreign policy won‚Äôt do it. We‚Äôve tried it and it actually makes Islamic terrorism much worse. 
When the announcement is made, the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated ISIS by mobilizing a Muslim coalition. But it wasn‚Äôt Obama who mobilized a Muslim coalition. The coalition, such as it was, mobilized them. Obama provided useful support to Islamic state sponsors of terror, such as Iran and Turkey, assorted Islamic Jihadists on the ground, some blatantly associated with Sunni and Shiite terror groups in their internal Jihadist conflict with ISIS over who will fight us. 
The ‚Äúallies‚Äù we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow. 
And that is why claiming credit for beating ISIS accomplishes nothing. ISIS is an expression of an Islamic impulse encoded in the Koran. Islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse. ISIS was nastier and uglier than most of the Islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this. Though even it found its Boko Haram affiliate in Nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach. 
If ISIS vanishes from the world stage, Islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss. Or so the thinking goes. The Islamic State was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash Islamic terror. It was hard to ignore. But a scattering of Islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public. 
History suggests that‚Äôs wishful thinking. 
Islamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding. Growing Muslim populations, both at home and in Muslim settlements in the West, and the increase in travel and communications, the infrastructure of globalism, spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world. Wealthy and unstable Muslim countries, rich in oil but poor in power, finance its spread through mosques and guns. 
These are the ingredients that give us ISIS or any other combination or letters that stands for Islamic terror. To do anything meaningful about it, we would have to reverse the decline of the West. 
Islam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline. Civilizational decline is why it is rising once again. An obscure local terror group eventually turned into ISIS by filling a power vacuum. Even as Obama performs another touchdown dance, some other group will be making that same journey. Its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own. 
Until we come to terms with this civilizational struggle, we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy. We are not fighting an acronym, whether it‚Äôs ISIS or ISIL; we are fighting an Islamic State. 
This is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the West or to Islam.";english;2016-10-28T07:54:59.950+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;What Will Replace ISIS?;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/ds_2.jpg?itok=eeogWH7x;0;1;0;0;0;hate

The objective of this libelous new report from the hard-Left money-making and incitement machine the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is made plain within it: ‚ÄúBefore you book a spokesperson from an anti-Muslim extremist group or quote them in a story, research their background ‚Äî detailed in this in-depth guide to 15 of the most visible anti-Muslim activists‚Äî and consider the consequences of giving them a platform.‚Äù 
They wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat, blaming us for a supposed rise in ‚ÄúIslamophobia.‚Äù If they really want to stamp out suspicion of Islam, of course, they will move against not us, but the likes of Omar Mateen, Syed Rizwan Farook, Tashfeen Malik, Nidal Malik Hasan, Mohammed Abdulazeez, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the myriad other Muslims who commit violence in the name of Islam and justify it by reference to Islamic teachings. 
The SPLC doesn‚Äôt do that because its objective is not really to stop ‚ÄúIslamophobia‚Äù at all, but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of ‚ÄúIslamophobes,‚Äù who can only be stopped if you write a check to the SPLC. That‚Äôs what this is really all about. 
In constructing this illusory edifice, the SPLC labels me and fourteen others ‚Äúanti-Muslim extremists.‚Äù We are, of course, no more ‚Äúanti-Muslim‚Äù than foes of the Nazis were anti-German, but note the word ‚Äúextremists.‚Äù That‚Äôs the mainstream media and Obama administration‚Äôs term of choice for jihad terrorists. In what way are we ‚Äúextremists‚Äù? Has anyone on the SPLC‚Äôs hit list (and given the SPLC‚Äôs track record of inciting violence against its targets, that is exactly what it is) ever blown anything or anyone up? Beheaded anyone? Boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people? No, all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and Sharia oppression. The SPLC is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin, the non-Muslim bin Ladens and Awlakis. Until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so, however, the SPLC‚Äôs libel is only that: a libel. 
It‚Äôs also passingly ironic that the SPLC list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company, as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as ‚ÄúIslamophobes.‚Äù But their temporizing and pandering didn‚Äôt work: they ended up on the Index of Prohibited Thinkers anyway, as will, ultimately, anyone who dares to note that Islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings. 
The ‚Äúreport‚Äù as a whole stands as an example of the Left‚Äôs strange tendency to present true statements as if they were self-evidently false, without bothering to explain why. Apparently the SPLC knows its supporters and is aware that it doesn‚Äôt need to bother with troublesome things like, you know, facts. 
The SPLC‚Äôs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as self-evidently false. For example, it says that Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch ‚Äúaccuses immigrant-run stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps.‚Äù This is a case that Corcoran makes with evidence ‚Äì evidence that the SPLC doesn‚Äôt bother to try disproving. It says that Steven Emerson of the Investigative Project on Terrorism ‚Äúhas claimed that the Obama administration ‚Äòextensively collaborates‚Äô with the Muslim Brotherhood.‚Äù That he actually has done so doesn‚Äôt seem to bother them. As Andrew C. McCarthy has noted , ‚ÄúBarack Obama has spent his presidency cultivating Islamists, particularly from the international Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates in the United States.‚Äù The SPLC also hits Emerison for having ‚Äúasserted that Europe is riddled with ‚Äòno-go zones.‚Äô‚Äù Regarding ‚Äúno-go zones,‚Äù here are some news articles from just the past few weeks: 
Germany: Police ‚Äúsick‚Äù of citizens‚Äô no-go zone fears 
The SPLC excoriates Brigitte Gabriel of ACT for America for saying that any ‚Äúpracticing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah ‚Ä¶ who goes to mosque and prays every Friday, who prays five times a day ‚Äî this practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen of the United States.‚Äù Yet it says nothing, of course, about the many teachings of the Qur‚Äôan that contradict American Constitutional principles: the denial of the freedom of speech, the death penalty for apostasy, the devaluation of women, and more. How to reconcile these teachings with U.S. citizenship, the SPLC did not bother to explain. 
The SPLC quotes David Horowitz saying: ‚ÄúThere are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists ‚Äî and that includes people in the Democratic Party, even those who are anti-terrorist.‚Äù Here again, no refutation is offered ‚Äì yet the Left‚Äôs dalliance with Palestinian jihad groups and overall anti-Americanism make it impossible to dismiss Horowitz‚Äôs assertion. 
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, we‚Äôre told, ‚Äúis gripped by paranoid fantasies about Muslims destroying the West from within.‚Äù The SPLC doesn‚Äôt bother to mention the Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America , the captured Muslim Brotherhood internal document that explained that Brotherhood members ‚Äúmust understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‚Äòsabotaging‚Äô its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God‚Äôs religion is made victorious over all other religions.‚Äù 
In attacking Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, the SPLC descended to outright fabrications. Notes Geller : ‚ÄúTheir claim that I insist that Obama is the ‚Äòlove child‚Äô of Malcolm X is patently untrue. The SPLC also states that I ‚Äòhave spoken to a neo-fascist group in Germany,‚Äô when in fact I have never even been to Germany.‚Äù It characterizes former FBI agent John Guandolo‚Äôs claim that CIA director John Brennan was a convert to Islam as an ‚Äúoutlandish accusation,‚Äù when in fact ‚Äúa U.S. asset assigned overseas with Brennan in Saudi Arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that Brennan was indeed the target of a Saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion. Brennan has also stated publicly that he visited Mecca, which is impossible for a non-Muslim to do unless he is a special guest of the Saudi King.‚Äù 
Even more strangely, the SPLC targets Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman who grew up as a Muslim in Somalia, suffered genital mutilated at the hands of Muslims, is under death threats from Muslims, and lives in exile from her homeland because of Muslims. Instead of trying to discredit her, the SPLC should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against Sharia oppression. But the SPLC has other priorities. 
Of me, the SPLC concedes that I am a ‚Äúreal intellectual‚Äù but complains that I am ‚Äúentirely self-taught in the study of Islam.‚Äù An odd objection. One cannot be both ‚Äúself-taught‚Äù and a ‚Äúreal intellectual‚Äù? In any case, it‚Äôs false: I am indeed mostly self-taught in the study of Islam, and make no secret of or apologies for it; every day‚Äôs headlines proves me correct. Nonetheless, the fact is that I did first read the Qur‚Äôan and began studying Islam in earnest while at the University of North Carolina. My claims, says the SPLC, are ‚Äúprovably false,‚Äù but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true, without any attempt to refute them. 
It even says that I have ‚Äúreferred to Barack Obama as ‚Äòthe first Muslim president.‚Äô‚Äù This one epitomizes the dishonesty of the SPLC. The quote comes from an article I wrote in 2007 discussing how Obama was not a Muslim, stating that his obvious affinity for Islam and the Muslim world could make him into ‚Äúour first Muslim president‚Äù the way Bill Clinton was called ‚Äúour first black president.‚Äù After eight years of Obama, I‚Äôd say I was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion. 
The SPLC, finally, hits me for having ‚Äúeven suggested that the media may be getting money to depict Muslims in a positive light.‚Äù 
The facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the SPLC: George Soros funded a report on ‚ÄúIslamophobia‚Äù on Twitter and gave $200,000 to the Center for American Progress for a defamatory report on alleged ‚ÄúIslamophobes.‚Äù He also spent $600,000 for favorable coverage of the Muslim migrant inundation, bought favorable coverage of the Iran deal , and bought ‚ÄúIslamophobia‚Äù propaganda after the San Bernardino jihad massacre. 
But what need does the SPLC have of facts? It knows its readers won‚Äôt check up on the veracity of its claims, but will accept them at face value, since the SPLC is of the camp of the saints, the enlightened and tolerant Left. Those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the SPLC feels bound to respect.";english;2016-10-28T07:55:00.267+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;The SPLC‚Äôs Libelous New Report on 'Anti-Muslim Extremists';0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/southern-poverty-law-center.jpg?itok=_-AuQOFE;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Raymond Ibrahim is a Shillman Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. 
Whenever Muslims engage in behavior that ostensibly contradicts Islam‚Äîfrom taking drugs and watching porn to killing fellow Muslims ‚ÄîIslam‚Äôs apologists loudly proclaim ‚ÄúAha, see, they‚Äôre not true Muslims!‚Äù Or, in the words of CIA head John Brennan on the Islamic State: ‚ÄúThey are terrorists, they‚Äôre criminals. Most‚Äîmany‚Äîof them are psychopathic thugs, murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct.‚Äù 
Overlooked is that many self-styled jihadis are indeed ‚Äúpsychopathic thugs, murderers‚Äù; some may not even believe in Allah at all. Yet this does not exonerate Islam, for its ‚Äúreligious construct‚Äù was designed to entice such men. 
As usual , this traces back to the prophet, Muhammad. After telling his followers that Allah had permitted Muslims four wives and limitless concubines (Koran 4:3), he later claimed that Allah had delivered a new revelation (Koran 33.51) permitting him, Muhammad alone, to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted. In response, his young wife Aisha quipped: ‚ÄúI feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires.‚Äù (Apostates from Islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet.) 
But it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites. For whoever fights in the name of Allah and/or seeks to empower Islam‚Äîthat is, jihadis/terrorists‚Äîis exonerated of all blame and, if he dies fighting, guaranteed the highest levels of paradise (where more sex awaits). 
That‚Äôs because Allah made a ‚Äúpact‚Äù with them. According to Koran 9:111: ‚ÄúAllah has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods, and in return has promised them Paradise: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain‚Ä¶. Rejoice then in the bargain you have struck, for that is the supreme triumph.‚Äù Muhammad elaborated: ‚ÄúLining up for battle in the path of Allah [jihad to empower Islam] is worthier than 60 years of worship.‚Äù Moreover, The martyr is special to Allah. He is forgiven from the first drop of blood [that he sheds]. He sees his throne in paradise‚Ä¶. He will wed the ‚Äòaynhour [supernatural, celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes] and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror [hell]. Fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor, a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains. And he will copulate with seventy-two ‚Äòaynhour. 
As for those Muslims who reject jihad, Muhammad said ‚Äúthey will be tortured like no other sinful human.‚Äù (For many more Islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking, one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise, see here .) 
There is no denying that the historic growth of Islam is related to its carnal incentives. After more than a decade of preaching in Mecca, Muhammad had about 100 followers, mostly relatives. It was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied. So long as such fighters helped spread the banner of Islam into infidel lands, they were deemed good and pious Muslims‚Äîregardless of their true intentions, priorities, or even faith. 
Many of the original jihadis now revered in Islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics. Consider Khalid bin al-Walid: a Meccan pagan, he opposed Muhammad for years; but when the prophet seized Mecca, Khalid‚Äîlike many of Muhammad‚Äôs foes, such as his archenemy, Abu Sufyan‚Äîexpediently converted, proclaimed the shahada , joined the winning team, and then went a-jihading‚Äîmutilating, plundering, raping, enslaving, crucifying, and setting people on fire in the process. But because he did so under the banner of jihad, this serial killer and rapist is today one of Islam‚Äôs most revered heroes. 
The reason for this is that nowhere in Islam is there talk about the ‚Äúcondition‚Äù of the jihadis‚Äô ‚Äúheart,‚Äù or if he‚Äôs ‚Äúright‚Äù with God. Allah is not God: he is not interested in ‚Äúhearts and minds‚Äù but in fighters and swords. So long as his fighters proclaim the shahada ‚Äî‚ÄúThere is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger‚Äù‚Äîand fight under the banner of Islam, they can take, plunder, murder, and rape the infidels; and if they die doing so, they go to paradise. 
Such was the genius of Muhammad: in the Arabian society he lived in, members of one‚Äôs tribe were as inviolable as non-members were free game, to be plundered, enslaved, or killed with impunity. Muhammad took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale. Henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world: the umma ‚Äîwhich consists of all Muslims, regardless of race‚Äîand the ‚Äúinfidels,‚Äù who deserve to be plundered, enslaved, or killed with impunity for rejecting Allah. 
This explains why other tribal/nomadic societies‚ÄîTurks and Mongols/Tatars, whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribe‚Äîalso converted to Islam and, under the banner of jihad, continued preying on the other, the infidel, but now as venerated ‚Äúchampions of the faith.‚Äù 
Christian Europe was aware of Islam‚Äôs true appeal from the very beginning. Theophanes the Byzantine scholar (d. 818) wrote the following about Muhammad in his chronicles: He taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemy‚Äîor being slain by the enemy‚Äîentered into paradise [see Koran 9:111]. And he said paradise was carnal and sensual‚Äîorgies of eating, drinking, and women. Also, there was a river of wine ‚Ä¶ and the women were of another sort, and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure long-enduring [e.g., Koran 56: 7-40, 78:31, 55:70-77]. And all sorts of other nonsense. 
Centuries later, St. Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) made similar observations: He [Muhamad] seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected; he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine‚Ä¶. Muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his arms‚Äîwhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants. What is more, no wise men, men trained in things divine and human, believed in him from the beginning. Those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all divine teaching, through whose numbers Mohammed forced others to become his follower's by the violence of his arms. 
There is, finally, another group of Muslims who should not be overlooked. These do not give a fig for Allah nor wish to be ‚Äúmartyred‚Äù in exchange for paradise, but they rely on Islam to justify robbing, enslaving, raping, and killing non-Muslims, as many Christian minorities in nations like Pakistan and Egypt will attest. Because their victims are just ‚Äúinfidels‚Äù‚Äîand it‚Äôs a sin to aid a non-Muslim against a Muslim (that is, a non-tribal member against a tribal member)‚ÄîMuslim criminals target non-Muslim minorities precisely because they know Muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels. 
In short, enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is, in the words of the CIA‚Äôs Brennan, ‚Äúterrorists,‚Äù ‚Äúcriminals,‚Äù ‚Äúpsychopathic thugs,‚Äù and ‚Äúmurderers.‚Äù Yes, they are. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is, as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad, paradise is assured them; and another group doesn‚Äôt care a bit about the afterlife, but knows that, as long as they only victimize ‚Äúinfidels,‚Äù no Muslim will hold them accountable. In both cases, Islam aids and abets their behavior.";english;2016-10-28T07:55:00.777+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;The Psychopathic and Insincere Jihad;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/lp_1.jpg?itok=3ClxpnGN;0;1;0;0;0;hate

By now it should be clear to all but the blindest (or rabidly disingenuous) that the United Nations is an organization that has been co-opted by the nefarious interests of Muslim nations and their despotic third world allies. It is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy. An organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as today's greatest purveyor of Judeophobia, historical revisionism and conspiracy theories. This fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that deny the indisputable Jewish nexus to the holy city. 
On April 12, the 58-member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly one-sided resolution that referred to Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem exclusively by their Muslim names and designated the Temple Mount, Judaism‚Äôs holiest site, as a ‚ÄúMuslim holy site of worship.‚Äù To add insult to injury, the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that Israel was ‚Äúplanting Jewish fake graves in other spaces of the Muslim cemeteries.‚Äù 
Unsurprisingly, the resolution, which was submitted by seven Muslim nations, passed by a wide margin with 33 votes in favor, six against and 17 abstentions. Two nations were absent for the vote. France, Sweden, Slovenia and Spain shamefully supported the vile resolution. 
That the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of Muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of UNESCO but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner European support and Israel could thus claim a moral victory. France with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the world‚Äôs despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble. 
But following the vote, a crack appeared in the fa√ßade of anti-Israel invective so prevalent at the U.N. It appeared that France was having a case of buyer‚Äôs remorse. In an address to the French parliament, Prime Minister Manuel Valls termed the resolution ‚Äúclumsy‚Äù and ‚Äúunfortunate.‚Äù He then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that ‚ÄúFrance will never deny the Jewish presence and Jewish history in Jerusalem. It would make no sense; it is absurd to deny this history.‚Äù 
France is one of Europe‚Äôs strongest advocates for the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority and their Muslim allies at UNESCO should have understood from Valls‚Äô statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic European support. Instead of declaring victory and moving on, they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in October. 
The October 13 resolution , sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the April resolution. It condemned Israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the Jewish (and Christian) nexus to the city. This time however, the Muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening. While the resolution passed, the Muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the 58-member body. 
Of the 24 nations that voted in favor of the resolution (Mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to 23), 14 were composed of states with Muslim majorities while a fifteenth, Nigeria, is 50 percent Muslim, making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion. What was notable was the fact that this time around, the resolution failed to garner a single western European concurrence. Other developing nations, like India, which had hitherto supported Arab-sponsored drafts also abstained. Israel‚Äôs behind-the-scenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the Muslim initiative was paying dividends. 
Following the resolution‚Äôs passage, the Palestinians and their Muslim allies suffered additional political reversals. Mexico , asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that his government‚Äôs changed position ‚Äúreiterates the recognition that the Government of Mexico gives the undeniable link of the Jewish people to the cultural heritage of East Jerusalem.‚Äù 
Brazil soon followed suit echoing Mexico‚Äôs position. In a statement, the Brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such one-sided resolutions. Italy, which had abstained, went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told an Italian radio station that these resolutions were ‚Äúincomprehensible, unacceptable and wrong.‚Äù He added that ‚Äúto say that the Jews have no links to Jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness.‚Äù 
Even UNESCO‚Äôs director-general, Irina Bokova voiced disapproval by stating that ‚Äúthe heritage of Jerusalem is indivisible, and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city.‚Äù She later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion. 
On Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan introduced a third draft resolution to UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage Committee seeking to generate further political terrorism. The proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the Jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites. The 21-member WHC body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move, Croatia and Tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the Muslim bloc. Instead of the motion passing by consensus, the vote was 10 in favor, two opposed, eight abstentions and one nation absent. 
The two nations opposing were Tanzania and the Philippines. Of the 10 ayes, seven were Muslim. It was a pyrrhic victory at best. 
Given the large number of Muslim countries represented at the U.N. and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against Israel, it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed. But as evidenced by recent Arab political reversals, gone are the days that the Palestinians can rely on automatic European and non-aligned support. 
Israel has been effectively reaching out to the so-called non-aligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact. Part of the Israeli success lies in the fact that the Jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology, agriculture, energy, counter-terrorism, cyber warfare and arms. This outreach has translated to political dividends at the U.N. 
Nevertheless, the UNESCO resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many U.N. member states. It also underscores the need for the United States to maintain its commitment and assurance to Israel that it will never allow the U.N. to impose terms and dictates on Israel. 
There have been rumors circulating that Barack Obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on Israel utilizing the UN Security Council. The White House has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation. 
The administration‚Äôs objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed anti-Israel resolution, likely introduced by France, or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto. In addition to betraying long-standing commitments to Israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition, the notion that the United States would throw Israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant anti-Semitism to have a say on Israel‚Äôs fate, is beyond asinine. Hopefully, the outrageous conduct exhibited at UNESCO steers the administration in the right direction.";english;2016-10-28T07:55:01.169+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;The Battle at UNESCO;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sw.jpg?itok=bxOjUWH-;0;1;0;0;0;hate

In one of the immortal lines of Godfather 2 , mafia boss Michael Corleone discusses the fate of his brother, who betrayed him, with his enforcer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive,‚Äù Corleone said. 
Message received. The brother was murdered after their mother‚Äôs funeral. Last week it was reported that the Obama administration has delivered a message to the Palestinian Authority. The administration has warned the PA that the US will veto any anti-Israel resolution brought before the UN Security Council before the US presidential elections on November 8. Message received. Open season on Israel at the Security Council will commence November 9. The Palestinians are planning appropriately. Israel needs to plan, too. Israel‚Äôs most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank President Barack Obama in his final eight weeks in power. Lobbying the administration is pointless. Obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on Israel for not supporting his hostile, strategically irrational policies. And he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones. Before turning to what Israel must do, first we need to understand what Israel can do. A good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at UNESCO, where twice in a week, UNESCO bodies resolved to erase 3,000 years of Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. The fight that Israel waged at UNESCO is not the fight it needs to wage at the Security Council. The stakes at the Security Council are far higher. Like the UN General Assembly, UNESCO‚Äôs decisions are non-binding declarations that have no legal or operational significance. As such, there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them. For Israel, the goal of the fight at UNESCO is not to defeat anti-Israel initiatives. That is impossible given the Palestinians‚Äô automatic majority. The purpose of the fight at UNESCO is to humiliate European governments that side with antisemitic initiatives, and to weaken the congenitally anti-Israel body itself. The government achieved both of these objectives. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi‚Äôs disavowal of his own government‚Äôs abstention from the vote on the first resolution ‚Äì like the similar position taken after the fact by the Mexican government ‚Äì was a diplomatic victory for Israel. So too, the fact that UNESCO‚Äôs own Secretary-General Irina Bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agency‚Äôs actions by rejecting the resolution‚Äôs denial of the Jewish people‚Äôs ties to Jerusalem was a significant victory for Israel. Her statement was deeply damaging for UNESCO and its reputation. Finally, the fact that Tanzania and the Philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to Israel‚Äôs capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional pro-Palestinian voting pattern. The Palestinians won the vote at UNESCO because they are more powerful diplomatically than Israel. They have an automatic anti-Israel majority. But they weren‚Äôt empowered by their victory. To the contrary. They were bloodied by it. In a sign of their weakening hold on member nations, the Palestinians and Jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of UNESCO‚Äôs World Heritage Committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution. Powerful players don‚Äôt make threats. They don‚Äôt need to. Israel‚Äôs experience at UNESCO teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers. Israel doesn‚Äôt need to hide in America‚Äôs shadow. It is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the Palestinians‚Äô automatic majority. And it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a US-backed assault at the Security Council. Unlike UNESCO, the Security Council can pass legally binding resolutions. Israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it. Obama‚Äôs intention to abandon Israel at the Security Council means that Israel comes to this battle severely hobbled. But there is one advantage to the US‚Äôs betrayal. Over the years, Israel‚Äôs ability to trust the US to veto anti-Israel resolutions at the Security Council was been a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the US has secured Israel from diplomatic assaults. But on the other hand, our ability to trust Washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective. Safe in Washington‚Äôs shadow, we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy. That is, we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys. But public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool. The Syrian regime, for instance, has no moral case for securing international support. Bashar Assad didn‚Äôt convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes. He bought Putin‚Äôs support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in Syria. Then there is Morocco, another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make. Last March, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon outraged Rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that Western Sahara, which Morocco occupies, is ‚Äúoccupied territory.‚Äù Morocco quickly secured the support of Spain and France and launched an all-out onslaught against Ban. How did Morocco manage? Morocco‚Äôs most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from North Africa to Europe. Anytime it wishes, Rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut. And the French and Spanish know it. In less than a month, Ban issued repeated abject apologies. Game. Set. Match. Morocco. From reports to date, it appears that shortly after the US elections on November 8, the Malaysians or Egyptians will submit a Palestinian-backed resolution that defines Israeli communities in united Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria as illegal. If the resolution is brought to a vote, the US will fail to veto it. Such a resolution, or a resolution obligating Israel to withdraw to the 1949 armistice lines, would cause Israel grave harm. So what resources does Israel have to prevent this from happening? Of course, we have public diplomacy. And that might work with some friendly nations. But it won‚Äôt get us over the top. We need to learn from the Syrian and Moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer Security Council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us. One such resource is the US Congress. Israel‚Äôs allies in Congress are sickened by the Obama administration‚Äôs devastating Middle East policies. A solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce Israel‚Äôs position. Israel has other resources as well that we can trade on. We have natural gas. And we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the 21 century. There is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support. As for the Palestinians, as the UNESCO vote showed, they are less popular now than at any time in the past 40 years. All they have to offer is threats and antisemitism. Both are powerful weapons. But they are no longer invincible. Israel‚Äôs goal must be to use our resources at the Security Council in a manner that will make it impossible for Obama to enable an anti-Israel resolution to pass. A method for achieving this goal has two components. The first component is to convince a friendly country on the Security Council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the Palestinian-backed Israel-bashing one. Such a resolution could include four points. First, it could deplore efforts to deny Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Second, it can condemn the PA/PLO for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists. Third, it can urge Israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future Palestinian state. Fourth, it can call on Israel and the PA to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions. Israel has friendly ties with a few Security Council members, among them Uruguay and New Zealand. In the final weeks of the Obama era, it is possible that Israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines. Obama would be hard-pressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles Israel out for rebuke. But that still is insufficient. Obama can make Uruguay and New Zealand a better offer if he wishes. And so we move to the second aspect of the plan. If we learn nothing else from the Obama era, we must recognize that the time has come for Israel to stop sufficing with just one Security Council veto. Most states have several. And we need a few more. Russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto. Putin is a dealmaker. As his agreement with Assad showed, he is willing to consider attractive offers. Obviously, Israel won‚Äôt offer Russia bases. But we do have other things to offer Putin in exchange for a veto. For instance, in exchange for a Russian veto at the Security Council, Israel can offer Putin to lobby the US Congress to cancel US sanctions against Russia over Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea. Israel has no dog in that fight. And the sanctions are not getting the US anywhere. Putin might go for the deal for two reasons. First, by stepping into the breach and defending Israel against Obama, he will humiliate Obama. Second, if Israel succeeds with the Congress, he will reap economic rewards. For his part, Putin wouldn‚Äôt even have to openly side with Israel. All he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability, Russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on Israel and the Palestinians. If Putin supports a balanced resolution, Obama will be checkmated. His plan to take revenge on Israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled. Israel will have survived his presidency. None of this will be easy. And success is far from assured. There are many more ways for Israel to fail than succeed. Our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck. But as the UNESCO resolutions showed, attacking Israel is no longer cost free. We are not powerless in the grip of circumstances. We have cards to play. And now is the time to play them for all they are worth.";english;2016-10-28T07:55:02.971+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Checkmating Obama;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/barack_obama_with_benjamin_netanyahu_in_the_oval_office_5-18-09_2.jpg?itok=OagIot3x;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Jonathan Haidt, a professor of social psychology at New York University, argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional ‚Äútelos‚Äù (end or goal) has been truth, within the last few decades the university has assumed another: Social Justice. 
The university, however, can only have one telos. 
The conflict between these two goals has raged for decades, Haidt claims. Last year, though, it became unmanageable when student groups at 86 universities and colleges around the country issued ‚Äú demands ‚Äù to administrators, demands for Social Justice that, by and large, were met. 
The following statement is posted at BlackLiberationCollective.org : 
‚ÄúWe demand at the minimum, Black students and Black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of Black folk in the state and the country. 
We demand free intuition for Black and indigenous students. 
We demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities.‚Äù 
A statement of ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù follows. The Black Liberation Collective (BLC) opposes ‚Äúanti-Blackness;‚Äù ‚Äúsexism;‚Äù ‚Äúableism;‚Äù ‚Äúcapitalism;‚Äù ‚ÄúWhite privilege;‚Äù ‚Äúinequality;‚Äù and ‚Äúheteronormativity.‚Äù It rejects as well non-violence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic . 
‚ÄúAnti-Black racism is woven in the fabric of our global society,‚Äù says the BLC. ‚ÄúWhen social systems are racialized by white supremacy, whiteness becomes the default of humanity and Blackness is stripped of its humanity, becoming a commodity, becoming disposable.‚Äù 
The BLC is ‚Äúanti-sexist‚Äù insofar as it affirms ‚Äúthe value of all Black women‚Äôs lives whether cisgender, transgender, or genderqueer.‚Äù In addition to rejecting ‚ÄúEurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of Black women and Black women‚Äôs features,‚Äù being ‚Äúanti-sexist‚Äù also means realizing that ‚Äúpolice brutality, the prison industrial system, school to prison pipeline‚Äù and the like are aspects of ‚Äústructural racism‚Äù that affect black women as much as they impact black men. 
Black liberation entails ‚Äúqueer liberation‚Äù and ‚Äútrans liberation.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize Black queer people,‚Äù the BLC asserts. The ‚Äúhomophobia‚Äù within ‚Äúthe Black community‚Äù comes by way of ‚Äúthe same hands responsible for white supremacy.‚Äù 
Presumably, ‚Äútransphobia‚Äù within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy. In cooperation with ‚Äúcissexism‚Äù and ‚Äúthe gender binary,‚Äù ‚Äútransphobia‚Äù has ‚Äúbeen used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans+ family members.‚Äù The BLC pledges to ‚Äúeliminate‚Äù such systemic biases. 
These Social Justice Warriors (SJWs) are staunch opponents of ‚Äúthe capitalist notions of infinite profit, homogenized markets, and a privatized means of production.‚Äù Capitalism, they insist, ‚Äúis the economic system‚Äù that‚Äôs been ‚Äúused to justify‚Äù the ‚Äúoppression,‚Äù ‚Äúmarginalization,‚Äù and ‚Äúexploitation‚Äù of blacks. 
Nor is the solution to this ‚Äúoppression‚Äù to be found in supporting black-owned businesses. The BLC explains that ‚Äúwe cannot adopt the patriarchal, exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation.‚Äù Rather, the solution is to ‚Äúdismantle anti-Black capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression.‚Äù 
It isn‚Äôt only the ‚Äúcapitalist corporations‚Äù that these students want destroyed. They demand as well ‚Äúthe eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community‚Äù and ‚Äúthe removal of all federal, state, and local government officials who do not abide by our principles.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe State and all its institutions that deny Black humanity and Black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce Black liberty.‚Äù 
Concerning its attitude toward America, the BLC is clear: ‚ÄúThis country was built to systematically oppress groups of people, and the Black Liberation Collective will not stand for it.‚Äù 
Haidt misspeaks in characterizing 2015 as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity, an unmanageable conflict of goals. To judge from the vast majority of liberal arts, humanities, and social sciences departments, Social Justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison d‚Äôetre of the academy. Interestingly, it is these SJW demands from last year that bear this out. 
Perhaps it is because I‚Äôve spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that I may be more privy to this than are some others, but it‚Äôs painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own. If they didn‚Äôt have their professors actually write the demands for them, then the Black Liberation Collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors. 
To put it bluntly, one must attend college, major in the liberal arts and humanities, and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of Social Justice Warriors. 
Leftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will. This is the first point. There is, though, another, a rich irony that is lost upon these self-styled radicals. 
For all of their bluster over ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù and ‚Äústructural white supremacy,‚Äù i.e. phenomena that are omnipresent and, hence, largely unconscious, these black students, their white collaborators, and their professors fail to realize that their thinking (for lack of a better term) on these issues is about as Eurocentric as one can get. The ‚Äú critical race theory ‚Äù to which the BLC subscribe is a version of Marxism, the philosophical vision of a 19 th century German-Jewish man. The Marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men. 
But there‚Äôs more to it than this. 
The idea that ‚Äúracism,‚Äù ‚Äúsexism,‚Äù ‚Äúhomophobia,‚Äù ‚Äútransphobia,‚Äù ‚Äúableism,‚Äù and the like against which SJWs rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of European civilization. If these ‚Äúisms‚Äù and ‚Äúphobias‚Äù are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual. Color, gender, sexual orientation, ability, and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individual‚Äîbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted. 
Yet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as Eurocentric as the proverbial ‚Äúapple pie‚Äù is American. 
The Social Justice Warriors‚Äô intellectual landscape is as much a European ‚Äúcolony‚Äù as was any West African country in the 19 th or early 20 th centuries. Those in the Black Liberation Collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their ‚Äúoppressor.‚Äù 
Now, they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in Social Justice.";english;2016-10-28T07:55:05.430+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Social Justice vs. Truth;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/fd_1.jpg?itok=7y-_ZzGe;0;1;0;0;0;hate

In recent interviews, Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump, observed wryly that almost every malicious, lie-filled article about herself or he husband was written by a ‚Ä¶ female. Indeed, women seem to have a particular stake in bringing Mr. Trump down. 
The contrast between Mrs. Trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark. In both her interviews with CNN's condescending Anderson Cooper and Fox News's Ainsley Earhardt, Mrs. Trump was the embodiment of ""strength."" 
When a liberal woman declares she's a strong woman (usually uttered in a tart-like, staccato inflection), she's using a clich√©. Look at her actions. You'll see that ""strong"" to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways. 
A ""strong"" liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to fork-out for her Trojans and her Trivora. And if birth control fails our liberated libertine, then you're on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients. And don't dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man, any man. To doubt her is to harm her. 
It was not without significance that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs first general election speech, in June, was before Planned Parenthood. At the time, media buried the story of one named Rajiv K. Fernando , who had donated to the Clinton Foundation and was given a seat as Hillary‚Äôs nuclear weapons advisor. Watching this, I was thinking endemic corruption, the $19 trillion debt, the dire jobs report, the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers. But Hillary and her gyno-brigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayer-paid dilation and curettage (D&C). 
Melania Trump, on the other hand, is authentically strong. 
In her refusal to impart salacious tell-all tidbits to interviewers, in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family; in her serene, gracious, and beautiful manners and bearing‚ÄîMrs. Trump exemplifies a European woman's good breeding. She's a class act. Her enemies are the cultural underclass. 
Nor does Mrs. Trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her American counterparts. There are images on the Internet of presidents being inappropriate with women. In particular, you can watch a grainy YouTube clip of Barack Obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters. In another, the president, with France's Nicolas Sarkozy, is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by. Much to media chagrin, Melania refused to get worked up about the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in locker-room talk. 
Men will be men. If they're not saying it; they're thinking it. 
More material than her mien were Melania Trump's words of reason. On the Soviet-style witch-hunt launched against her husband with media mediation, she said this: ‚ÄúAll sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law. To accuse someone, man or woman, without evidence is damaging and unfair.‚Äù This was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney Tom Mesereau, about the Bill Cosby pile-on. Quit the feeding frenzy. Give the man his due process. Investigate the women, counseled Mesereau, Esq., at the time. 
The very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted Michelle Obama. The First Lady was lauded for an unhinged anti-Trump address to the nation's women. In a world where Americans have been beheaded on camera, women raped en masse on Europe's streets, and Christians exterminated in the Middle East‚Äîthe First Lady bewailed being ""shaken"" to her shallow core by raunchy words. ""I can't stop thinking about it,"" groaned Michelle about Mr. Trump's Access Hollywood indiscretion. It ""has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted."" 
The ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a Catholic priest by Muslim migrants in France: That's something ""I can't stop thinking about."" The machine-gunning of five Macy's shoppers and employees by a Turkish Muslim immigrant (Arcan Cetin), in my neck of the woods: That ""has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted."" Again, Mrs. Obama's pitiful case against Mr. Trump has strengthened nothing but her drama-queen credentials. 
Candidate Clinton crowed that Mrs. Obama's long whinge for women was a ""compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election, about who we are as Americans."" Indeed, the implicit case Michelle put to women is this: a mammoth national debt, a shrinking job market, rising lawlessness and racial strife, an annual intake of mostly Third-World immigrants exceeding 3 million, the dangers to life and limb of importing more Islam: fuhgeddaboudit. What counts, whimpered Michelle Obama, voice trembling‚Äîyes, Mrs. Obama almost brought herself to tears‚Äîwas to ferret out microaggression, and find a safe-place to hunker down. 
As I write, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has stormed a stage somewhere for Hillary Clinton. Phony Pocahontas is hollering about the power of ""nasty women"" to immiserate. Clinton and Warren make for a resentful, domineering, power-hungry pair, who‚Äôve made it big in life through the use of state power. The human backdrop to their displays of female force invariably looks the same. 
Whereas Trump rallies are packed with hope-filled, beaming faces; a Clinton-Warren affair is festooned with malevolent-looking, aggrieved women and their frightened, low-T houseboys. The background music: enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop ‚Äúsinger‚Äù like Katy Perry, whose out-of-tune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard, if not for the marvel of Auto-Tune. (Auto-Tune is the ‚Äúholy grail of recording‚Äù that ‚Äúcorrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments, in real time, without distortion or artifacts.‚Äù It was invented by a male engineer.) 
Shudder. 
If this melodramatic, neurotic message is the voice of America's women‚Äîand legions of Republican women have seconded it‚Äîthen count me with HER, with Melania.";english;2016-10-28T07:55:06.853+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Against Hillary's Malevolent Matriarchy;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/nm_1.jpg?itok=2YWPFbXh;0;1;0;0;0;hate

October 28, 2016 
Reprinted from NyTimes.com. 
She leads a clandestine existence, on the move and under 24-hour guard as France‚Äôs most protected woman. Yet Zineb El Rhazoui, the Charlie Hebdo journalist who happened to be in Casablanca on January 7 last year, the day terrorists ‚Äúavenging the Prophet‚Äù massacred nine people at the satirical magazine in Paris, believes she has a duty to defy Islamists desperate to silence her. 
Shaken but undeterred by the fatwas and relentless, precise death threats issued via social media to ‚Äúkill the bitch‚Äù since she helped produce the publication‚Äôs first survivors‚Äô issue following the attack ‚Äî and spoke about it in Arabic for the Arab press ‚Äî the Moroccan-French writer refuses to assume an anonymous identity. Fleeing Paris or abandoning her human rights activism, and her unforgiving critiques of the religion she grew up with, are also out of the question. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the right to renounce my struggle, or to give up my freedom,‚Äù says the reporter and sociologist of religion in an interview with Women in the World, during a recent trip to New York, as part of French president Francois Hollande‚Äôs delegation when he received the Appeal of Conscience Foundation‚Äôs World Statesman Award for 2016. ‚ÄúIf the French state protects me it is not little individual me: What is being protected is my freedom to be irreverent, and freedom of expression, so I should exercise this even more because I enjoy this protection.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs totally crazy. I have done nothing against the law and have nothing to hide, yet I live with security while those who threaten us are free,‚Äù El Rhazoui declares with an air of shock and anger that underscores the arbitrariness and brutality visited on a 34-year-old woman condemned to living on the run and mostly in the shadows. ‚ÄúAnd if you call them by their names you are Islamophobic and racist. I am racist? I can teach them a few things about Arab culture. I can show them how to discover its richness and the diversity of their culture. I believe this culture deserves universality because you can be Arab, Muslim and a free thinker.‚Äù 
Resisting terror 
Sweeping in to the offices of Women in the World in Manhattan, accompanied by bodyguards, the world-renowned journalist is living proof of her pledge to keep ‚Äúliving her life beyond its limits‚Äù as a key way of resisting terror. Elegant and beautiful, with her long, wavy hair flowing freely and in an impeccably tailored black dress, El Rhazoui is reminiscent of 1940s cinema‚Äôs cerebral heroines ‚Äî her eloquence and composure only occasionally betraying the trauma of the past 20 months. Each time we speak about the aftermath of the massacre at her magazine and how she is coping personally her voice quavers, but when the subject comes back to her fight for reform in Islamic civilization she is fearless. 
In this spirit, El Rhazoui, obliged to spend most of her time in hiding, like Salman Rushdie after his 1989 publication of The Satanic Verses , has taken the high-risk option of publishing an explosive new book about Islam. 
Detruire Le Fascisme Islamique ( Destroy Islamic Fascism ), being released in France this week, takes the battle of ideas directly to the ideologically-driven zealots who inspired the assassins of her dear friend Charb (Stephane Charbonnier), late editor of Charlie Hebdo who preferred ‚Äúto die standing than to live on my knees.‚Äù 
Obtained exclusively by Women in the World, the book dedicated to ‚ÄúMuslim atheists‚Äù is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of Islam by imitating the first Salafists or ‚Äúpious ancestors.‚Äù The Prophet Mohammed and his companions, whose violent exploits are contained in ‚Äúbellicose texts from a barbaric 7th-century Bedouin tribal context,‚Äù exhibited codes of behavior El Rhazoui insists have no place in the modern world and can be directly connected to terrorism. ‚ÄúThe most abject crimes of Islamic State are but a 21st-century remake of what the first Muslims accomplished under the guidance of the Prophet,‚Äù she writes, noting that sexual and domestic slavery, the massacre of non-Muslims (notably Jews), pedophilia, pillage, polygamy and summary executions were all adopted from pre-Islamic societies. The book is also the journalist‚Äôs way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades, who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere ‚Äî with Islam no exception to their traditional French anti-clerical ridicule ‚Äî through satire and caricature. 
Formerly the magazine‚Äôs religion writer, El Rhazoui is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management. Flush with cash from international donations, the fundamentally altered publication, she disappointedly explained, ‚Äú will probably never again draw the Prophet ‚Äù out of fear of more reprisals. 
‚Äú[And] those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of Mohammed forget that everywhere that Islam reigns as the religion of the state, caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed‚Äù. El Rhazoui‚Äôs book, dedicated to ‚ÄúMuslim atheists,‚Äù is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of Islam. Religion of peace and love? 
‚ÄúWe need to admit that Islamism today is applied Islam,‚Äù El Rhazoui ‚Äî who describes herself as an ‚Äúatheist of Muslim culture‚Äù ‚Äìwrites, responding to politicians, religious figures, Islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that ‚Äúreal Islam‚Äù has nothing to do with such terror. 
‚ÄúWhen we apply Islam to the letter it gives Islamism, and when we apply Islamism to the letter it gives terrorism. So we need to stop saying Islam is a religion of peace and love. What is a moderate Islamist? An Islamist who doesn‚Äôt kill?‚Äù 
The essay-length book is in the grand French polemical tradition of Emile Zola whose J‚Äôaccuse denounced the anti-Semitism of the French state and establishment during the Dreyfus Affair, on the eve of the 20th century. El Rhazoui, who holds Moroccan and French citizenship, takes aim at a very 21st-century phenomenon: what she abhors as the ‚Äúintellectual fraud‚Äù of Islamophobia, which pretends to be about anti-racism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of Islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all Muslims. Epitomized by the French Collective Against Islamophobia (CCIF), this deliberate strategy vilifies as Islamophobic voices such as El Rhazoui‚Äôs who dare question the religion the CCIF and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism. 
The notion of Islamophobia doesn‚Äôt even exist in Muslim countries, the author points out, because outside the West, criticism of the religion or Mohammed is officially ‚Äúcategorized as blasphemy.‚Äù 
‚ÄúUnable to pass blasphemy laws in Europe, groups like the CCIF employ a dangerous ‚Äúsemantic confusion,‚Äù she said. On the CCIF site it is written ‚ÄúIslamophobia is not an opinion: it is an offense.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThis is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards Islam and Muslims. Yet criticism of an idea, of Islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime. I was born and lived under the Islam of Morocco and live in France and I have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of Islamophobia that says I have no right to criticize! If we criticize Christianity it doesn‚Äôt mean we are Christianophobes or racist towards the ‚ÄòChristian race.‚Äô‚Äù 
The widespread pressure to self-censor is severe, El Rhazoui says. 
‚ÄúYou can no longer speak about Islam without saying it‚Äôs a religion of peace and love. But when you open any book in Islam what do you find? Violence, blood, oppression of women and hate for other religions. 
‚ÄúOf course you can find this in other religions, however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity. As long as we don‚Äôt talk about this, and keep repeating that Islam is a religion of peace and love, many people will continue to believe the Koran is a constitution, and that rather than being a book written 15 centuries ago reflecting a particular context, it is a legal constitution to apply today.‚Äù 
Zineb El Rhazoui feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead Charlie Hebdo comrades. 
After completing high school in Morocco, El Rhazoui studied languages and the sociology of religion, obtaining a Master‚Äôs degree from Paris‚Äôs prestigious social science graduate school EHESS. In her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at Le Journal Hebdomadaire, becoming a campaigner for secular liberties, such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of Ramadan. This act of non-violent resistance earned her her first fatwa, ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the Arab Spring in 2011. The wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against Ramadan rules prompted her to leave Morocco again for France where she began to report for Charlie Hebdo, bringing her memories of having ‚Äúvomited up compulsory religious classes‚Äù in a country where ‚Äúbeing Muslim is not a choice‚Äù unless you‚Äôre Jewish or Christian. 
Extreme personality cult 
So-called Islamic fascism, seen in its most extreme form in groups like ISIS, shares characteristics in common with all extreme-right fascisms, El Rhazoui argues, because it combines an intense personality cult around Mohammed as the incarnation of the nation. It also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation, exemplified by ‚Äúsartorial branding‚Äù ‚Äî for example Burkinis or niqabs ‚Äî that allow for immediate identification and targeting of non-adherents. There are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals, armed militias, adoption of a flag, and a strategy that confers the benign status of ‚ÄòMuslim women‚Äô to heavily veiled adherents in the West, and characterizes them, disingenuously, as victimized objects of exclusion. 
‚ÄúThe literary corpus of Islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma,‚Äù El Rhazoui writes. 
‚ÄúIf the terrorists of Daesh [ISIS] behead those they judge to be miscreants, that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the 8th surah of the Koran, al-Anfal, verse 12: ‚ÄúRemember what Your Lord revealed to the angels : I am with you, so support those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. You can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip‚Äù. 
‚ÄòYou can be Arab, Muslim and a free thinker‚Äô 
Drawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of Islam‚Äôs core Arabic texts, the politics of the post-Arab Spring Middle East, and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multi-faceted Islamic civilization, El Rhazoui‚Äôs book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politico-religious repression dead. 
The greatest racism is, El Rhazoui argues, the racism of the Islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not Muslims, and that rejects women. ‚ÄúThat is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it,‚Äù the writer adds. 
‚ÄúToday Islam in the world only has a role as a civilization. A civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion ‚Äî but also by its geographical heritage, its artistic, culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature. 
‚ÄúThe Muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today: universal principles of equality between men and women, sexual and individual freedom, and equality for all, no matter your creed or religion. Until Islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it, Islam will not be acceptable.‚Äù 
‚ÄòIslamophobia whiners‚Äô 
Destroy Islamic Fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and faux-intellectual ‚Äúfakery‚Äù (the author‚Äôs word) of ‚ÄúIslamophobia whiners‚Äù and other ‚Äúcollaborationists‚Äù from across the political spectrum ‚Äî particularly the hard left, ‚ÄúCrypto-Islamist‚Äù anti-racists on a quest for a new ‚ÄúMuslim proletariat,‚Äù certain feminists, cultural relativists and so-called moderate Imams. All these ‚Äúwilling accomplices‚Äù do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of Islamic State, the author says, but also makes the lives of millions of Muslims living in Islamic countries downright miserable. 
‚ÄúWhat do these Islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in Islamic theocracies and dream of liberty?‚Äù El Rhazoui concludes in her book. ‚ÄúWho speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of Algiers, Casablanca or Cairo in a skirt?‚Ä¶ those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it? ‚Ä¶ about homosexuals, pariahs of Muslim societies, who often only have the choice of death, prison or exile? Who speaks about this youth born Muslim but dreaming of a normal life, these teens attacked for having had a romance?‚Äù 
The summer furore over Burkini bans in France agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of Islamists and their Western sympathizers in the media, academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of ‚Äúliberation‚Äù and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by ‚ÄúMuslim women,‚Äù even though most never wear it. 
‚ÄúWestern media, in an intolerable readiness to oblige, have defended the Burkini as a ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity,‚Äù she said, but pointed out that ‚Äúin Muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with Burkinis, but they are emptying themselves of women. From one year to another, they are disappearing from the public space, because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior.‚Äù 
As for mainstream or moderate Muslim clerics, El Rhazoui tells Women in the World that during the Burkini debate in France not one Imam stood up and said ‚ÄúHey, wait a minute, you can be Muslim and wear a [regular] bathing suit.‚Äù 
History will judge those who have monopolized the debate, given a platform to Islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability, the author of Destroy Islamic Fascism told Women in the World. ‚ÄúThis is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today,‚Äù she said. 
According to the writer, who is repeatedly accused of bigotry, the ‚ÄúIslamophobia ruse‚Äù is driven by ‚Äúgreat ignorance‚Äù and a lack of understanding of the culture of Islam and what Islam with a big ‚ÄòI‚Äô is ‚Äî ‚Äúthey ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe accomplices don‚Äôt recognize the struggles playing out today in Arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people. No fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history. The people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability.‚Äù 
For El Rhazoui the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to Islamic culture that decrees an Islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her ‚Äúrace‚Äù is the burqa. ‚ÄúWe present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture. It is absolutely intolerable,‚Äù she says. 
Survivor syndrome 
Women in the World asked El Rhazoui how she manages to keep up her spirits, and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since January 2015. 
‚ÄúIt is a question people often ask me,‚Äù she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice. ‚ÄúBut when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death, you realize can put many things in perspective. 
‚ÄúStraight after the attacks, like many of my colleagues I felt guilty for having stayed alive. I said to myself ‚ÄòThose who are dead are dead for all our work, and some are dead when it wasn‚Äôt even their work. But it was my work because I am a journalist and I am still here.‚Äô And then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome, which is normal when you survive a massacre like that. 
‚ÄúAs you start to heal you say, ‚ÄòI am lucky to be alive and if I am still here perhaps that is because I still have something to do.‚Äô I understood long before the attack on Charlie, when I engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in Morocco, that when you fight against totalitarianism, whether it is political or religious, you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living. We fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life.

Still a day doesn‚Äôt go past when she doesn‚Äôt think of her old colleague Charb and their many heated discussions. 
‚ÄúHe was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear. He was a true humanist who didn‚Äôt fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd.‚Äù 
El Rhazoui‚Äôs deconstruction of Islam is also a defense of Muslims, she reasoned, as ‚Äúsalvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe have to extend a hand to all these Muslims who are free people, who have questioned their heritage, and who are fighters for liberty, battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by Islamists,‚Äù she says. 
Life in a moving jail 
Since January 2015, the survivor from Charlie Hebdo has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the Freedom Forum, in Europe and the U.S., under the protection assured by the French state and the countries that receive her. She says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed, because so many other writers and political figures around the world ‚Äî and especially in Islamist-controlled or influenced countries ‚Äî are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security. 
‚ÄúI always find some spaces of freedom. There are always little escape hatches. Life continues!‚Äù says the woman who has just written her second book since the Charlie attacks, and recently became a first-time mother, in what she laughingly called the surprise ‚Äúbaby boom‚Äù at a publication that used to have ‚Äúone of the lowest birthrates in French media.‚Äù 
‚ÄúToday I wander around in a moving jail ‚Äî it‚Äôs a moving cage ‚Äî but in reality I am more free in my head than those who threaten me. Because their cage is inside their head. They have this cage in their brain and even if they have freedom of movement it is their spirit and their reason and intelligence that is imprisoned. I am much freer than them.‚Äù

Reprinted from IsraelNationalNews.com . 
Commendably, organized American Jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott, de-legitimize, and sanction Israel. However, focusing primarily on Israel, and not also on America and Europe, is short-sighted. 
The BDS campaign has not devastated Israel economically. Israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliances‚Äîbut fifty years of a well-funded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed Israel's good name and has rendered her and Jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic, academic, and mob attacks. 
It has also lowered the standards for truth among Americans. This is a very important point. 
An Islamic-style of Jew hatred has merged with Western, politically correct anti-racism to breed an unnatural passion for ""Palestinians,"" (Fakestinians), which has infiltrated every corner, every crevice of our lives and world. It has infected Americans and Europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class, race, and ethnicity. 
This is utterly astounding, amazing really; something like this does not happen overnight. 
The BDS campaign is rooted in the Arab League, PLO, and Soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mid-1960s. In the mid-1970s, the UN proposed its infamous Zionism=Racism resolution. 
In 1967, the day after Israel won yet another war of self-defense, Israel--not the Arab aggressors--was seen as the alleged ""occupier."" 
By the late 1970‚Äôs, Edward Said's treacherous, lying work had begun to have its way with Western academics, (and with Western-style academics in Israel), European governments, and international organizations. 
I only realized how successful his campaign was in 1980, when Israel was demonized at a UN conference on Women in Copenhagen. The Soviets, the Iranians, the Arab League, the PLO-- roamed the hallways chanting ""Death to Israel;"" European feminists called upon ""Palestinian"" refugees but refused to hear Jewish-Israeli refugees from Arab and Muslim countries. By 2001, the UN World Conference Against Racism in Durban was an even more out-of-control Hate Fest and riot against Israel. 
As we approach 2017, UN Resolutions against Israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque. UNESCO‚Äôs recent decision to De-Judaize Jerusalem, the Western Wall, and the First and Second Temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend. At the same time, pro-Israel professors and students in America are increasingly being harassed, even fired. 
Such Lies have infiltrated my private social world. For example: At a recent holiday dinner, our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism, no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink. 
A like-minded gathering, yes? Not exactly. One man, a genial, well-heeled, well-educated Jewish-American suddenly began hectoring us about the ""Palestinians."" ""What if they did not hate the Jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize Jews and Israelis? What if they were peaceful? Wouldn't we have to admit that Palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own? You can't deny that the Palestinian people have always lived there, can you?"" Oh my. Where to start? The company included two author-scholars who, between them, have published 15 books and thousands of articles, many of them dealing with the history and nature of Islam, tribal gender and religious apartheid, Israel, and anti-Semitism, etc. Among us was a third author, who had also served four tours of duty in the IDF. I held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table. This man was punching way above his pay grade and I could not understand why. 
The two author-scholars presented facts, cited statistics. I pulled down book after book from my shelves. We got nowhere. ""Look,"" he said. ""I have some really good Muslim friends, they're Americans, totally Westernized, they are Palestinians. They strongly feel that this is their identity. Why deny them the identity of their choice?"" And then I understood that the pro-Palestinian/anti-Zionist propaganda behind the relentless BDS campaign is successful precisely because so many Americans of all ages, are without knowledge; without respect for knowledge; do not know this; and frankly, don't care. 
""Fair is fair,"" he said. In other words: What's good for the Jews has to be good for everyone else. If not, the Jews don't deserve whatever it is either. 
Here's a man who's not an anti-Semite or an anti-Zionist; not an active member of any organization--yet who needs to believe the canard that non-Jewish ""Palestinians"" have always existed; or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than 1948, the year that another stateless people--the Jews--chose a national sovereign identity. 
He would not listen to reason. It was quite astounding. How is this possible? 
His mind-set is part of our ruling American zeitgeist. If Rachel Dolezal can say she's ""black"" even when she's ""white"" and direct a chapter of the NAACP; if a man can say that he's really a woman, trapped in a man's body; if all truth(s) are ""relative;"" if everything is ""subjective;"" if objectivity is no longer important; if doctored narratives have supplanted fact-based histories; if revisionism is preferred to truth--then, yes, anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they ""feel"" or ""believe"" that they do. 
I am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such, is a great enemy; that educated people have been especially vulnerable to False Ideas; that, psychologically speaking, we must approach them as if they've been brainwashed by a cult. 
Facts alone will not work. We must consider all known techniques for de-programming. 
This is one of our greatest challenges.";english;2016-10-28T07:55:10.308+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Pro-Palestinian Propaganda Lowering Standards of Truth in America;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/bds_1.jpg?itok=oj5lXTy9;0;1;0;0;0;hate

There's only one possible solution. 
Let's load $400 million in unmarked foreign currency on an unmarked cargo plane and deliver it to Iran, Then make follow that up with a few more. And make sure Iran scores $150 billion in sanctions relief. 
That's how we got here . It's SmartPower, which is neither smart nor powerful. 
Earlier this month US Navy ships had to fire defensive interceptor missiles after they were targeted by attacks launched from Houthi-controlled Yemen. 
This was likely the first time in history the Navy had to take such measures, and officials are now saying they think Iran is behind the attacks. 
""We believe that Iran is connected to this,"" Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan told NBC News. In fact, the US has intercepted many shipments of weapons from Iran to the Houthi militants, who oppose Yemen's internationally recognized government in a conflict that has seen thousands of civilian deaths and mass starvation of the civilian population. 
The intercepted shipments ""were filled with coastal defense cruise missiles, boats that we believe were explosive boats, other weapons that were clearly on the decks of their ships that we saw,"" Donegan said. 
I'm sure there's no chance that the billions Obama lavished on Iranian jihadists have in any way freed up the terror state to open its own Jihadi candy store. Not a chance. 
And I'm sure that when Iran gets the nuclear weapons that Obama is enabling, it will use them as responsibly as it's using its cruise missiles.";english;2016-10-28T14:52:36.662+03:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;US Navy: Iran Giving Terrorists Missiles to Fire at US Ships;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/nuclear_explosion_obama_2.jpg?itok=4reeK5x8;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Having never read any medieval German folk tales, Hillary Clinton is counting her chickens before they've hatched and preparing to hand out jobs that no one has handed her to hand out. She's busy planning her fantasy cabinet for her fantasy administration. 
And her big pick makes sense. 
Reportedly she would like to make Joe Biden the Secretary of State. Biden is the obvious choice. He's arrogant, dumb and brimming with bright ideas like just giving Iran money or splitting Iraq into little pieces. Obviously this wouldn't be a competency pick. The last time we had someone qualified as Secretary of State was during President Bush's time in office. 
Then Democrats decided they would give the job as a consolation prize to failed presidential candidates. Because our foreign policy is just that important. 
And who could be counted on to make an even bigger mess than Hillary Clinton or John Kerry... Joe Biden. It's a perfect plan. If you want a fall guy to blame everything on, they don't come any more obvious than Joe Biden. 
And if you want someone shadowed by the soft bigotry of low expectations, you've gotta go Joe.

Obama Inc. has a lot more luck with the media than it does with trials. Its lynchings of police officers have not gotten very far. Baltimore was the biggest and most resounding defeat. But it wasn't the only one. And the vastly differing treatment of the Bundy protesters and the Dakota pipeline protesters, from killing to government backing, have not had their intended effect. 
Instead Obama lost at trial. Again. 
This time it's the Bundy case. That was when the left realized it hated civil disobedience, just before rediscovering it again when it came to environmental protests. But big gov lost this one . Again. 
A jury Thursday delivered a stunning across-the-board acquittal to the leaders and participants in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation and a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement led by a Nevada family to open public lands to ranchers, miners and loggers. 
The verdicts finding Ammon Bundy, older brother Ryan Bundy and five others not guilty of a federal conspiracy drew elation from defense attorneys who spent five weeks arguing that the armed takeover amounted to a time-honored tradition of First Amendment protest and civil disobedience. 
The high-profile case riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the isolated bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. The jury's decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the land-rights movement. 
It means that Big Green Gov will have to think twice next time around. Or do a much better job of picking a jury. 
The Oregon prosecutors sat silently in front of their boss, U.S Attorney Billy Williams, and the head of the FBI in Oregon, Greg Bretzing, as the judge announced the ""not guilty'' pleas one by one. 
But it was quickly back to more of the same. 
ut the trial fireworks weren't quite over. A brawl broke out at the very end, when six to seven U.S. marshals surrounded Ammon Bundy's lawyer as he stood before the judge, arguing and shouting for his client to walk out the door a free man. They tackled him and stunned him with a Taser gun. As Mumford yelled, ""What are you doing?,'' U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown ordered, ""Everybody out of the courtroom!'' 
""All I was asking for was papers,'' Mumford said after emerging from federal custody nearly two hours later.

We're talking about ""Tehran Joe"" Biden of course who is good pals with the Iran Lobby. Biden is reportedly Hillary's fantasy cabinet pick for Secretary of State. Because the Democrats have decided that Secretary of State is a job too important to be trusted to experienced diplomats, but should instead be reserved strictly as a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates. 
Here's a flashback on Biden's views . 
Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joe Biden was quoted Monday as telling senior Israeli officials behind closed doors that the Jewish state will have to reconcile itself to a nuclear Iran. In the unsourced report, Army Radio also quoted Biden as saying that he opposed ""opening a additional military and diplomatic front."" Army Radio said Israeli officials expressed ""amazement"" over the remarks attributed to him. ""Israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of Iran,"" Army Radio quoted Biden as telling the unnamed officials. 
Biden's people loudly denied the report, but he had a history of being tight w ith the Iran Lobby. 
Some might call it reaching out to American Muslims. But to many Iranians living in California, a fund-raiser for Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) at the home of a prominent pro-Iran lobbyist on Feb. 19 sent a wrongheaded message to the ruling clerics in Tehran. 
""When we learned that Sen. Biden was planning to hold a fund-raiser at the California home of Dr. Sadegh Namazi-khah, we immediately contacted his office to express our dismay,"" a prominent Iranian-American activist tells Insight. Why dismay? 
""Dr. Namazi-khah is well-known in the Los Angeles area for his support of the ruling clerical regime in Tehran and is one of the regime's leading unofficial lobbyists in America. We thought that Sen. Biden might not know his background. Getting the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to appear at this event will certainly be seen by the regime in Tehran as a show of support."" 
On the eve of the fund-raiser, which brought an estimated $30,000 into Biden's re-election coffers, a Biden staffer told the activist that the senator's staff ""had all the facts necessary to make a decision,"" and he was planning to attend the fund-raiser despite the protests. 
Several participants who paid to attend the event tell Insight that Biden arrived at 8 p.m., stayed until 11 and delivered a sweeping condemnation of President George W. Bush's ""Axis of Evil"" formula. 
As Senator, Biden was not only undermining Bush, but fundraising off it at the home of supporters of a terrorist enemy state. 
Biden also impressed many of those present with his friendly attitude toward the Islamic Republic of Iran. The senator said that ""Iran always wanted to be an ally of the United States and to have good relations with the U.S.,"" according to Housang Dadgostar, a prominent lawyer. ""As Iranian-Americans, we don't want anything to happen to the Iranian government or to the Iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism,"" says Mohsen Movaghar, a Los Angeles businessman. Both men belong to the 70-member board of directors of Namazi-khah's Iranian Muslim Association of North America (IMAN). 
Namazi-khah denied any official contact with the Iranian government. But he tells Insight that he regularly travels to Iran ‚Äî something many expatriates do ‚Äî and that he actively supports ""moderates"" within the ruling clergy, such as Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, in their efforts to bring reform to the Islamic system. 
Namazi-khah and other IMAN board members say Biden's office contacted them to inquire if they would hold a private fund-raiser for the senator, who is up for re-election this year, after meeting with them at a pro-Tehran gala in New York last December. That event was sponsored by the American-Iranian Council (AIC), a pro-regime lobbying group trying to get Congress and the Bush administration to lift the trade embargo on Iran. 
But Biden had the perfect post 9/11 reaction . 
After September 11th, Biden Suggested Sending $200 Million To Iran, ""No Strings Attached,"" As A Gesture Of Good Faith To The Arab World. 
""At the Tuesday-morning meeting with committee staffers, Biden launches into a stream-of-consciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing, before he finally admits the obvious: 'I'm groping here.' Then he hits on an idea: America needs to show the Arab world that we're not bent on its destruction. 
'Seems to me this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for $200 million to Iran' Biden declares. 
He surveys the table with raised eyebrows, a How do ya like that? look on his face.""

You may remember Ambassador Samantha Power from the time she proposed invading Israel. Since then she's gone on to a glorious career of representing the Castro regime at the UN. Or is it the Obama regime. It naturally gets confusing when the US Ambassador to the UN sides with the enemy against her own country. 
""For more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain. [Applause.] Thank you."" 
Under Obama, Power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the United States. And they say Obama is some sort of anti-American traitor. I don't see it. If he were, we would be seeing signs of it by now. 
Anyway, Power then went on to audition for the job of the UN ambassador from Cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal Communist dictatorship about our human rights are well-founded... 
""Let me be among the first to acknowledge ‚Äì as our Cuban counterparts often point out ‚Äì that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust.""

The media is shamelessly spinning this corrupt behavior by Attorney General Lynch as standard protocol and blasting the FBI from deviating from some imaginary standard in which Democratic presidential candidates are supposed to be immune from the consequences of their criminality . And Congress is meant to be kept in the dark. 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates disagreed with FBI Director James Comey's decision to notify Congress about his bureau's review of emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton's personal server, law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said. 
There was no direct confrontation between Lynch or Yates and Comey. Instead, the disagreements were conveyed to Comey by Justice Department staff, who advised the FBI chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election, the officials said. 
It is in line with policy though for Lynch to have met with Bill Clinton. 
But yes, a Hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate. 
Comeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter Friday anyway, shaking the presidential race 11 days before the election and nearly four months after the FBI chief said he wouldn't recommend criminal charges over the Democratic nominee's use of the server. 
The officials acknowledged there was little Lynch and Yates could do given the fallout over Lynch's controversial meeting over the summer with former President Bill Clinton. 
Note how the media is spinning this as Comey's drastic course of action while Lynch is just being a responsible public servant.

It's an obviously absurd move, but considering that the DOJ has become a transparently political organization that abuses and attacks law enforcement on a regular basis including, in the Eric Garner case, the FBI, this is just how things work in the hall of mirrors that the left has made . 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBI‚Äôs decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clinton‚Äôs emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. 
‚ÄúIt is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,‚Äù said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. ‚ÄúIt is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.‚Äù 
It's silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismiss.Except that bizarre and unlikely tactics, no longer are. There was outrage over MoveOn's attack on Petraeus and even most Dems thought that it was unhelpful. This attack on Comey I suspect will meet with little criticism. Some Dems will consider it a helpful preemptive move even though with his track record, Comey is as likely to hurt Hillary as he is himself.";english;2016-10-30T06:57:20.426+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Dems File Complaint w/DOJ Against FBI for Investigating Hillary;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/big-sister-600x337_1.jpg?itok=H4zDMDf0;0;1;0;0;0;hate

The ecoloons protesting the Dakota pipeline have the support of the media and the White House. But many of the local Sioux don't see them as defenders. They just wish they would go home . 
Ask around and you'll hear stories of pipeline protesters who've traveled great distances. They've come from Japan, Russia and Germany. Australia, Israel and Serbia. And, of course, there are the allies, not exclusively Native American or indigenous, who've flocked here from all corners of the US. 
Demonstrating is their proud daily work. 
The obnoxious leftists of the world have united. And they want no pipelines or showers. 
No one makes this clearer than Robert Fool Bear Sr., 54, district chairman of Cannon Ball. The town he runs, estimated population of 840, is just a few miles from the action. It's so close that, given the faceoffs with law enforcement, you have to pass through a police checkpoint to reach it. 
It's about time people heard from folks like him, he says. 
Fool Bear has had it with the protesters. He says that more than two years ago, when members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe could have attended hearings to make their concerns known, they didn't care. Now, suddenly, the crowds are out of control, and he fears it's just a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt. 
Go down to the camps, he says, and you won't see many Standing Rock Sioux. 
""It irks me. People are here from all over the world,"" he says. ""If they could come from other planets, I think they would."" 
And the Sioux are stuck helping leftist idiot protesters. 
Not long ago, he found three teenage girls from Ontario, Canada, camped out inside his storage shed. A white woman from Spokane, Washington, came to see him for help, saying she'd come here with nothing and her car had broken down. When he was at the casino recently, someone approached him about two young kids who were on their own because their parents had been arrested. 
Even though Fool Bear is against the protests, that doesn't mean he's not preparing to help people out, too. He anticipates opening the community gymnasium for people without beds come winter, and a growing pile of sleeping bags and blankets sits in his office. 
Those protesters from Arizona, Georgia and California won't know what hit them when the cold rushes in, he says. 
Instead of helping the Sioux, privileged leftists have become a burden for them to take care of.";english;2016-10-30T13:25:29.310+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Sioux Indians Wish Dakota Pipeline Protesters Would Go Home;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/mad_world_03_1.jpg?itok=5blYdC00;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Hillary Clinton called the FBI's actions ""deeply troubling."" They should be. For her. But instead the media made the propagandistic decision to upend the scandal coverage by portraying the FBI's actions in investigating Hillary as the scandal. Rather than Hillary's own actions.

This is some great investigative work. And it's the kind of story that flies under the radar and it's just a small component of the Democratic machine. But it is what the setup looks like . 
Jon Tester didn‚Äôt come all the way from Montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon. The US senator, virtually unknown in Boston, was in a conference room at the Thornton Law Firm that June morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the Democratic fund-raising circuit, a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians. 
Tester, a massive, jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm, was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests, all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys. But the drill was basically the same. The personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes, then returned to their offices. And Tester walked away with $26,400 in checks. 
But a striking thing happened the day Tester visited in 2010. Partner David C. Strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a ‚Äúbonus‚Äù that exactly equaled his $2,400 contribution to Tester‚Äôs campaign, the maximum allowed. A few days later, partner Garrett Bradley ‚Äî until recently the House assistant majority leader on Beacon Hill ‚Äî got a bonus, too, exactly matching his $2,400 gift to Tester. 
That's quite a coincidence. 
From 2010 through 2014, Strouss and Bradley, along with founding partner Michael Thornton and his wife, donated nearly $1.6 million to Democratic Party fund-raising committees and a parade of politicians ‚Äî from Senate minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Hawaii gubernatorial candidate David Ige to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Over the same span, the lawyers received $1.4 million listed as ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù in Thornton Law Firm records; more than 280 of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within 10 days. 
No corruption to see here. Now let's move on to another fake scandal. 
Thornton‚Äôs lawyers were especially generous to Vice President Joe Biden, one of Washington‚Äôs strongest advocates for trial lawyers, contributing more than $78,000 to his campaigns from 2003 to 2008. 
During President Obama and Biden‚Äôs reelection campaign in 2012, Michael Thornton hosted a fund-raiser for the Obama Victory Fund at his house in Cambridge, where Biden was the guest of honor. Some of the biggest donors ‚Äî some Thornton partners gave $20,000 ‚Äî were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with Biden, said someone who was there. Thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations.

If the Clinton campaign becomes any more deranged, Hillary will start running attack ads against the FBI. This kind of tactic is already perilously close to an attack ad. 
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign ratcheted up its attack on the director of the FBI on Sunday, circulating a draft letter critical of James Comey to former federal prosecutors. 
‚ÄúIt is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the United States Department of Justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by FBI Director James Comey to eight Congressional Committees,‚Äù the Clinton campaign‚Äôs letter speaking for prosecutors said. 
The letter was signed and provided to The Daily Beast by Elkan Abramowitz, a former chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. It is expected to be released Sunday evening. 
So we have the bizarre spectacle of Hillary deciding that she needs to campaign against the head of the FBI, who was just being praised for clearing her, because when you're a paranoid personality who assembles lists of enemies, this is how you react. But it's also telling that the Clinton campaign finds this so threatening that it is waging war on the FBI.";english;2016-10-31T05:57:53.998+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Hillary Campaign Launching Attacks on the FBI;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/hillary_clinton_1_2.jpg?itok=4ISnsqTA;0;1;0;0;0;hate

We now know that Lynch and Obama's DOJ are obstructing the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails. The biased media is predictably spinning this as the FBI being in the wrong and Hillary's backers at the DOJ being in the right. 
But it also appears that the DOJ was obstructing any investigations of Hillary. Including that of the Clinton Foundation. 
The FBI field office in New York had done the most work on the Clinton Foundation case and received help from the FBI field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said. 
In February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn‚Äôt go well. 
Some said that is because the FBI didn‚Äôt present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn‚Äôt a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case. 
‚ÄúThat was one of the weirdest meetings I‚Äôve ever been to,‚Äù one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Justice Department officials told the FBI at the meeting they wouldn‚Äôt authorize more aggressive investigative techniques, such as subpoenas, formal witness interviews, or grand-jury activity. But the FBI officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way, these people said. 
Of course the DOJ wouldn't authorize investigations of the Democratic Party's chosen.

That's quite an endorsement . And if there's anything top FBI officials now, it's crime families. Certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that Hillary can claim in any field.

‚ÄúKallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late '90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a ‚Äúpathological liar.‚Äù 
He also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs private server. 
‚ÄúThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I‚Äôm sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.‚Äù 
Kallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBI‚Äôs leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau.

October 31, 2016 
Originally published by the Gatestone Institute. Raymond Ibrahim is a Shillman Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. 
As the Muslim persecution of Christians continues to reach critical proportions around the world (see report below), the average American shows much more concern than the current administration. Soon after it was revealed that the Obama administration has taken in 5,435 Muslim refugees, but only 28 Christians‚Äîeven though Christians are approximately 10 percent of Syria‚Äôs population and are classified as experiencing a genocide there‚Äîa poll found that more than three quarters of American respondents agreed with the statement: ‚ÄúIt is important to me that the next US President be committed to addressing the persecution that some Christians face around the world (eg., imprisonment, beheadings, rape, loss of home and assets).‚Äù 
The deliberate targeting and killing of Christians in Europe also reached unprecedented levels in modern times. Most notably, on the morning of July 26, ‚Äú Allahu Akbar ‚Äù shouting Muslims stormed a small church in France during morning mass. They forced 85-year-old Fr. Jacques Hamel to his knees, slit his throat, and ‚Äú critically injured ‚Äù a nun, before being killed by police. (It was later revealed that police had known that church was being targeted and had even been monitoring one of the murderers for at least one-and-a-half years.) 
Later, when a journalist asked Pope Francis if Fr. Jacques was ‚Äú killed in the name of Islam ,‚Äù the pope disagreed. He argued that he hears of Christians committing violence every day in Italy: ‚Äúthis one who has murdered his girlfriend, another who has murdered the mother-in-law‚Ä¶ and these are baptized Catholics! There are violent Catholics! If I speak of Islamic violence, I must speak of Catholic violence.‚Äù The logic of the pope‚Äôs statement seems to be that violence done in direct contradiction of the Judeo-Christian God‚Äôs commandments‚Äîsuch as the murder of wives and mothers-in-law‚Äîis identical to violence done in accordance with Allah‚Äôs commandments to wage jihad on ‚Äúinfidels.‚Äù 
In ISIS-controlled territories in Iraq and Syria, reports of Christians being tortured to convert, maimed, crucified, burned alive, beheaded, or sold into sex slavery continued to emerge. In Iraq, a report says that ‚ÄúChristians and other minorities in Iraq are facing persecution at unprecedented levels and are at the verge of extinction ‚Ä¶. The Christian population has dwindled from 1.4 million to 300,000 in the last decade, according to some estimates. However, Minority Rights Group put that the number at anywhere between 50,000 to 250,000.‚Äù 
A former ISIS member exposed some of the atrocities the group commits in Syria. ‚ÄúThey were extremely brutal, killing women and the elderly who did not obey them. They abused and mutilated their dead bodies. They cut up the corpses, tied them to the back of the cars and dragged them along. They would find them and publicly execute them. I witnessed many executions.‚Äù 
The remainder of July‚Äôs roundup of Muslim persecution of Christians‚Äîmost of which was not committed by ISIS‚Äîincludes, but is not limited to, the following: Muslim Slaughter of Christians 
Nigeria : Two armed Muslim tribesmen murdered Rev. Joseph Kurah, an evangelical pastor, while he was working on his farm. They repeatedly hacked him to death with machetes. A local Muslim reportedly hired the assassins after he got into an argument with the Christian leader. Since 2001, Muslim Fulani have murdered thousands of Christians and destroyed hundreds of churches. According to a separate report , in just June and July, Muslim Fulani tribesmen targeted and invaded several Christian majority villages. They killed 133 people, destroyed 76 churches, and countless Christian properties and farms. Muslims hacked a female Christian preacher to death in the outskirts of Abuja. Eunice Elisha, a minister from the Redeemed Church of God, was found dead in a pool of her own blood after she went out to preach in the streets. A month earlier, on June 2, a Muslim mob beat Bridget Agbahime, the wife of a Christian pastor, to death with iron rods on the accusation that she blasphemed against Muhammad. About one million Christian children whose families have been displaced or affected by the violent activities of Boko Haram and Muslim Fulani herdsmen are starving. Churches, which are currently the primary supporters of these children, have gone beyond capacity and tens of thousands of children are expected to die of starvation and disease if they do not receive aid from elsewhere. According to the report, Boko Haram‚Äôs seven-year rebellion has left 20,000 people dead and more than two million displaced. 
Philippines : Attacks and murders of Christians around Mindanao Island, which has a large Muslim population, are on the rise. Fr. Sebastiano D'Ambra, who has lived in the region for 40 years, is calling on authorities to ‚Äúfind proper solutions‚Äù to stop ‚Äúthe agony of the Christian community.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúA Christian was killed in Jolo a few days ago. A reliable source told me that 20 Christians have been targeted to be killed or kidnapped soon‚Ä¶. the Christian community is suffering a form of persecution from those who are guided by bad elements who claim to do it in the name of Islam.‚Äù 
Kenya : Muslim gunmen from Al Shabaab murdered Pastor John as he was returning home from facilitating a peacemaking training seminar. The jihadis ambushed the bus he was in killing the pastor and six other people including children. 
Democratic Republic of Congo : Suspected Muslim militants armed with guns and machetes slaughtered nine Christians in the North Kivu region. They also looted homes, seizing food and cattle as plunder. The area, which is 96 percent Christian, has seen more than 1,100 killed over the last year and a half. 
Pakistan : The 2013 Muslim bombing of the All Saints Church in Peshawar, which killed more than 100 Christian worshippers, claimed its latest victim . After battling internal injuries she had received three years earlier from the attack, Cecilia, a 42-year-old Christian nurse, died from bomb fragments embedded in her body that had turned cancerous. According to the report, ‚ÄúWith tearstained eyes,‚Äù her husband noted that ‚ÄúWe are still losing loved ones [after the attack]. Forced Conversion, Rape and Murder of Christians 
Libya : A report documents the sufferings that Christians experience at the hands Muslim militants when they migrate through Libya in an effort to reach Europe. In one instance 11 women were abducted and kept as sex slaves underground and repeatedly raped by various jihadis for almost a year. One of the Christian women, Amal, 21, said: ‚ÄúThey took [the Christians] to Tripoli and kept us underground ‚Äì we didn't see the sun for nine months‚Ä¶. Sometimes we didn't eat for three days. Other times they would give us one meal a day, half a piece of bread.‚Äù The Christian woman described how they were pressured into converting to Islam under threat of death and beaten with hoses or sticks. ‚ÄúSometimes they would frighten us with their guns, or threaten to slaughter us with their knives.‚Äù 
Islamic State : ISIS has been making use of social media‚Äîincluding Facebook, and mobile apps like WhatAPP, and Telegram‚Äî to sell enslaved Christian and Yazidi girls to a wider network of sadists and pedophiles. One Telegram posting showed a picture of a young girl with the caption: ‚ÄúVirgin. Beautiful. 12 years old,‚Äù the posting states. ‚ÄúHer price has reached $12,500 and she will be sold soon.‚Äù 
Nigeria: Another report says that the Muslim terrorist group, Boko Haram, has murdered 466 people, almost all of whom were Christian, for refusing to convert to Islam; they also forced 218 women and young girls to ‚Äúmarry‚Äù their fighters. 
Pakistan : Muslims kidnapped and forced a 14-year-old Christian girl to convert to Islam last May. Her father pled with them for weeks to release his daughter. They eventually pretended to relent, told him to meet them somewhere so they could return his daughter, and, once he arrived, shot him dead . The girl remains with the rapists, the slain father‚Äôs widow and three other daughters are hiding in their home in fear of further reprisals from the kidnappers. According to Najma Bibi, the girl‚Äôs mother: ‚Äúseveral months after my daughter's kidnapping, the police have not done anything because we have no money to defend our rights. We live in a hopeless situation, we need help. I pray that my daughter will continue to place hope and faith in Jesus Christ.‚Äù Muhammad Iqrar, a Muslim man, assaulted and raped Sonia Nasar, a 16-year-old Christian girl. Although the rapist fled when her father rushed to the scene after hearing the cries of his daughter, Sonia was left in ‚Äúcritical condition.‚Äù He said that he expects no justice or follow up from local authorities, some of whom are associated with the rapist. Sobia Nadeem, a Christian girl studying for a Master‚Äôs degree in physics, was abducted by a group of Muslims, forced to convert to Islam, and forced to marry‚Äîat gunpoint‚Äîa man named Mohammad Hamza in Lahore. Although the girl managed to escape back to her parents‚Äô home, she was taken to court where her family had to prove that her conversion and marriage were performed under force. Numerous reports continued to appear indicating that non-Muslim students, most often Christians, are being forced to convert to Islam through the public school system. Teachers force them to recite the shahada‚Äîwhich when said before Muslim witnesses makes the reciter a Muslim‚Äîand force them to study Muslim beliefs and practices. This often occurs in conjunction with denigration of the Christian faith. Due to ongoing Christian protests, the Punjab government said it would launch an inquiry. Muslim Attacks on Christian Churches and Symbols 
Turkey : During the July 15 failed coup attempt, at least two churches were attacked . ‚ÄúOne of the attacks happened in Trabzon. A group of 10 people attacked Santa Maria Church with paving stones and hammers to smash the windows‚Äù said the report. One church leader in Istanbul said, ‚ÄúI'm not optimistic about the plight of Christians in Turkey. Bear in mind we've had a Roman Catholic Bishop murdered, we've had clergy threatened, we've had one priest murdered 10 years ago. Any Christian leader, if they're being honest, would say that some of what's going on is quite alarming.‚Äù 
Nigeria : On Friday, July 15, Muslims attacked a Catholic church. They were angered that Christians were praying in the church on Friday, Islam‚Äôs ‚Äúholy day,‚Äù when Muslims congregate and pray in mosques. According to a Christian church leader, ‚ÄúSometime around 2pm, some Muslim youths in their hundreds left their mosque after their Friday Jumat prayer and rushed to the church premises, climbed the wall and destroyed everything in the church: the windows, the altar, musical instruments, the chapel. The security man in the church premises was beaten to a pulp. Some women holding a prayer meeting were chased away. The seminarian, who is resident in the premises, was also beaten up and chased away.‚Äù 
Iraq : According to a new report , ‚ÄúAll 45 churches and monasteries inside Mosul are reportedly now occupied by ISIS, who have looted, burned and destroyed property, in addition to removing the building's crosses."" Christians unable to flee are forced to pay large extortion money (jizya) or risk instant execution. 
Sudan : A report notes that by continuously bombing Christian and non-Muslim indigenous regions near South Sudan, and targeting churches and pastors‚Äô homes for destruction, the government is trying to ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù the nation of Christians and create a homogenous Muslim state. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the violence, their homes, crops, churches, schools and hospitals destroyed. 
Indonesia : Despite receiving all legal documents and permits, a Catholic family trying to construct a shrine to the Virgin Mary on their own land since 2009 continued to face growing threats from local Muslims. In 2012, a Muslim mob set fire to the shrine site and brought construction to a halt. Most recently in July, Muslims stormed the house of a Catholic leader and ordered him to stop the work, even though he has a building permit issued by the authorities. Muslim Attacks on Christian Apostates, Blasphemers, and Preachers 
Egypt : According to a report , ‚ÄúJust like the biblical character Daniel in the lions' den, an Egyptian Muslim who converted to Christianity found himself at the mercy of ferocious attack dogs that were unleashed by his jailers to torture and possibly kill him. However, law student Majed El Shafie had God on his side and, just like in the story about Daniel, the savage animals miraculously did not harm him‚Äîto the utter astonishment of his prison guards.‚Äù He was, however, tortured by the Muslim guards themselves. 
Uganda : Another Muslim convert to Christianity has lost his family, home, and business, and now lives in a small shanty. As a result of his apostasy, the extended family of the 53-year-old man, a former Muslim imam, stormed and eventually appropriated his ancestral home in an attempt on his life. Of that night, he said: ‚ÄúI heard people talking outside my house around 8 p.m., saying that they wanted to take away my life and, ‚ÄòWe cannot watch the whole family turning to Christianity.‚Äô‚Äù He complained to the local council after his relatives also destroyed his business, but their intervention had no effect and he now lives without any means to provide for himself. 
Pakistan : Nadeem James, a 27-year-old Christian man and father of two, was arrested in Gujarat district after a Muslim angry with him accused James of texting a poem deemed ‚Äúblasphemous‚Äù of Muhammad. According to the accused‚Äôs brother: ‚ÄúWe were not at home when the police raided our house to arrest Nadeem. However, when the cops couldn‚Äôt find any of us in the premises, they took away two women of the family ‚Äì my wife and the wife of my elder brother, Faryad.‚Äù Around the same time, local mosques began calling on megaphones that if he didn‚Äôt surrender himself, Christian homes would burn. Nadeem surrendered himself and the women were released. ‚ÄúThe charge against my brother is completely baseless. Nadeem is uneducated and could not have possibly sent that text message. I‚Äôm certain that Yasir Bashir [Muslim accuser] downloaded the supposedly blasphemous text onto Nadeem‚Äôs phone and then forwarded it to his cell number to build a case against my brother.‚Äù Yaqoob Masih, 56, a Christian sanitary worker, was accused of committing blasphemy against Islam in Hyderabad. According to the report, ‚ÄúMasih collected waste from the streets and dumped it at a specific [location], however Bakash [Muslim accuser], without verifying, tortured Masih with a stick, accusing him [of] committing blasphemy by burning pages of a book which [reportedly] carried Islamic verses. Masih was packing the garbage and waste in a trunk when Bakash accused him [of] blasphemy.‚Äù Masih was hospitalized from his injuries. A Muslim doctor who treated a dying Christian man with medicine that was donated through zakat, Islamic charity, received death threats . The Christian was on the verge of dying without treatment. In his defense, the Muslim doctor said he did not know the man was a Christian, or that it was against some interpretations of Islamic law to use Muslim charity money to help non-Muslims. 
Iran : Three Azerbaijani pastors were arrested in Tehran during a visit. No reason was given to family and local legal experts. According to the report, ‚ÄúThis is the latest in a succession of pastors who have been imprisoned by Iranian authorities over many years for accusations ranging from apostasy to evangelism.‚Äù And Ebrahim Firouzi, who has been under arrest since 2013 under vague charges 
‚Äúsuffered physical abuse at the hands of prison guards when he was forced to attend an appeal hearing.‚Äù Dhimmitude: Muslim Contempt and Hostility for Christians 
Bangladesh : Christian and Hindu businesses received notices from a banned Islamic organization ordering them to uphold a number of Islamic customs or be killed. These include hanging banners with Allah‚Äôs name, keeping copies of the Koran, putting pictures of the Kaba in Mecca, removing pictures or statues of their own religions, creating a place for Muslims to pray, and banning music and female workers. 
Pakistan : The government in the Raiwind district flooded a Christian graveyard with sewage water and desecrated all the graves. In response, protesting Christians complained that even in the grave they can receive no peace in Pakistan. 
Sudan : Authorities insulted, forcefully arrested and jailed 14 Christians when they attempted to stop them from seizing an evangelical school on church property, which authorities plan on giving to Muslim businesses. Later, authorities returned to the same Christian school, gave letters of dismissal to the Christian headmistress, vandalized her office, and replaced her with a teacher of their own choosing. 
Egypt : After a Christian man was stabbed to death and many Christian homes and a church burned by angry Muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built, Coptic Christian Bishop Makarious of al-Minya was interviewed on television. Church authorities in Egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say, but Makarious made many revealing comments. Although only Christians, no Muslims, were killed and hurt, he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as ‚Äúclashes‚Äù‚Äîwhich suggests two quarrelling parties‚Äîwhen the reality is always that one side attacks the other: ‚ÄúWithin minutes [of the start of one of the attacks], 100 Muslims instantly appeared, fully armed, as if ready for war.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúAs long as the attackers are never punished, and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty, this will just encourage others to continue the attacks, since, even if they are arrested, they will be quickly released.‚Äù When the host asked questions about who is released and why, suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the Christians, the bishop replied: ‚ÄúWell what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested, with complete proofs and evidences against them, but then they are still declared innocent and released?‚Ä¶ this happens every single time.‚Äù About this Series 
The persecution of Christians in the Islamic world has become endemic. Accordingly, ‚ÄúMuslim Persecution of Christians‚Äù was developed to collate some‚Äîby no means all‚Äîof the instances of persecution that surface each month. It serves two purposes: 
1) To document that which the mainstream media does not: the habitual, if not chronic, persecution of Christians. 
2) To show that such persecution is not ‚Äúrandom,‚Äù but systematic and interrelated‚Äîthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by Islamic Sharia. 
Accordingly, whatever the anecdote of persecution, it typically fits under a specific theme, including hatred for churches and other Christian symbols; apostasy, blasphemy, and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who ‚Äúoffend‚Äù Islam; sexual abuse of Christian women; forced conversions to Islam; theft and plunder in lieu of jizya (financial tribute expected from non-Muslims); overall expectations for Christians to behave like cowed dhimmis , or third-class, ‚Äútolerated‚Äù citizens; and simple violence and murder. Sometimes it is a combination thereof. 
Because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities, languages, and locales‚Äîfrom Morocco in the West, to Indonesia in the East‚Äîit should be clear that one thing alone binds them: Islam‚Äîwhether the strict application of Islamic Sharia law, or the supremacist culture born of it.

Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. 
September 11, 2001 has come and gone. Countless bodies lie scattered in fragments around where two of the country‚Äôs tallest skyscrapers once stood. Some have burned to ash. Others had their throats slashed by Islamic terrorists. Still others fought and died on a plane to prevent another Islamic terror attack from taking place. 
But Joe has an idea. Joe is a guy with lots of big ideas and this one is a real doozy. 
The Senator from Delaware has come a long way since his days as a sixties shyster drumming up business in Wilmington. His formerly bald head is covered in hair so shiny is gleams under neon lights. His teeth are capped and shine almost as brightly. After a generation holding down a squeaky seat in the Senate, seniority makes him a man to be reckoned with. And therefore a man to be listened to. 
Even if you wish he would shut up. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm groping here,‚Äù Joe says. For once he isn‚Äôt referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs, massaging, squeezing, caressing. Instead he‚Äôs talking about foreign policy. The Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has no clue. 
Joe is worried that the Muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us. And he has a plan to make them feel better. 
‚ÄúSeems to me this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for $200 million to Iran,‚Äù Senator Joe Biden says. 
The remark isn‚Äôt quite as random as it seems. The Senator from Delaware, a state not known for its large Muslim or Iranian population, has a friendly relationship with the Iran Lobby. That relationship will only grow friendlier during the Bush era as he attacks America and appeases its enemies. 
Iranian-Americans who hate the Jihadist government that has taken over their country and oppressed the Persian people are outraged when he attends a fundraiser at a pro-Iranian lobbyist‚Äôs home in California while treasonously attacking his own government for naming Iran one of the members of the ‚ÄòAxis of Evil‚Äô. 
Joe‚Äôs usual Amtrak obsession wouldn‚Äôt get him in the door in California, but treason, hair plugs and capped teeth make him a big hit outside Delaware. And Joe remains very fond of Iran. 
He informs Israeli officials that ‚ÄúIsrael will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of Iran."" And that‚Äôs all the way back in ‚Äô08 before the deal that puts Iran on the path to a Shiite bomb was a nuclear twinkle in Obama‚Äôs eye and a radioactive itch in Hillary‚Äôs socks. 
That was a big year for Biden. It was his first and biggest shot at the big chair in the White House. Joe had tried it in ‚Äô88 and was stomped by Dukakis, of all people, after being caught plagiarizing a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock. ‚Äô08 got him a useless position in the White House as a consolation prize. 
This time around Joe Biden is expected to get the same consolation prize from Hillary Clinton that she got from Barack Obama; the office of Secretary of State of the United States. 
Of all the jobs that Joe Biden wants and is utterly unfit for, Amtrak train engineer, secret agent and the guy in charge of counting all the money at the bar, it‚Äôs hard to think of one that he‚Äôs less fit for. 
Joe Biden blamed Darfur on the Gingrich Revolution. He fell in love with the Taliban. 
""The Taliban per se is not our enemy,"" Joe insisted. ""There is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the Taliban is our enemy."" 
He suggested that 95% of the Taliban were probably okay and only 5% were ‚Äúincorrigible‚Äù. Most of the Taliban, he seemed to think, were, like Joe Biden, just in it for the money. 
But Joe Biden has a soft spot for Islamic terrorists whether they‚Äôre the Shiite Jihadists of Iran or the Sunni Jihadists of the Taliban. Joe loves all the terrorists of the world and the terrorists love him back. 
It wasn‚Äôt that long ago that we were being lectured to by the media on Bush‚Äôs ruination of relations with the rest of the world. If Biden were to become Secretary of State, he would become the third Democratic presidential campaign loser to get the job as a consolation prize for his failures as a politician. The last time a professional held down the job would have been the Bush administration. 
And yet, perversely, each ‚Äúloser‚Äù Secretary has been more incompetent than the last. Hillary‚Äôs disastrous time as Secretary of State could only be exceeded by John Kerry who gave away everything to the Russians and who was contradicted by the White House so many times it would have humiliated a lesser man. Or just any man. The only loser who could follow two class acts like that was Joe Biden. 
Joe Biden‚Äôs amateur diplomacy has been one disaster after another. Even his visit to Israel, a friendly ally not known for fractious political visits by American politicians, became an international incident with Biden sulking in his room while Hillary yelled at Prime Minister Netanyahu for 45 minutes over the phone. But somehow Biden, with his gift for appeasing Iran and the Taliban, alienates allies. 
Just this year, Joe Biden launched yet another attack on Israel. A cynic might almost think that Tehran Joe loves Islamic terrorists and hates those who resist them and fight against them. 
Biden has claimed that terrorism is not an existential threat. He accused President Bush of being ‚Äúshort-sighted‚Äù for using the military to fight Islamic terrorists. He argued that the perception that we want to stay in Iraq helps Al Qaeda. Some years later, his administration‚Äôs decision to pull out led to the rise of ISIS. He called for closing Gitmo while insisting that it had ‚Äúbecome the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world.‚Äù 
Senator Joe Biden was a voice for appeasement. Vice President Joe Biden was part of an administration that empowered and unleashed the malignant power of Islamic terror. Secretary of State Joe Biden would be able to act out his worst fantasies. He could even write that check to Iran. Though the Obama-Biden era has seen cash transfers to Iran that make Joe‚Äôs $200 million check seem like chump change. 
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs rise doesn‚Äôt just mean that she will be making big decisions. It will mean that Joe Biden will have gone from a Wilmington shyster to running the foreign policy of a country he has betrayed.";english;2016-10-31T11:51:32.426+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Meet Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Secretary of State;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sdf.jpg?itok=a_1pk7_P;0;1;0;0;0;hate

At home and abroad, a nation less affluent, less free, and far less secure. October 31, 2016 Lloyd Billingsley 
The President of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, used a pseudonym to communicate with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her private, unsecured email server. As Andrew McCarthy contended , that was the reason the FBI declined to prosecute Clinton, because the president would have been part of the same action, and that wouldn‚Äôt be politically correct. 
The current president of the United States is also on record that, contrary to custom, he will linger in Washington DC for a few years. Wherever he chooses to live, the email intrigue suggests continuing back-channel communications with Hillary Clinton, should she become president. That invites a look at what the man the New York Times dubbed ‚ÄúObama‚Äôs narrator,‚Äù the White House adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word, had to say about the president‚Äôs vision of the future. 
‚ÄúFew of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment,‚Äù David Axelrod explained in his massive 2015 Believer . ‚ÄúBut at home and abroad, Obama was playing a longer game.‚Äù As he explained in Columbia, Missouri, on October 30, 2008, ‚ÄúWe are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.‚Äù 
If this man was a liberal, as Barry Rubin wondered in Silent Revolution: How the Left Rose to Political Power and Cultural Dominance , why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal and Lyndon Johnson with his Great Society? He saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical. 
As David Horowitz explained in Volume 7 of the Black Book of the American Left , the president was ‚Äúborn, bred and trained in the progressive movement.‚Äù His mentors were ‚ÄúCommunists and their progressive successors,‚Äù so no wonder he presided over ‚Äúthe institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government‚Äù for eight years. What that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident. 
The economy remains sluggish and under Obamacare, the president‚Äôs signature plan, premiums are skyrocketing . This suggests that, as many believe, Obamacare was simply a demolition plan. In the ‚Äúlonger game,‚Äù designated successor Hillary Clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare, what some candidates erroneously call ‚Äúsocialized medicine.‚Äù 
As Rubin noted, the goal of the left is ‚Äúto convince Americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved: that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer.‚Äù The result ‚Äúmay be a very long-term and even permanent change of the United States into something else, a nation far less affluent and far less free.‚Äù And far less secure, as David Axelrod also indicates. 
Vladimir Putin makes an appearance in Believer but Obama‚Äôs narrator does not outline Putin‚Äôs background in the KGB. The believer includes nothing about Putin‚Äôs role in East Germany, a Stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape. The narrator avoids Putin‚Äôs belief that the breakup of the Soviet Union was ‚Äúthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.‚Äù 
In Believer , Putin tells the president, ‚ÄúYou are a highly educated man. I come from the security sector.‚Äù The believer then asks the president for his assessment of Putin. 
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs smart, tough, clear about his interests and without a trace of sentimentality,‚Äù the president says. That is not very strong language for a KGB veteran and expansionist autocrat.

October 31, 2016 Robert Spencer 
Sam Harris thinks it‚Äôs ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù that Maajid Nawaz and Ayaan Hirsi Ali made it to the Southern Poverty Law Center‚Äôs hit list of ‚ÄúAnti-Muslim Extremists.‚Äù He said nothing about me or the other people whom the SPLC included, which is not surprising, since he has quite recently expressed willingness to acquiesce in other contexts to the demonization that the SPLC list exemplifies. 
Hemant Mehta of The Friendly Atheist blog ably sums up the outrage over Nawaz and Hirsi Ali being included: ‚ÄúIf criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists, then it won‚Äôt be long before other vocal atheists end up on that list too. And make no mistake, that‚Äôs what Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are doing. That‚Äôs all they‚Äôre doing. They‚Äôre not anti-Muslim; they work with moderate Muslims. They‚Äôre critical of the worst aspects of Islam.‚Äù 
The problem with being angry about Nawaz and Hirsi Ali being on the SPLC list, but silent about everyone else who is on it, is that what Mehta says about Nawaz and Hirsi Ali can quite accurately said about everyone else on the list. If criticizing religious beliefs makes them ‚Äúextremists,‚Äù then it won‚Äôt be long before everyone who dares to utter a critical word about Islam will be on the list ‚Äî and that is indeed the objective of the list: to stigmatize and marginalize any and all such critics. Mehta protests that Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are ‚Äúnot anti-Muslim; they work with moderate Muslims. They‚Äôre critical of the worst aspects of Islam.‚Äù 
But no one would think that the other 13 were ‚Äúanti-Muslim‚Äù if it hadn‚Äôt been for the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Hamas-linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and their allied groups insisting that we were all these years, in their avidity to conflate opposition to jihad terror and Sharia oppression with hating a group of people ‚Äî a tactic designed to discredit opposition to jihad terror and Sharia oppression. Mehta and co. are falling for and validating the same smear tactics hey are decrying when used against their friends. 
And as for working with moderate Muslims, for 13 years Jihad Watch has contained this invitation : ‚ÄúAny Muslim who renounces violent jihad and dhimmitude is welcome to join in our anti-jihadist efforts.‚Äù It is Nawaz (as well as other moderates) who has attacked me, in what appears to have been a cynical attempt to gain support for himself among Muslims; I never attacked him, and would have have been happy to work with him otherwise. 
In complaining that Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are merely ‚Äúcriticizing religious beliefs‚Äù and are ‚Äúnot anti-Muslim,‚Äù Mehta is strongly implying that the others on the SPLC list are doing something beyond ‚Äúcriticizing religious beliefs‚Äù and are indeed ‚Äúanti-Muslim.‚Äù On Twitter the last couple of days I‚Äôve seen many people express outrage that Nawaz has been lumped in with the likes of Spencer; but when I ask them what the big difference is between us, or for quotes from me that are actually ‚Äúbigoted,‚Äù they go silent. 
Mehta, Harris, Haider and the others who are only angry with the SPLC‚Äôs hit list because it included Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are, by their selective outrage, acquiescing to and legitimizing the SPLC‚Äôs demonization of the other people on the list. (In his own defense, Hemant Mehta wrote me to explain, somewhat unsatisfactorily: ‚ÄúI focused on those two because they‚Äôre well known in atheist circles.‚Äù) This is a self-defeating choice for them to have made, for the SPLC has never identified anyone whom it considers to be a legitimate critic of Islam, and never will: the point of lists such as the one they released yesterday is to demonize and silence everyone who dares say something about Islam that is not warmly positive. 
The turn of Mehta, Harris, and Haider will come for the same treatment. One wonders if, when this happens, there will be anyone left to speak for them who has not already been smeared as ‚Äúanti-Muslim,‚Äù with their tacit approval.";english;2016-10-31T11:51:34.249+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Selective Outrage Over SPLC‚Äôs 'Anti-Muslim Extremist List';0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/mn.jpg?itok=VggFnaBh;0;1;0;0;0;hate

These past few days have seen a major shift in the Clinton tactics. During the original investigation, the Clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at Republicans for ""wasting time"" investigating Hillary, but did not attack the FBI. It misrepresented FBI statements, but it certainly did not target investigators in the way we're seeing now. 
But now we have open hostilities between Lynch at the DOJ and the FBI. We have the Clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the FBI. We have countless media hit pieces aimed at the FBI. 
The obvious question is why. The Clinton campaign kept its cool, at least to some degree, before. It certainly didn't begin an ill-advised campaign against the FBI. That's the kind of tactic that may play to your core base, but alienates everyone else. That is to say everyone who isn't in the media. 
So what's going on here? 
1. The Clintons thought they were done. It's close to the election. So they're lashing out. It's typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the Clintons. Hillary tried playing humble. She tried apologizing. But a moment ago, her victory seemed inevitable, and now she's in a state of fury at having it put at risk. 
2. There is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the Clinton campaign. Which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the FBI with both barrels. It's desperate to smear the FBI as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges. The attacks are a warning to treat Hillary with kid gloves again... or else. 
The first is plausible. To a degree. But for all of Hillary's awkwardness, she didn't lose it in the past. Why is she losing it now? There's no evidence beyond speculation for the latter. And yet the major shift in tactics is rather striking. If the Clinton campaign were panicking, this is what it would look like.";english;2016-10-31T14:57:59.335+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Is Hillary Panicking Over the FBI and Weiner Emails?;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/bagdad-bob_2.gif?itok=xOeoGjV6;0;1;0;0;0;hate

We've recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the ""Trump is Doomed"" polling saga. A few days ago, the media was loudly trumpeting that Hillary's victory was inevitable, that the polls were in and she was going to ignore Trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races. And then, just like last time around, the numbers turned around again. 
I was recently asked to predict the race. I answered that the one thing I could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for Hillary right before the election. That much is very likely. 
It's in the media's interest to spread FUD by promoting polls that predict not just a Hillary win, but a landslide, creating the perception that voting is useless. The more Republicans feel that the outcome is futile, the less likely they will be to go out and vote. But the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding. This remains a challenging and very unusual election. 
The premature panic we've seen in some circles is unhealthy. We shouldn't completely ignore poll numbers, but neither should we treat them as inevitable.

We're not talking about Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the ex-muppet in charge of the DNC who was forced to resign because of the way the DNC rigged the process to favor Hillary. This is Donna Brazile who was brought in to replace her to bring back integrity to the DNC. Since Brazile is another Clinton loyalist, that was never going to happen. 
But the latest leak reveals that Brazile had passed along a second debate question to Hillary. All this just emphasizes how fraudulent and rigged the whole debate process was. 
Another leaked email has emerged showing Democratic National Committee boss and former CNN contributor Donna Brazile sharing a debate question in advance with the Hillary Clinton campaign -- despite Brazile's persistent claims to the contrary. 
CNN announced in a statement soon after the email became public Monday that Brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it on Oct. 14, days after the controversy over Brazile tipping off the Clinton campaign initially broke. 
According to documents released Monday by WikiLeaks, Brazile sent Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri an email titled, ‚ÄúOne of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash,‚Äù the night before the March 6 CNN primary debate in Flint, Mich. 
‚ÄúHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,‚Äù Brazile wrote. 
The following night, Lee-Anne Walters, a mom whose twin boys stopped growing and whose daughter lost her hair during the Flint water contamination crisis, posed a question to both Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee, and her primary opponent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
Clinton responded with a lengthy answer that moderator Anderson Cooper had to twice interrupt in an attempt to keep to the agreed-upon time limit.

Independents are the largest political group in the country. Larger than either Democrats or Republicans. And they're tilting toward Trump and the GOP. 
Adding in ideology, the tracking poll shows Clinton going from 95 percent support among liberal Democrats early in the tracking poll to 88 percent now, while Trump's gone from 89 percent among conservative Republicans to 94 percent now. 
Independents -‚Äì sometimes swing voters in past elections, albeit inconsistently ‚Äì- also merit attention. They've gone from a scant 6 points in Clinton's favor in the first four nights of tracking, 44-38 percent, to a substantial Trump lead now, 34-51 percent, Clinton-Trump. 
A key element here is the partisan preferences of independents who emerge as likely to vote: They were 2 points more likely to lean toward the Republican Party rather than the Democratic Party at the start of tracking, but are 10 points more apt to do so now. 
Hillary Clinton tried to win over independents by positioning her brand as a moderate centrist who can work with Republicans and can get things done while portraying Trump as dangerous and irresponsible. It certainly worked to a degree.

The Hillary Clinton whineaton continues. 
After having mobilized mulltiple ex-officials and media types to attack the FBI, the Clinton campaign, whose candidate blatantly benefited from white glove from the FBI is complaining about a double standard. 
Hillary Clinton's campaign accused FBI Director James Comey Monday of engaging in a ""blatant double standard."" 
Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook slammed Comey in the wake of reports that the FBI director refused to publicly comment on potential Donald Trump campaign ties to Russia's alleged efforts to meddle with the U.S. election, but did weigh in on an updated investigation involving Clinton's email server. 
""It is impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard,"" Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said on a call with reporters. ""That Director Comey would show more discretion in a matter concerning a foreign state action than one involving the Democratic nominee for president is nothing short of jaw-dropping."" 
Yes, it's jaw dropping that Mook can't grasp how investigations work. 
Comey had no reason to comment on the Trump thing because it wasn't part of an existing criminal investigation of Trump. There has been, despite Hillary's bottomless barrel of lies, a criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton. 
It's a double standard if Trump and Clinton were both facing criminal investigations. It's not a double standard since only Hillary is.";english;2016-11-01T06:27:23.010+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Hillary Clinton Campaign Still Whining About the FBI;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/user812517_pic124606_1438224400.jpg?itok=QpaJjlyy;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. 
The chorus of NeverTrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and Hillary‚Äôs supposed victory approach. After more than a year of complaining about Trump crashing their political soiree, the Republicans attacking Trump still don‚Äôt seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are out-of-touch elites disdainful of the Republican masses. 
A recent example comes from premier NeverTrumper Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal . In his column Stephens bids farewell to a Republican Party stupid enough to nominate Trump, contrasting it with his imagined Golden Age of Republican policy excellence that Trump and his followers have destroyed. One policy in particular, immigration, reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make Trump the nominee: 
At a 1980 Republican primary debate in Houston, candidates George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free. Mr. Bush said they should. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, family-loving people that are in violation of the law,‚Äù he lamented. 
Reagan agreed. Instead of ‚Äúputting up a fence,‚Äù he asked, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we . . . make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit, and then, while they‚Äôre working and earning here, they pay taxes here.‚Äù For good measure, Reagan suggested we should ‚Äúopen the border both ways.‚Äù 
Where, in the populist fervor to build a wall with Mexico and deport millions of human beings, is that Republican Party today? 
Take Bush senior‚Äôs statement first. It repeats basically the same clich√©s that the bipartisan Gang of Eight recycled in 2013 during their push for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, another euphemism for amnesty. All those hard-working, family-values illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives, we were told, who just need legal status and social recognition so they can ‚Äúcome out of the shadows,‚Äù as John McCain said, and start voting Republican. The political apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree: son Jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an ‚Äúact of love.‚Äù 
This stance on illegal immigration by Republican politicos and pundits is obviously light-years from the experience and position of many ordinary people. Take McCain‚Äôs oft-repeated trope of ‚Äúliving in the shadows.‚Äù Seriously? Illegal alien young people openly protest on live television, knowing they are not going to be deported. Millions visit emergency rooms for free, and wrangle food stamps, welfare transfers, school lunches, and all sorts of largess, all the while they live protected by ‚Äúsanctuary cities.‚Äù And ‚Äúliving in the shadows‚Äù doesn‚Äôt deter them from committing felonies, given that even if caught, convicted, and deported, they‚Äôll soon be back. Remember Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, the illegal alien deported five times, who murdered Kate Steinle? Or Angel Gilberto Garcia-Avalos, another five-time deportee who just this month started a $61 million fire in Sequoia National Park? He had just been released from the Kern County Jail, but could not be deported because of California‚Äôs lunatic sanctuary city law, which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents. 
Simply repeating the ‚Äúhard-working, family values, religious‚Äù mantra doesn‚Äôt address the problems of illegal immigration. There are such illegal immigrants, as I know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country. I grew up with Mexican-Americans, they‚Äôre members of my immediate family, they‚Äôre my friends, students, and colleagues. They‚Äôre also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border. 
Some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants, but many do not. A rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff. But Bush, McCain, and Stephens have not proposed a workable, rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go. That means with any form of amnesty, citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately, with only the most egregious felons sifted out, if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to ‚Äúlive in the shadows.‚Äù But all those guilty of DUIs, hit-and-runs, or defrauding the welfare system with fake IDs will stay‚Äì‚Äìand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act, which enshrined ‚Äúfamily reunification,‚Äù with no limits on relatives of U.S. citizens. 
Equally tone-deaf is Stephens‚Äôs bringing up Ronald Reagan‚Äôs ‚Äúopen the border both ways.‚Äù That‚Äôs exactly what he did in 1986 when he signed the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, with promises of ‚Äúborder enforcement‚Äù that never materialized. Stephens doesn‚Äôt mention that as a result, the number of illegal immigrants increased from about 3 million to 11 million, creating today‚Äôs crisis. The obvious lesson is secure the border first, then figure out what to do with the 11 million. It would be governmental malfeasance to repeat Reagan‚Äôs mistake. 
The problem with politicians and pundits like Stephens is they don‚Äôt live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores. People like Stephens don‚Äôt live daily with the disorder and crime that results. They‚Äôre not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life, the illegal immigration version of ‚Äúbroken windows,‚Äù such as dogs without rabies shots running free, health and safety codes ignored, building codes shrugged off, garbage and refuse dumped everywhere, copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights, and chronic petty theft‚Äì‚Äìand that‚Äôs on top of stolen cars, hit-and-runs, driving without insurance, gang-banging, and dealing drugs. 
And if Mr. Stephens thinks I‚Äôm just a nativist or xenophobe or racist, I dare him to visit the San Joaquin Valley. Better yet, let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month. Come and tour a hospital emergency room, a Social Security disability office, a public school, a county jail, and then wax lyrical about these ‚Äúhonorable, decent, family-loving people.‚Äù It would take just a week for Mr. Stephens to develop a ‚Äúfervor‚Äù for a five-foot high wall around his house, and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun. Then again, he wouldn‚Äôt last that long. Within a day he‚Äôd scurry back to his nice, white, secure tony neighborhood where he doesn‚Äôt have to pay the cost of his moral preening. 
And that hypocrisy is where Trump came from. In the perception of millions of voters‚Äì‚Äìperceptions NeverTrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like reality‚Äì‚Äìthe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their party‚Äôs voters. And so they would rather see a venal, perjurious, corrupt mediocrity become Obama 2.0 and continue the progressive destruction of the Constitutional order, than see elected the nominee of their own party.

Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. 
A generation ago the Communist tyranny in Cuba demanded that the United Nations condemn America for the embargo. The brutal Castro regime‚Äôs rant accused the United States of threatening ‚Äúnuclear annihilation,‚Äù ‚Äúcountless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders.‚Äù 
On a cold day in October, the European left-wing activist serving as UN Ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the US at the UN. 
""UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain,"" Samantha Power said. 
""Thank you,"" she added, acknowledging the applause. 
Under Obama, the United States would no longer defend the United States. A generation ago the Communists had been in Cuba. Now they were in Washington D.C. 
Instead of defending America, Obama‚Äôs chosen representative agreed that our Communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy. 
‚ÄúLet me be among the first to acknowledge ‚Äì as our Cuban counterparts often point out ‚Äì that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust,‚Äù she said. 
If the Cuban representative had been in her place, he could not have done much better. Communist Cuban propaganda was now being parroted by Ambassador Power. If the Castro dictatorship wanted to save money, it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to Washington D.C. 
The Cuban ambassador boasted that Cuban Communists had ‚Äúrid ourselves of US imperialism‚Äù and proclaimed that, ‚ÄúWe will never go back to capitalism.‚Äù He declared that the resolution was a powerful message to ‚Äúthe peoples of the world.‚Äù The message is indeed unmistakable. 
Ben Rhodes, the close Obama adviser who sold the media on the Iran sellout, curtly tweeted his justification, ‚ÄúNo reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose.‚Äù 
Who is this ‚Äúwe‚Äù? 
The Cuban embargo is the ‚Äúlaw of the land‚Äù. It‚Äôs the official policy of the United States. It‚Äôs based on laws passed by Congress and implemented by President John F. Kennedy and his successors. 
This ‚Äúwe‚Äù certainly isn‚Äôt the United States government, its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one. 
One member of the ‚Äúwe‚Äù must be Ben Rhodes because he tells us so. Who is Rhodes? An ‚Äúaspiring‚Äù novelist who pushed Obama to back the Muslim Brotherhood takeover of Egypt, the Iran nuke sellout and now, apparently, choosing Communist Cuba over America. 
No one has ever elected Rhodes to anything, but under left-wing rule, he outweighs Congress, President Kennedy, the law of the land and the national interests of the United States. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äù is Obama who made the final decision. It‚Äôs Ambassador Samantha Power. It‚Äôs a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government. This is the ‚Äúwe‚Äù that announced its treasonous opposition to the US at the UN. 
America has a ‚Äúwe‚Äù problem. 
If the ‚Äúwe‚Äù of the American left wants to vote its own way, it should secede to form its own country. 
When President John F. Kennedy proclaimed the ‚ÄúEmbargo on All Trade with Cuba‚Äù, he based it on authorization from ‚Äúthe Congress of the United States‚Äù. That is how our system used to work. 
These days El Teleprompte in D.C. decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with Iran, mandate transgender bathrooms, legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in Havana and he does so on his own authority. And Congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists. 
That‚Äôs not how America is supposed to work. That‚Äôs how Iran works. That‚Äôs how Cuba works. 
The first word in the introduction to Obama‚Äôs Presidential Policy Directive on Cuba after the date was ‚ÄúI‚Äù. Obama‚Äôs basis for his authority is his 2014 announcement. L'etat c'est moi. Obama is the State. 
JFK, no humble shrinking violet, mentions ‚ÄúI‚Äù only in the fourth paragraph, after Congress. What is the context of Kennedy‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äù? ‚ÄúNow, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority of section 620(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.‚Äù 
The ‚ÄúI‚Äù of JFK can only act as a servant, not a master. 
In Obama‚Äôs ‚ÄúDirective‚Äù, Congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism. There is no source of authorization for anything other than Barack Obama. There is no law. Only Obama. 
Now the big ‚Äúwe‚Äù in Washington have decided that they will oppose America at the United Nations. But Ben Rhodes, who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives, made an unfortunate slip. Obama has been accused of Louis XIV‚Äôs L'etat c'est moi mentality. But Ben Rhodes isn‚Äôt saying, ‚ÄúWe are the state‚Äù. Instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in America. One is US. The other is We. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äù does not yet entirely control the state. But ‚Äúwe‚Äù also feels no obligation to the United States. If ‚Äúwe‚Äù agrees with America, then ‚Äúwe‚Äù will vote with it at the UN. If ‚Äúwe‚Äù opposes America, then ‚Äúwe‚Äù votes against it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests. Not ours. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äù happens to run America. But it isn‚Äôt America. It‚Äôs the parasite humped on America‚Äôs back. 
You can call ‚Äúwe‚Äù by many names. Deep State is one. It‚Äôs a coalition of left-wing special interests networking through politics, the non-profit sector and media corporations to control America. 
President Kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy . ‚ÄúWe are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice.‚Äù 
Kennedy was speaking after the recent Bay of Pigs crisis. The Foreign Assistance Act, mentioned by him, was passed by Congress that year. While the Cuban embargo limited the ability of the Castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world, it didn‚Äôt stop the ‚Äúwe‚Äù in Washington D.C. 
It is easy to sit here in the distant future of 2016 and wonder whether Cuba matters at all. But the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the Cold War. That struggle did not end when the Berlin Wall fell. It is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù or by the nameless ‚ÄúWe‚Äù of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the Nomenklatura of the left. 
By backing away from America at the United Nations, the ‚Äúwe‚Äù have announced their independence from the laws, responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked. 
But the ‚Äúwe‚Äù offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule. Instead they impose on us the collectivism of Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel ‚ÄúWe‚Äù in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the One State that controls every aspect of human life. That novel inspired 1984. 
What ‚Äúwe‚Äù offer us is what Cuba‚Äôs Castro, We‚Äôs One State and every Communist regime offer us. It's what George Orwell in 1984 summed up as, ‚ÄúA boot stamping on a human face ‚Äî forever.‚Äù 
President Kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the ‚Äúone hundred and eighty-sixth‚Äù year of ‚Äúthe Independence of the United States of America.‚Äù At the United Nations, Ambassador Power cheerfully declared America‚Äôs enforced submission to the Communist demands for Cuba. 
The Cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their Communist overlords. The question is will the United States of America be able to regain its independence from the ‚Äúwe‚Äù?";english;2016-11-01T07:32:54.859+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Obama Won‚Äôt Vote With America at the UN;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/sw_1.jpg?itok=tQeKjW6k;0;1;0;0;0;hate

The war on law enforcement is epidemic. Every aspect of culture has been infected. The anti-police disease is highly contagious and rapidly spreading on social media, in memes, in movements, in popular fast food restaurants, at football games, on campuses, in media and in every aspect of American culture. 
An epidemic is defined as the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. Colin Kaepernick is the Typhoid Mary of the anti-police epidemic. Kaepernick refuses to stand while the U.S. national anthem is being performed at the start of NFL games as a protest against alleged racial injustice and police brutality. On Sept. 1 Kaepernick chose to kneel on one knee as his protest gesture instead of just sitting on the bench. His explanation for his decision to switch is that it was an attempt to show more respect to former and current U.S. military members. As if kneeling is somehow symbolically less offensive than sitting. He misinterpreted the meaning of the military expression, ‚Äòtake a knee‚Äô which occurs when troops take a pause before continuing their mission. Similar to ‚ÄòHands Up Don‚Äôt Shoot‚Äô the anti-police gesture has been imbued with a trendy righteousness regardless of its original meaning. The media reverently refers to Kaepernick‚Äôs protest as ‚ÄòTaking a Knee‚Äô as if it is some kind of sacred act. There are no headlines that read ‚ÄòKaepernick Disses the Flag‚Äô or ‚ÄòKaepernick Takes a Crap on his Country‚Äô. Just in case his gesture didn‚Äôt send a clear enough message, Kaepernick also uses clothing to symbolize his anti-police sympathies. He has worn everything from t-shirts honoring the militant Black Panther Party to socks that depict police as pigs. In addition to numerous other crimes the Black Panther Party was responsible for the murder of at least 15 officers and originated the expression ‚ÄòOff the Pigs‚Äô meaning murder police. 
Like the typhoid infected cook Mary Mallon, Kaepernick is rapidly spreading the anti-police pathogen. In what has been dubbed the ‚ÄòKaepernick Effect‚Äô dozens of NFL and WNBA players have knelt, sat, or raised a fist during the national anthem. The disease has also spread to over 50 high schools, 35 colleges, and one middle school. In what can only be described as a bizarre symbolic contradiction there were two incidents where women performing the Star Spangled Banner got down on one knee in protest of what they were singing. One of the women, Denasia Lawrence, not only kneeled while performing the anthem but also opened her jacket to display a Black Lives Matter t-shirt exposing Miami Heat fans to the contagious disorder. 
Rapid spread is well known for infectious diseases. The anti-police disorder also contaminated the Navy. An unidentified sailor assigned to the Naval Air Technical Training Center in Pensacola, Florida, filmed herself deliberately not standing for the National Anthem and posted it on Facebook. She remained seated and raised a fist during morning colors and then praised Colin Kaepernick. Another sailor Petty Officer 2nd Class Janaye Ervin, an intelligence specialist in the Navy Reserve, stationed at Pearl Harbor, did not stand for the national anthem while in uniform. She also posted a statement on Facebook saying she was inspired by Colin Kaepernick. The Navy acted decisively. She lost her security clearance and may be facing jail in response to her actions. It is yet to be known if facing real consequences will contribute to curing the virus or accelerating it. 
Kaepernick is just one carrier of the anti-police disease. The source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as Black Lives Matter that originated in Florida during the Trayvon Martin protests. The disease went airborne in Ferguson, Missouri where it was transmitted to college students, professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country. Currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda. The symptoms are irrationality, excessive anger, impaired perception, anxiety, hatred and delusions of oppression. Acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior, aggression, paranoia, loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies. All indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order. 
Early symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers. Anti-police graffiti is a common symptom of the virus. Writing has escalated from insults such as ‚Äòpolice are murderers‚Äô to threats of violence. A recent popular indicator is the expression ‚ÄòKill Cops‚Äô and related variations such as ‚ÄòKill All Police‚Äô, ‚ÄòSave A Life, Kill a Cop‚Äô, ‚ÄòCops Lives Don‚Äôt Matter‚Äô and ‚ÄòShoot Cops‚Äô. Threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers‚Äô heads. Violent anti-police rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read ‚ÄòAll My Heroes Kill Cops‚Äô, ‚ÄòPut Wings on Pigs‚Äô [Kill Cops] and ‚ÄòCops Under Control Or Cops Under Flowers‚Äô. Disturbingly, anti-police graffiti, protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified. 
The anti-police epidemic has also spread to well-known fast food restaurants. Employees have refused to serve officers at a Taco Bell in Phenix City, AL; Dunkin Donuts in West Hartford, CT; Krispy Kreme in Columbia, SC; IHOP in Virginia Beach, VA; Arby's in Pembroke Pines, FL; Chuck E. Cheese in Bowling Green, KY; Whataburger in Lewisville, TX; McDonalds in Brenham, TX; Chipotle in Brooklyn, NY; Genghis Grill in Dallas, TX; Noodles & Company, in Alexandria, VA; Tropical Smoothie in Winter Haven, FL; Lucky‚Äôs Teriyaki, Sedro-Woolley, WA and at the Krystal Restaurant in Irondale, AL. Other incidents involved employees refusing to let an officer use the restroom in a Philadelphia Starbucks, refusing service at a Sunoco gas station in Miramar, FL, writing Black Lives Matter on an officer‚Äôs coffee cup at a Dunkin Donuts in Providence, RI and a Walmart Bakery in McDonough, GA refusing to bake a cake for a police officer‚Äôs retirement party. These are just the incidents that have been made public. 
Refusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect. Law Enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with. For this reason, many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made. This is a legitimate concern. On Aug 23, 2016 in Louisville, KY five police officers were denied service at a Taco Bell. When another employee took their orders, they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying, ‚ÄúI'm going to mess with them,‚Äù which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant. When officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a full-scale epidemic. 
The anti-police infection went viral on social media. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social networks have hundreds of anti-police pages ridiculing, disrespecting and threatening officers. Protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers. The following are examples of popular hashtags: #FTP (Fuck The Police), #BlueLivesMurder, #ACAB (All Cops Are Bastards), #BlueLivesDontMatter, #FuckCops, #FuckThemAll, #APDK (All Police Dept. Killer), #FryEmLikeBacon, #BlackLivesMatter, #Ferguson, #MilwaukeeUprising and #Kaepernick. 
As the disease progresses, more acute symptoms begin to manifest in acts of violence. A particularly offensive indicator of the disorder is the desecration of fallen officer memorials. Memorials honoring officers killed in the line of duty have been attacked in Philadelphia, Chicago, Albuquerque, Fresno, Denver, New Orleans, Oakland, Austin, Honolulu, Rochester, San Diego, St. Paul, Covington, Richmond, Goshen, Fayetteville, Raleigh and many other cities across the country. Vandalism has involved everything from dousing in paint, toppling and scratching granite, burning, to destroying a metal torch in order to extinguish the eternal flame. In a previous article , I described these acts as symbolic assassinations. Vandals target tributes to heroic officers because they want to appropriate the valor, honor and respect that they think they have been deprived of. This is another symptom of the anti-police disease. A sense of entitlement and resentment that leads to both symbolic and actual attacks on law enforcement officers. 
At its most critical stage the anti-police disorder is lethal. This is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers. In the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident. A pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence. Consequently, Kaepernick‚Äôs gesture is neither benign nor harmless. It is one symptom in a deadly epidemic.";english;2016-11-01T07:32:55.132+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;The Anti-Police Epidemic;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/generic-night-police-lights.jpg?itok=RF7ewDdP;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Note: In what follows, Shillman Fellow Raymond Ibrahim reviews Force and Fanaticism: Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia and Beyond, by Simon Ross Valentine. A shorter version of the book review first appeared in the Middle East Quarterly (Fall, 2016, vol. 23, no. 4). 
Valentine, a British Methodist pastor and teacher who taught in Saudi Arabia, has written a useful book about the desert kingdom. Most interesting is its exploration of how the monarchy is ""the single greatest force in spreading Islamic fundamentalism""; it ""has spent as much as $100 billion to spread Wahhabism in the West,"" yet ""America and Britain have been, and are continuing to be, implicit supporters of Wahhabism."" 
Valentine discusses the background of how this ""unholy alliance"" came about. He warns: ""If the West simply ignores it, Saudi Arabia's role in international terrorism seems likely to worsen rather than conveniently disappear."" This is troubling considering that ""ISIS is Saudi Arabia's latest monstrous contribution to world history."" 
The author explores important topics, including the mutawwa , or religious police, and provides useful historical context, discussing the origins of ‚ÄúWahhabism,‚Äù its alliance with the House of Saud, and the oil discoveries that changed everything. 
The book‚Äôs primary defect is standard. Valentine regularly insists that ‚Äúit is of the greatest importance to distinguish between Wahhabism and Islam generally.‚Äù Anything good, positive, tolerant and peaceful is ascribed to Islam; anything bad, negative, intolerant, and violent‚Äîmisogyny, draconian punishments, execution of apostates, intolerance for and discrimination against non-Muslims‚Äîis ascribed to ‚ÄúWahhabism.‚Äù 
This position appears to be based on the author‚Äôs own cultural presuppositions. Thus he ‚Äúfelt confused and puzzled‚Äù to hear of Wahhabi intolerance, including the ‚Äúattempt to propagate their beliefs by force,‚Äù prompting him to wonder: Can you force someone to love God?....

The political left keeps announcing, as if it is a new breakthrough discovery of theirs, that life is unfair. 
Have they never read Thomas Gray's ""Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,"" more than two and a half centuries ago? What about economic historian David S. Landes' statement: ""The world has never been a level playing field""? 
In the joint autobiography of Milton Friedman and his wife Rose, they say: ""Everywhere in the world there are gross inequities of income and wealth. They offend most of us. Few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by others."" 
Moreover, Professor Friedman left behind a foundation dedicated to promoting school choice, so that disadvantaged children could get a better education for a better chance in life. 
What is it that the political left is saying that they think is so new, such a breakthrough and such a necessity for progress? More important, what test of evidence ‚Äî if any ‚Äî have they ever subjected their notions to? 
No one has presented the social vision of the left more often than Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times ‚Äî and no one has been more certain that those who do not happen to share his vision ""just don't get it,"" as he has repeatedly declared. 
Mr. Kristof's essay ""Growing Up Poor in America"" in the October 30th New York Times is a classic example of the mindset of the left. 
It begins with the story of a poor black teenager in Arkansas, being raised by a single mom. Sometimes he goes hungry and his home does not have even one book. But it does have television sets with huge screens, and apparently there is money enough to buy marijuana. 
Surely we can all agree that this young fellow has very unpromising future prospects ahead of him, and that this is a human tragedy. The circumstances of his life are unfair to him and none of us would want to be born into such circumstances. Moreover, he is just one of many who are brought up in a setting that is full of dangers and with a low probability of improvement. 
But that is not enough for Mr. Kristof or for the political left in general. Of such youngsters he says, ""as a society, we fail them long before they fail us."" 
Whoa! Just when did ""society"" make the decisions and engage in the actions that have led to this teenager being in the bad situation he is in? And just when did ""society"" acquire either the omniscience or the omnipotence to prevent it? 
When the left says ""society"" they usually mean government. That is apparently what ""society"" means in this case, for Kristof laments that this teenager is ""the kind of person whom America's presidential candidates just don't talk about."" 
If the left chooses to believe that government intervention is the answer to such tragedies, that is their right. But, if they expect the rest of us to share that belief, surely they could subject that belief to some empirical test. But we can, however. 
The 1960s were the triumphant decade of those who wanted government intervention to ""solve"" what they called ""social problems."" How did that work out? What were things like before this social vision triumphed? And what were things like afterwards? 
Homicide victimization rates among black males were going down substantially in the 1940s and the 1950s. But homicide victimization rates reversed and skyrocketed in the 1960s, wiping out all the progress of the two previous decades. 
When the 1960s began, most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father. After the great welfare state expansion during the 1960s, most black children were born to a single mother, like the youngster in Arkansas today. 
Kristof's essay also mentions a teenage girl who is a single mother, and suggests that ""sex education"" could have prevented her from getting pregnant. Teenage pregnancy was going down ‚Äî repeat, DOWN ‚Äî during the 1950s. It reversed and shot up after the 1960s began bringing the ""sex education"" vision into schools across the country. 
Very similar trends occurred in England, after very similar visions and policies also triumphed there in the 1960s. Perhaps it is the left that just doesn't get it ‚Äî or cannot face the hard fact that its own vision and policies worsened the very things they claimed would be made better.";english;2016-11-01T07:32:55.748+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;The Left's Vision;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/ap_967030594535-e1456947216338-936x625.jpg?itok=cku4Kfnm;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Good morning. It's Tuesday. 
Who's up for another silly attempt to claim that Hillary Clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because she's a woman? This gem comes from Robin Lakoff, a Berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading. 
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Emailgate Is an Attack on Women 
'It's not about emails; it's about public communication by a woman‚Äô 
I am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It‚Äôs us. 
The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? 
His name was General Petraeus. Thank you. Have a nice day. 
Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she‚Äôs doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. 
That escalated quickly. And incoherently. Also I'm pretty sure it's not the 20s or whatever decade Robin is parodying or channeling. But yes, Hillary Clinton is only in this mess because she's a woman. It has nothing to do with anything else. That must be why Albright and Rice weren't in the center of similar scandals. 
If the candidate were male, there would be no scolding and no ‚Äúscandal.‚Äù Those very ideas would be absurd. Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech. In theory, so do women, but that, as the creationists like to say, is only a theory. 
Emailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech. It's illegal for both public officials of both genders. 
But here‚Äôs Hillary Rodham Clinton, the very public stand-in for all bossy, uppity and ambitious women. Here are her emails. And since it‚Äôs a woman, doing what decent women should never do‚Äîengaging in high-level public communication‚Äîwell, there must be something wrong with that, even if we can‚Äôt quite find that something.

Clintonworld is a giant sewer. Nothing about it can surprise. It plummets to infinite depths of slime, mold and rotting carrion. This is just another day in Clintonworld . 
John Podesta, who draws no salary from the campaign, is making $7,000 per month from the Sandler Foundation, run by Herb Sandler, Politico reported. 
The Sandlers ran World Savings Bank, which was sold to Wachovia in 2006 for $25.5 billion and which was accused of offering adjustable-rate mortgages that contributed to the housing collapse. 
Saturday Night Live got into trouble when it depicted the Sandlers as people who should be shot. Time Magazine listed them as one of 25 people to blame for the financial crisis. 
In the early 1980s, the Sandlers' World Savings Bank became the first to sell a tricky home loan called the option ARM. And they pushed the mortgage, which offered several ways to back-load your loan and thereby reduce your early payments, with increasing zeal and misleading advertisements over the next two decades. The couple pocketed $2.3 billion when they sold their bank to Wachovia in 2006. But losses on World Savings' loan portfolio led to the implosion of Wachovia, which was sold under duress late last year to Wells Fargo. 
Notorious right wing comedy show Saturday Night Live also featured the Sandlers 
On October 4, 2008, however, Saturday Night Live aired a skit in which the Sandlers were depicted as predatory lenders. Under their names, SNL placed the caption ‚Äúpeople who should be shot.‚Äù Compounding the Sandlers‚Äô negative press was a Time magazine list that identified them as two of the ‚Äú25 people to blame for the financial crisis.‚Äù The New York Times also labeled the Sandlers ‚Äúpariahs‚Äù -- and on December 24, 2008, the Times reportedthat their mortgages were the ‚ÄúTyphoid Mary‚Äù of the housing crisis. On February 15, 2009, CBS‚Äôs 60 minutes also aired a segment that featured the Sandlers‚Äô World Savings Bank as one of the primary examples of how the mortgage industry had destroyed itself and unleashed an economic collapse.‚Äã

Peter Kadzik kept Hillary's campaign chief out of jail. And he hopes to do the same for her. 
Hillary's people have gone on the warpath against the FBI. Their allies are Obama's political appointees at the DOJ. And this is who is in their corner. 
The Justice Department official in charge of informing Congress about the newly reactivated Hillary Clinton email probe is a political appointee and former private-practice lawyer who kept Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta ‚Äúout of jail,‚Äù lobbied for a tax cheat later pardoned by President Bill Clinton and led the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. 
Peter Kadzik, who was confirmed as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in June 2014, represented Podesta in 1998 when independent counsel Kenneth Starr was investigating Podesta for his possible role in helping ex-Bill Clinton intern and mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. 
‚ÄúFantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,‚Äù Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta‚Äôs Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. 
Kadzik‚Äôs name has surfaced multiple times in regard to the FBI‚Äôs investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for using a private, homebrewed server. After FBI Director James Comey informed Congress on Thursday the FBI was reviving its inquiry when new evidence linked to a separate investigation was discovered, congressional leaders wrote to the Department of Justice seeking more information. Kadzik replied. 
‚ÄúWe assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,‚Äù Kadzik wrote on Oct. 31. 
Kadzik had been an attorney with Dickstein Shapiro LLP for 18 years before he represented Podesta in the Clinton/Lewinsky investigation. He was hired in 2000 as a lobbyist for tax cheat Marc Rich, who was controversially granted a pardon by President Bill Clinton during Clinton‚Äôs final days in office. Kadzik got the job ‚Äúbecause he was ‚Äòtrusted by [White House Chief of Staff John] Podesta,‚Äô and was considered to be a ‚Äòuseful person to convey [Marc Rich‚Äôs] arguments to Mr. Podesta,‚Äô‚Äù according to a 2002 House Oversight Committee report. 
Marc Rich? Funny you should mention his name. FBI boss Comey was the prosecutor in that case. And the FBI recently released material from the investigation into that case.

The FBI has an early present for Hillary Clinton. It's the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash. That fugitive was a fellow by the name of Marc Rich. His prosecutor? James Comey. 
The FBI unexpectedly released 129 pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in 2005 into President Bill Clinton‚Äôs pardon of Marc Rich, who had been married to a wealthy Democratic donor. 
The unusual timing of the release was the result of a Freedom of Information Act request that had been completed and was posted under standard FBI practice, according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. But the Clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release. 
Well of course it did. It's never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you. 
The investigation stemmed from one of several pardons Clinton made on the last day of his presidency in 2001, that of financier and international fugitive Marc Rich, whose ex-wife Denise had given to the Democratic National Committee and the entity that would later become the Clinton Foundation. 
And there's a surprise guest. 
While the files may seem dated, they invoke figures beyond the Clintons who went on to play key roles in official Washington -- including Comey. 
He served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against Rich from 1987 to 1993. As the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2002, Comey took over a criminal investigation of Clinton‚Äôs pardons. ‚ÄúI was stunned‚Äù at the Rich pardon, Comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in 2008. 
Clinton's people are fuming, but it was a standard FIOA request and there's nothing big here. It's just one of those things the Clintons should have gone to jail for. But didn't.

‚ÄúPresidential debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton included a third participant: Vladimir Putin, standing in the background, stealthily inserting himself in the process.‚Äù Putin‚Äôs Russia ‚Äúuses deniable cyber-hooliganism to actively prank the American political system. And it‚Äôs taking a toll. . . This is the Putin Playbook. Steal, cheat, attack, disrupt, mislead, confuse. If caught, lie and deny.‚Äù And it gets worse. 
‚ÄúUnfortunately, the Republican presidential nominee reinforces this narrative, referring to a ‚Äòrigged‚Äô system and an indictable opponent. His outbursts follow years of domestic political discord, where comity is history, crazy seems the new normal, and a sitting president can be heckled with ‚ÄòYou lie!‚Äô‚Äù 
All told, the piece reads like a Clinton press release, but it‚Äôs actually ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs powerful playbook: Hack, steal, disrupt, mislead, confuse,‚Äù in the October 30, Sacramento Bee , two days after the Comey email bombshell. The author is Markos Kounalakis, billed as ‚Äúa senior fellow at Central European University and visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt quite capture the man and his connections with the Clintons, which have shown up in Wikileaks. 
Mr. Kounalakis‚Äô author line fails to reveal that he is married to Eleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis, daughter of real-estate tycoon Angelo Tsakopoulos. According to Greek USA Reporter , Angelo is a ‚Äútop political donor to the Clintons as well as the Democratic Party,‚Äù whose ‚Äúdonations to former President Bill Clinton were rewarded with a night in the prestigious Lincoln Bedroom.‚Äù In 2013 Tsakopoulos, ‚Äúconfirmed that Hillary Clinton will seek the Democratic nomination in the next Presidential election.‚Äù 
Angelo‚Äôs daughter Eleni, a prot√©g√© of Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Boxer , raised more than $1 million for Hillary Clinton in 2008 , and that money found its reward. On January 7, 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton swore in Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary. In that capacity , she condemned Wikileaks for releasing secret diplomatic cables, but declined comment on the authenticity of the material. Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis served as ambassador until 2013 but as Wikileaks confirms, she continued as a key Clinton supporter doing her best to beat back a presidential run by Joe Biden. 
In a June 11, 2015 email, Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis tells John Podesta that a Bay Area bagman ‚Äúswears Biden is running. He said he took him on Air Force Two, and he‚Äôs getting emails.‚Äù Last July, Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis emailed Clinton confidant Jake Sullivan that ‚ÄúHRC indicated her view that it would be best to avoid Grexit‚Äù and a July 9, 2015 email to Sullivan, John Podesta and Huma Abedin, she supports ‚Äúterms that will allow Greece to stay in the Eurozone.‚Äù 
On October 11, 2015, Tsakopoulos Kounalakis emailed Podesta that ‚Äúthere is a Greek American love fest going on with Joe Biden, very boy-club.‚Äù The same day she emailed Podesta and Huma Abedin that ‚Äúwe had a David Brock dinner with Annie Karni from Politico. She asked to use four quotes from me (see attached). I told her the first two could be with attribution, and the second two without.‚Äù 
As the emails to John Podesta and Humba Abedin reveal, ‚ÄúAmbassador Eleni Kounalakis,‚Äù as she styles herself, remains part of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs inner circle. Tellingly, the McClatchy-Tribune newspapers that run her husband‚Äôs columns, do not acknowledge the strong Clinton connection. 
The New York Times proclaimed Kounalakis a ‚ÄúWhite Knight‚Äù for rescuing Washington Monthly , where he served as publisher and teamed with editor Paul Glastris. This tandem made the publication a ‚Äúprogressive must-read,‚Äù according to Clinton strategist James Carville. Kounalakis reported for Newsweek in East Germany and ran their bureau in Prague. He also worked in Moscow for NBC Radio and Mutual news. 
Kounalakis‚Äô books include Hope Is a Tattered Flag: Voices for the Post-Bush Era , with Peter Laufer, and Beyond Spin: the Power of Strategic Corporate Journalism with Drew Banks and Kim Daus. It remains something of a mystery how the leftist Kounalakis became a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, known for strong conservative writers and scholars such as Thomas Sowell, Victor Davis Hanson, and Bruce Thornton. 
Only one time, as this writer recalls, has Kounalakis acknowledged in print his wife‚Äôs strong Clinton connections. Even after the Wikileaks revelations, and with a presidential election only days away, Kounalakis did not acknowledge his wife‚Äôs key role in HRC‚Äôs inner circle with John Podesta and Huma Abedin. His October 30 Sacramento Bee piece suggests Markos is right at home in those circles. 
Kounalakis attacks ‚Äúthe Republican presidential nominee,‚Äù implying that he is ‚Äúcrazy,‚Äù and a tool of the evil Putin. On the other hand, the Clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy: ‚ÄúAmerican society has made great strides in LGBTQ rights, women‚Äôs rights and minority rights, and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy.‚Äù 
The author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure Clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged Clinton crony. Maybe Markos will join his wife, Huma Abedin, and John Podesta in the Wikileaks revelations. For many observers, the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic. If Markos Kounalakis believes they are bogus, maybe he can write about what‚Äôs in the real ones.";english;2016-11-02T06:45:42.828+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;HillaryMediaMole.Con;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/markos_kounalakis.jpg?itok=8xI-KGTW;0;1;0;0;0;hate

November 2, 2016 Ari Lieberman 
Most of us, including several democratic lawmakers, cringed when Obama inked the Iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the Iranian regime, recoiled in horror when we learned that Obama transferred $400 million to the Iranians in exchange for four American citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges. The $400 million was part of a larger installment totaling $1.7 billion, ostensibly to settle claims Iran had against the United States stemming from aborted Iranian arms purchases dating back to the Shah. Obama claimed that this was money that was ‚Äúowed‚Äù to Iran and the settlement, which included $1.3 billion in interest, saved the U.S. taxpayer ‚Äúbillions‚Äù because the Iranians were demanding even more at the Hague tribunal, where the claim was being adjudicated. 
The timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geo-political concerns. The Americans were freed only after Iran received its $400 million. The payment, which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane, was made in untraceable cash, stacked on wooden pallets. The Iranians demanded Swiss Francs and Euros rather than Dollars and a pliant Obama agreed to the Islamic Republic‚Äôs dictates. Gleeful Iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom, contradicting the administration‚Äôs adamant denials. 
Even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom. State Department spokesman Mark Toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the $400 million was used as ‚Äúleverage‚Äù to ensure the Americans‚Äô safe return. The White House however, quickly repudiated the State Department‚Äôs characterization. 
Even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration, the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the U.S. to extortion and hostage-taking. The Iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not, every two-bit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well. 
But there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story. In his January 17, 2016 address to the American people, Obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the Islamic Republic but as noted by Rick Richman in an excellent article featured in Mosaic , the deal struck with the Iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the American people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement. 
The $400 million that the U.S. transferred to Iran came from Iran‚Äôs Foreign Military Sales (FMS) account with the Pentagon. The balance of 1.3 billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since 1979. But Obama neglected to note that when Iran filed its lawsuit, the U.S. filed counterclaim against Iran for $817 million for Iranian breaches of its obligations under the FMS program. The U.S. could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the American treasury, courtesy of the Islamic Republic. 
Moreover, American plaintiffs maintained sixteen U.S. court judgments against the Islamic Republic stemming from that regime‚Äôs involvement in terrorist activities. Those judgments totaled $3.9 billion in compensatory and punitive damages. 
Some plaintiffs sought to recover their Judgments directly from Iran‚Äôs FMS account but their efforts were stymied by the Clinton administration. Instead, under a convoluted deal struck between Congress and the Clinton administration in 2,000, the U.S. treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against Iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and 10 percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the FMS fund. The judgments would then be subrogated to the United States, which meant that judgments became direct U.S claims against the Iranian government. 
Iran ignored the Judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs. Under U.S. law, the $400 million sitting in the FMS account should have gone back to the U.S. treasury, which had already paid the judgment holders. But the U.S. treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since Obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to Iran. Essentially, the U.S. taxpayer ended up footing the bill for Iran‚Äôs terrorism while the Iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence. 
Obama‚Äôs actions represented blatant disregard for the law, for the victims of terrorism and for the American taxpayer. His claim of saving the taxpayer ‚Äúbillions‚Äù represents the zenith of mendacity. 
Obama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures. But as noted by Richman, the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle Iranian claims instituted at The Hague, exposing yet another lie by the Obama administration. 
There was one, and only one reason why the Iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is. The Iranians are the world‚Äôs foremost state-sponsors of international terrorism. They finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing. Hence, they demanded untraceable cash. The misery that we are currently witnessing in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the Obama administration which provided the Iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing. 
In addition to the $1.7 billion in cash, Obama also authorized the release of seven convicted Iranian felons and expunged warrants on 14 others. But this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal. 
Lastly, the transfer of such a large sum to Iran in ‚Äúsettlement‚Äù of an alleged legal claim required the attorney general‚Äôs approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing Loretta Lynch‚Äôs signature authorizing such payment. On October 7, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) presented Lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal. Lynch, whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor, has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers‚Äô queries. 
In a desperate attempt to establish a legacy, Obama pursued the Iran deal with reckless abandon, forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in U.S. diplomatic history. The ancillary deal struck with the Iranians concerning American hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the Iranians to continue their reign or regional terror.

Originally published by the Jerusalem Post . 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs upcoming trips to Australia, Singapore, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan might be the most significant diplomatic visits he makes in his tenure in office. The trips will take place against the backdrop of two major international shifts that cast Israel into uncharted waters as a small state with a dizzying array of strategic threats arrayed against it. The states that he will visit are all well-positioned to help Israel navigate its next moves. The first shift is the US‚Äôs political crackup. 
Next week American voters will choose their next president. The major candidates, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, are the weakest candidates to have ever stood for the highest office in the land. Their rise is a testament to the weakening, if not the unraveling of the glue that has held America together since the Civil War. The unraveling of the US electorate comes against the backdrop of the diminution of US military power. The US‚Äôs multi-trillion dollar investment in inconclusive if not failed wars in the Middle East over the past 15 years has come at the expense of military modernization. The F-35 program has sucked up the majority of the remaining research and development funds. And it has yet to produce a reliable airplane. Worse, the F-35‚Äôs long and problematic gestation period has given Russia and China the time and opportunity to develop air defense systems capable of neutralizing the F-35‚Äôs stealth systems. Those systems were supposed to be its chief advantage as the next generation fighter for the US and its allies. The deterioration of the US‚Äôs military capabilities has gone hand in hand with the US‚Äôs apparent loss of strategic rationality. This is apparent worldwide, but is nowhere more obvious than in the Middle East. President Barack Obama‚Äôs decision to effectively abandon the US‚Äôs major allies in the Middle East in favor of cultivating ties with Iran has made the region far more dangerous to the US and its spurned allies than it was eight years ago. True, in theory, Obama‚Äôs decision to prefer the Shi‚Äôites to the Sunnis makes sense given the totalitarian and imperial nature of Sunni jihadism. But in light of the genocidal, totalitarian and imperial nature of the current Iranian regime, his move made no sense and its impact has been massively destructive. Moreover, Obama‚Äôs willingness to rack up the US‚Äôs national debt in an unprecedented manner and repress economic growth through overregulation has left a large question mark over the possibility of a military buildup. In other words, even under the best circumstances, it is hard to imagine that the US will be capable of reestablishing its global primacy over the next four years or even over the next decade. The implications for Israel are far reaching. For decades, Israel‚Äôs strategic posture has been predicated on its ability to depend on US power. This strategic posture is no longer tenable. The second major international shift is Russia‚Äôs sudden rise as the primary global power in the Middle East. As Channel 2 reported Sunday night, Russia has deployed sophisticated naval and air systems in the region that can detect all of Israel‚Äôs air and naval operations. In a matter of months, Israel has lost the air and naval supremacy it has enjoyed for the past four decades. The air force reportedly is convinced that the F-35‚Äôs stealth systems will be able to neutralize Russia‚Äôs detection capabilities. But given the well-documented current problems with the F-35‚Äôs stealth systems, this conviction is unwise. And even under the best circumstances, in which Israel has the opportunity to develop its own electronic warfare systems and apply them to its F-35 without American interference, it will take Israel years to surmount the challenge that rapidly improving Russian systems present to our air force. According to Channel 2‚Äôs report, air force and naval commanders are in a panic over the sudden turn of events. Rather than panicking though, Israel needs to roll with the punches and figure out how best to cope with this new situation. The obvious answer is that we need to quickly expand our capabilities in areas that Russia‚Äôs military primacy does not reach. Specifically, Israel needs to expand massively its capacity for under-the-radar operations. The first area that needs to be massively strengthened is our intelligence capabilities, particularly human intelligence capabilities. Israel should be investing massively in developing and expanding our cultivation and direction of proxies on the ground throughout the region. Second, Israel needs to adapt its cyber technology capabilities in a manner that diminishes our enemies‚Äô ability to strike us. Israel needs to be able to disrupt and disable command and control and other systems. Israel‚Äôs reach needs to extend as low down the line of its enemies‚Äô military chain of command as possible. If our offensive capabilities are being checked, so must the capabilities of our enemies. Indeed, our enemies need to be subverted. Part of the intelligence and cyber capabilities that Israel must develop and deploy must be geared toward destabilizing with the goal of overthrowing the regime in Iran. At the same time, Israel should be empowering anti-regime sectors in Iran in a manner that expands the prospect of developing close ties with a successor regime along the lines of the strategic alliance Israel built with the regime of the shah in the decades which preceded the 1979 Islamic revolution. Third, Israel needs to expand and diversify the capabilities of our ground forces. Israel needs to be capable of using new means to deploy its fighters at home and on distant shores. It needs to align its both its special and regular forces with the new threat environment. And it needs to be able to utilize its ground forces in manners that can extend the reach and diminish the compromised positions of its air and naval assets in the era of Russian regional primacy. Fourth, Israel needs to expand its economic growth and diversify its economic ties in a manner that positions it as a regional economic power. It needs to use it natural gas resources specifically as a means to expand and deepen its ties with Asia. Such economic growth and power will positively influence Russia‚Äôs willingness to allow Israel to carry out air and naval operations against its enemies ‚Äì and Russia‚Äôs allies in Lebanon, Syria and beyond. In other words, the more economically powerful Israel is, the more Russia will be willing to side with Israel against Hezbollah and others that are currently operating under the Russian umbrella. This then brings us to Netanyahu‚Äôs upcoming trips. Each state that he will visit has something to offer Israel in expanding its intelligence, cyberwarfare and economic capabilities. Australia, a major Western economy, is moving toward China as America has become less engaged in the Pacific. Israel has an acute interest in using Australia as a platform for expanding its ties to China and other Asian countries, both because of the economic advantages such ties convey and due to China‚Äôs strategic importance to Russia. As for Singapore, Israel effectively built the Singaporean military in the 1960s and 1970s. The country remains extremely supportive of Israel. Like Australia, Singapore has close ties to China. It has technological and other capabilities that can be extremely advantageous for Israel today. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are critically important to Israel today. Their strategic proximity to Iran, and their ties to Russia, along with their ethnic composition and their natural resources make securing good relations with both critical to Israel‚Äôs ability to advance and security its strategic interests in every sphere. Israel has tremendous assets to offer each of the four countries that Netanyahu will visit. These assets must be deployed wisely to ensure that Israel gains as much as possible from his trip and from its future ties with all of them. Given the dramatic changes in the global power balance, and their implications for Israel, Netanyahu‚Äôs decision to fly to visit these four countries just after the US elections tells us that he gets it. At a time of regional and global turbulence and uncertainty, in the context of swiftly multiplying threats, this is no small matter.";english;2016-11-02T06:45:43.651+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Netanyahu‚Äôs Critical Foreign Tour;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/defense.gov_photo_essay_110325-d-xh843-010.jpg?itok=B0EiswGj;0;1;0;0;0;hate

November 2, 2016 
Originally written for the Investigative Project on Terrorism. 
Israeli human rights group B‚ÄôTselem recently appeared before a special session of the United Nations Security Council, excoriating Israel and pleading with the body to act against Israel‚Äôs settlements. 
In 1975, the UN famously declared that ‚ÄúZionism is racism‚Äù and, four decades later, the organization continues to hound Israel. In each of the last four years, as the Syrian bloodbath claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, there were at least five times as many resolutions condemning Israel as those rebuking the rest of the world. 
The UN‚Äôs cultural body, UNESCO, recently passed a motion ignoring any Jewish (or Christian) historical ties to East Jerusalem holy sites, referring to the Temple Mount and Western Wall only by their Muslim names and condemning Israel as ‚Äúthe occupying power.‚Äù It turns out that some of Israel‚Äôs left-wing NGOs worked to help produce the UNESCO motion. 
Given the UN‚Äôs chronic hostility, efforts by Israeli NGOs to persuade the UN to act against Israel are arguably treasonous. Indeed, one attorney and activist for Israel‚Äôs left-leaning Labor party filed a police complaint alleging treason against B‚ÄôTselem, arguing that the NGO has harmed state sovereignty, tried to give land away to a foreign entity, and taken steps that could cause a war. 
Israeli democracy is extremely tolerant, to the point of allowing its members of parliament to openly support terrorism and terrorist groups. Last March, several Israeli Arab Knesset members condemned Arab states for labeling Hizballah a terrorist organization, even though it has been at war with Israel for decades and regularly threatens new hostilities. 
Last February, members from the Joint (Arab) List paid a solidarity visit to relatives of Palestinian terrorists whom Israeli security forces had killed to stop them from murdering Israelis. In 2014, MK Hanin Zoabi (Balad) drew praise from Hamas after she asserted that the kidnappers of three missing Israeli youths were ‚Äúnot terrorists.‚Äù Hamas‚Äôs connection to the young men‚Äôs abduction and murder helped to spark the third war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. 
Thus, Israel already has plenty of dissenting voices and activists without foreign intervention. Nevertheless, foreign interests have identified Israeli NGOs as the soft underbelly of Israeli democracy and have leveraged them to promote their own agendas. The problem became so acute that a watchdog, NGO Monitor, was formed in 2002 to track the self-hostility being funded largely by European and other foreign sources. As the organization notes: ‚ÄúNGOs lack a system of checks and balances, and‚Ä¶provide accountability to their funders and activist members, and not to the citizens or societies whose lives are directly impacted by their activities.‚Äù 
NGO Monitor also notes that, even though most of the foreign government funding for these Israeli NGOs is ‚Äúformally designated for ‚Äòeducating the Israeli public‚Äô and ‚Äòchanging public opinion‚Äô (both in violation of the norms on non-interference in other democracies), these Israeli NGOs are very active externally, in the delegitmization and political warfare against Israel.‚Äù 
These left-wing Israeli NGO‚Äôs receive money from about two dozen foreign governments , and some private organizations . That includes millions of dollars from billionaire George Soros. 
In Catch the Jew , author Tuvia Tenenbom exposed how foreign-funded ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù and ‚Äúcultural‚Äù organizations in Israel tend to serve as vehicles for attacking Israel. By presenting himself to interview subjects as ‚ÄúTobi the German,‚Äù Tenenbom elicits some surprising confessions. For example, the New Fund for Cinema and TV, a foreign-funded Israeli cultural NGO, told him that that about 80 percent of political documentaries made in Israel are co-produced by Europeans. That includes a documentary called ‚Äú10%‚ÄîWhat Makes a Hero,‚Äù which equates Israel‚Äôs military with the Nazis. Such films would be too scandalous to be produced in Germany, but German-sponsored NGOs can safely pay left-wing Israelis to make such movies. 
Some foreign funders of Israeli NGOs have even unwittingly enriched Hamas. Last August, Hamas allegedly siphoned off ‚Äútens of millions of dollars‚Äù from World Vision, a U.S.-based charity, and used the funds for weapons purchases, tunnel construction, and other military activities. 
The Knesset passed a law in July requiring disclosure of foreign funding sources for NGOs that get more than half of their money from overseas. The law is ‚Äúclearly aligned with the American Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA),‚Äù wrote legal scholar Eugene Kontorovich, who defended the legislation in response to critics. 
‚ÄúIsrael is unique in the sheer scale of the foreign government sponsorship of domestic political groups,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúFor example, the European Union alone has in recent years given roughly 1.2 million Euro a year for political NGOs in the US and roughly an order of magnitude more in Israel‚Äîa vastly larger per capita amount.‚Äù 
The Obama administration opposes foreign influence only when that influence promotes a dissenting view. Obama opposed Netanyahu‚Äôs speech to the U.S. Congress against the Iranian nuclear deal, but was happy to give a speech to the UK parliament against Brexit. The Obama administration critiqued Israel‚Äôs NGO-funding-disclosure law , perhaps because it had sent U.S. taxpayer money to an Israeli NGO working to oust Israel‚Äôs prime minister. 
The same hypocrisy seems to prevail among Israel‚Äôs foreign-funded NGOs. They ostensibly exist to promote democracy and peaceful co-existence, but are conspicuously silent when Palestinian institutions violate those ideals. Such silence enables abuse by Palestinians and promotes a distorted and incomplete picture of the complex reality in which Israelis operate. Foreign-funded Israeli NGOs remained silent after the Palestinian Authority arrested Palestinians who visited a Sukkah in a symbolic peace event promoting coexistence. 
‚ÄúThese organizations are silent when the Palestinian leadership pays salaries to the families of terrorists, glorifies murderers and calls streets and city centers after them,‚Äù Netanyahu said. ‚ÄúThese organizations prove again and again that they are not actually interested in human rights, but only in shaming Israel and libeling it around the world.‚Äù 
If Israel‚Äôs left-wing NGOs truly are committed to democracy and peace, why haven‚Äôt they condemned the PA‚Äôs efforts to prevent ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù with Israel? In 2014, Jibril Rajoub, the deputy secretary of the Fatah Central Committee and the head of the Palestinian Supreme Council for Sport and Youth Affairs, condemned a coexistence-promoting soccer match between Israeli and Palestinian youths on a southern kibbutz, as ‚Äúa crime against humanity.‚Äù 
Last week, a Palestinian newspaper came under intense criticism for publishing an interview with Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman. The Jerusalem-based newspaper Al-Quds was denounced by Hamas , the Palestinian Journalists‚Äô Syndicate, and the supposedly ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù PA. The ‚Äúchilling effects‚Äù and anti-peace message implicit in the harsh reactions to the interview have yet to catch the attention of any left-wing NGOs supposedly working for peace and democracy.";english;2016-11-02T06:45:44.129+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;The Hostility and Hypocrisy of Left-Wing Israeli NGOs;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/ml.jpg?itok=eHPuoFNa;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Black voters helped Hillary beat Bernie, but they're not turning out for her in early voting . Neither are millennials. 
After Sunday night‚Äôs polls closed, black vot ers accounted for 16 percent of the in-person early vote ballots cast. And that included five previous days of in-person early voting. 
But in 2012, in just two days of in-person early voting, blacks cast 25 percent of those early ballots, according to Dan Smith, a University of Florida political science professor who published some of the early voting data on his must-read Election Smith blog. 
Due to such strong African-American turnout after the beginning of in-person early voting in 2012, Democrats began outpacing Republicans in total ballots cast before Election Day, by about 10,000. This year, though, Republicans still cling to their own lead of about 9,000. As of Monday morning about 3.7 million absentee and in-person early ballots had been cast, 40.5 percent of them by Republicans and 40.2 percent by Democrats. 
Hillary is getting Latino support, largely due to the immigration debate, but she just doesn't have the hot sauce draw that her husband and Obama did. That leaves her more dependent on white voters and forces her to zigzag between moderate and extreme positions.

It's midnight in America. And the Clintons and the Democratic Party keep finding ways to cover themselves in glory. I'm sure the line on this will be that the FBI is acting ""inappropriately"" by investigating this. Investigating political corrupt ion interferes with corrupt politicians being elected. 
The FBI is investigating an alleged illegal donation scheme involving a wealthy Saudi family that supports Democratic Florida Senate candidate Patrick Murphy. 
Murphy, who has covered himself in glory so often already, is denying everything. And I mean absolutely everything. 
The Murphy campaign declined to say whether the candidate is aware of the FBI probe 
What's your name? I decline to answer that question. 
Murphy, 33, is running against Rubio, the incumbent Republican, in a race that could help decide which party controls the Senate in 2017. Rubio currently leads Murphy by an average of 5.6 percentage points, according to RealClearPolitics. 
The FBI investigation, however, relates to Murphy‚Äôs first run for the House in the 2012 campaign cycle. 
The allegation ‚Äî originally submitted by a Republican super PAC run by a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ‚Äî is that Murphy‚Äôs high school friend and major political donor, Ibrahim Al-Rashid, coordinated a ‚Äústraw donor‚Äù scheme to boost Murphy. 
Murphy knows nothing! 
Murphy‚Äôs campaign declined to say whether Murphy‚Äôs attorneys had discussed the FBI investigation with Al-Rashid‚Äôs attorney. 
Uh-huh 
Al-Rashid is the son of a powerful and politically connected Saudi billionaire. He‚Äôs been a major financial benefactor of Murphy‚Äôs, giving almost $400,000 to his campaigns and to outside groups supporting the Florida congressman. 
Here's how some of these donations worked. 
One example within the alleged scheme: A woman who describes herself in federal donation reports as the ‚Äúowner‚Äù and ‚Äúproperty manager‚Äù of a Texas-based company, Limestone Property Management, gave Murphy‚Äôs campaign $300. 
But she is neither the property manager nor the owner of the Texas-based company. In fact, she doesn‚Äôt work there. 
She lived in Miami at the time and was Ibrahim Al-Rashid‚Äôs ‚Äúcleaning lady,‚Äù according to a Miami-Dade Police Department report filed in 2012 over a home burglary at Al-Rashid‚Äôs property. 
Texas property manager vs Saudi's cleaning lady. That's quite a difference. 
Murphy has been forced to return Al-Rashid's donations before for purely Islamophobic reasons. 
Al-Rashid‚Äôs three sons have followed in their father‚Äôs political footsteps, contributing large sums to top Democrats, including Rep. Patrick Murphy (D., Fla.), whose Senate race could help decide which party controls the Senate in 2017. 
Murphy has already returned a portion of al-Rashid‚Äôs donations due to his involvement in a domestic assault incident. 
Ibrahim al-Rashid allegedly forced his way into his estranged wife‚Äôs Pennsylvania home, where al-Rashid allegedly ‚Äúgrabbed her by the wrist, struck her about the head and face with a closed fist then threw her to the ground,‚Äù according to a copy of the police report viewed by the Free Beacon. 
Following the 2014 incident, al-Rashid allegedly sent his wife a text message stating, ‚ÄúI am not sorry this time I hope you die in hell,‚Äù according to the police report. 
Murphy, a longtime friend of al-Rashid, was recently forced to donate around $16,000 in campaign funds to domestic violence groups after the assault charge became a public liability for the campaign. Murphy also returned all of the donations made by al-Rashid during the last three political cycles. 
Is the Clinton Foundation involved in this? Do the Clintons do their business in golden and marble toilets? 
Nasser al-Rashid, one of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs wealthiest figures and an adviser to the country‚Äôs royal family, has donated somewhere between $1 million to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, putting him in an elite category of prominent donors.

College is now a politically correct joke . 
Suffolk University‚Äôs interim president said Tuesday that the college will hold mandatory microaggression training for all faculty in response to an outcry last week after a Latina student wrote a viral blog post saying she was the victim of a professor‚Äôs racial bias. 
What did this racial bias involve? 
Tiffany Martinez.said an unidentified Suffolk sociology professor handed back a paper she had written and in front of the class and told Martinez, ‚ÄúThis is not your language,‚Äù insinuating that Martinez had plagiarized. 
Martinez posted a photo of the paper on her blog, showing where the professor appears to have written ‚Äúplease go back and indicate where you cut and paste.‚Äù The professor had circled the word ‚Äúhence‚Äù in the paper and wrote, ‚Äúthis is not your word.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIn this interaction, my undergraduate career was both challenged and critiqued,‚Äù the student wrote. ‚ÄúIt is worth repeating how my professor assumed I could not use the word ‚Äúhence,‚Äù a simple transitory word that connected two relating statements. The professor assumed I could not produce quality research.‚Äù 
Most college students, regardless of whether their ancestors originated from southern Europe or not, do not tend to use hence in a sentence. Hence, it's the sort of word that professors seize on and suspect that what they are seeing is cut and paste material. Tiffany's interaction has happened thousands of times with students regardless of race. 
But Tiffany is lucky enough to be a privileged minority. Which means that she can't be treated like everyone else lest she whine about it and a flood of social justice crybullies descend on Suffolk U. 
Kelly, the interim president, also sent a note to the school on Friday after the Buzzfeed article was posted. 
‚ÄúThe truth is that all of us here at Suffolk should be concerned about any student feeling this way,‚Äù Kelly wrote in her Tuesday blog post. She said the school has experienced an outpouring of support for Martinez from other students, faculty and staff. 
Privilege. This is what it looks like. 
Scholars and Rogues fights a last stand against the decline and fall of journalism by stating the obvious . 
In short, what we have here isn‚Äôt merely iffy reporting on an academic dustup. It‚Äôs a microcosm of what has happened to journalism in modern America. These headlines are certain to entice Web surfers to click, and if the ‚Äúreporters‚Äù can so easily be suckered into outrage then how can we possibly expect a rational reading by the average product of the American ed system, which has been stripped of all pretense at teaching critical thinking. 
The result: an emotionally pitched, unsubstantiated claim of injustice has been instantly transformed into cold, hard fact. 
Well yes. 
Meanwhile here's a sample of Tiffany's writing. You can decide whether she organically used hence in a sentence.

In an online Morning Consult poll of approximately 3,200 registered voters, only 19 percent agreed with the statement that prosecutors should wait until after Election Day to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials. Instead,60 percent agreed that prosecutors should be able to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials close to Election Day even if it might affect the election. (Another 21 percent said they don‚Äôt know or had no opinion.) 
In news that's shocking to the Times, the American people are once again out of step with their left-wing masters. 
When the investigation into Mrs. Clinton was mentioned before the question, partisans differed by almost 50 percentage points in their attitude toward pre-election disclosures, which were endorsed by 83 percent of Republicans but just 34 percent of Democrats ‚Äî an even larger gap than observed with the generic prompt. By contrast, mentioning Mr. Trump‚Äôs foundation eliminated the gap between the parties in support for publicizing investigations, which was backed by 57 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans. 
One might conclude that Republicans are the more ethical and honest party.";english;2016-11-03T06:48:44.984+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Majority of Americans Side With FBI Over Hillary;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/hellary_1.png?itok=mDTKsheo;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Nothing ought to be plainer, and yet nothing is more obscured, than the meaning of the Islamic concept of jihad. Even if its meaning were at all unclear, every day Islamic jihadists do their best to remind us of what it is. The confusion arises, of course, from the fact that jihad and related concepts are the object of a massive misinformation and disinformation campaign, making books such as William Kilpatrick‚Äôs The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad so vitally necessary. 
Kilpatrick covers that propaganda campaign ably in this lucid and genial book, which not only explains from Islamic texts and teachings why ISIS and Boko Haram (and other jihad terror groups) are not only not un-Islamic, as is frequently claimed, but quintessentially Islamic ‚Äì for the Qur‚Äôan, as Kilpatrick explains, commands jihad, and Muhammad, who is considered in Islamic theology to the perfect man, to be imitated by Muslims whenever, wherever, and however possible, not only commanded jihad warfare but waged it himself. 
Kilpatrick also helpfully takes up common objections to this line of argumentation ‚Äì notably the question of why, if Islam really teaches warfare against unbelievers and their subjugation under the hegemony of Islamic law, most Muslims are peaceful. ‚ÄúPeaceful Islam,‚Äù Kilpatrick points out, ‚Äúwhich Western leaders are counting on to win out over the more violent versions touted by the terrorists, is a holdover from the long-dead colonial era.‚Äù Indeed so: the formulation of jihad as primarily an interior spiritual struggle was touted by Islamic scholars at the height of the colonial period, so as to allow for accommodation of the colonial occupiers, who weren‚Äôt going away in the foreseeable future. Once they did abscond, however, the conditions that called forth such accommodative teachings no longer existed, and Saudi-funded jihad preachers traversed the globe calling Muslims back to jihad, ‚Äúthe forgotten obligation‚Äù of warfare against unbelievers. 
The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad shows that this transition had nothing to do with poverty among Muslims or discrimination against them, and indeed, that no conciliation or concession on the part of Western non-Muslims will ever blunt the force of the jihad imperative, since it is rooted in Islamic theological principles that are not susceptible to the prevailing political winds. 
The most valuable sections, however, of this useful and engaging book are the second, ‚ÄúJihad Without Bombs,‚Äù and the third, ‚ÄúDefeating Jihad.‚Äù For even as violent jihad becomes an increasingly common feature of the Western landscape, more insidious and damaging in the long run may be the stealth jihad that proceeds due to the appeasement policies that Western governments indefatigably pursue, and the politically correct straitjacket on the public discourse that has for well over a decade now hindered, and usually prevented outright, honest discussion in the mainstream media of the nature and magnitude of this threat. Kilpatrick points out that ‚Äúaccording to Reporters Without Borders, the U.S. has dropped to forty-sixth place in press freedom.‚Äù One of the principal ways in which the press today reveals itself to be a mouthpiece of moneyed elites is in its deliberate attempts to obfuscate the ideological roots of the jihad threat, and its ongoing campaign, every time there is a jihad attack, to inundate us with articles explaining that Islam is really quite wonderful and has nothing to do with this violence, nothing at all. 
But Kilpatrick details how the media and governing elites are not in the least singular in appearing determined to foster complacency and ignorance among the people they should be enlightening and protecting. The churches are in on the act as well: ‚ÄúChristians,‚Äù writes Kilpatrick, ‚Äúhave been lulled into complacency by the oft-repeated emphasis on the similarities between their faith and the faith of Muslims‚Äù ‚Äì an emphasis all too many Church leaders, including, of course, Pope Francis, relentlessly hammer home, heedless of the danger in which they are putting their flock by leaving them intellectually, spiritually, and physically defenseless in the face of an advancing and growing threat. 
That‚Äôs why the most apposite sentence in this entire book is the second sentence of the chapter headed ‚ÄúStrategies for Victory‚Äù: ‚ÄúFirst we‚Äôve got to get serious.‚Äù The West suffers from a collective lack of seriousness that could, in the end, be fatal. The frivolity is at the top, fueled by globalist internationalists who are using the complacency the media, the government and the Church are fostering for their own ends. The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad is the perfect book for those who don‚Äôt know just how bad things are, and how likely they are to get even worse ‚Äì as well as for all who wish to chart a way out of this madness. It can be done. William Kilpatrick does it, quite well, in this book.

Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. 
Once upon a time, fact-checking meant that newspapers, radio stations and television news broadcasts were obligated to check their facts before broadcasting or publishing them. Some newspapers and magazines boasted renowned departments filled with intellectuals whose restless minds roved over each line to ensure that the fewest possible errors would appear under that publication‚Äôs masthead. 
But fact-checking of the media by itself has declined almost as badly as the Roman Empire. Errors routinely appear under storied mastheads followed by corrections that are published as a janitorial duty. There is very little concern for the facts even among the great names of publishing and broadcasting. 
The media has stopped fact-checking itself and it now uses fact-checking largely to refer to a type of opinion journalism in which it ‚Äúchecks the facts‚Äù of public figures. The fall of fact-checking within the media has paralleled the rise of fact checking by the media of its political opponents. The media has become factless even as it deploys a term that once meant self-correction to instead correct others. 
Fact checks once meant that reporters were expected to be accurate. These days they‚Äôre only expected to be politically correct. The media deploys fact checks to check political correctness, not facts. Its fact checks routinely venture into areas that are not only partisan, but subjective matters of opinion. 
Consider Politico‚Äôs often mocked ‚Äúfact check‚Äù of Donald Trump as to whether ISIS was indeed unbelievably evil. Under a banner headline, ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths‚Äù, it zoomed in on a quote from his Florida rally. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre presiding over something that the world has not seen. The level of evil is unbelievable,‚Äù Trump had said. 
Politico swooped in to correct the candidate with its fact check. ‚ÄúJudging one ‚Äòlevel of evil‚Äô against another is subjective, but other groups in recent history have without any question engaged in as widespread killing of civilians as ISIS.‚Äù 
There were no facts being checked here because Politico doesn‚Äôt seem to know what a fact even is. 
The only information conveyed by this ‚Äúfact check‚Äù is that Politico, like the rest of the media, does not like Donald Trump and would find a way to argue with him if he said that the sky was blue. 
In the Daily Show media culture where overt bias and trolling are virtues, fact-checking is just another snotty variety of editorializing that attempts to compensate for perceptions of bias not with higher ethical and factual standards, but by rebranding its editorials as fact checks to gain credibility. 
The ISIS evil ‚Äúfact check‚Äù of Trump came from the same media outlet whose White House reporter decided that the Wisconsin flag, which carries the date 1848 to mark the state‚Äôs admission to the Union, was ‚Äúa flag for the local union, Wisconsin 1848‚Äù. Politico ran an entire story asserting that Obama was flying a labor flag to oppose Governor Walker because its reporter couldn‚Äôt process basic history. 
This is what happens when media outlets think that fact-checking is something that they do to Republicans rather than to themselves. 
Fact-checking was one of those dinosaurs of journalism, like objectivity, which is viewed as largely irrelevant in a media culture whose Edward R. Murrow is Jon Stewart. Today‚Äôs millennial journalists spend most of their time exchanging sarcastic quips with their peers on Twitter, aspire to found their own Vox sites and write viral blog posts that seek a new angle on a trending left-wing narrative. 
Fact checks often function as narrative defenses and meme attacks. That‚Äôs why the Washington Post decided to ‚Äúfact check‚Äù a Saturday Night Live gag about Obama‚Äôs illegal alien amnesty. It‚Äôs not that anyone imagines that Saturday Night Live is in the business of producing facts that need checking. The Post was just worried that one of its jokes would go viral and hurt Obama and his agenda. 
It‚Äôs the same reason that the paper ‚Äúfact checked‚Äù a 13-year-old boy who claimed he was blocked by Obama on Twitter. This isn‚Äôt about the facts. It‚Äôs paranoia about social media narratives going viral. 
This is more understandable if you stop thinking of the media in the old-fashioned sense as a series of papers, radio and television stations and start thinking of it as a massive machine that advocates for left-wing policies using its massive infrastructure and wealth to monopolize internet narratives. 
Media outlets trade on their history, but they don‚Äôt resemble their past selves in any meaningful way. 
The New Yorker once boasted a fact-checking department that was famous for its range, its depth and its resourcefulness in running down even the most obscure facts. But what use is such a thing at David Remnick‚Äôs New Yorker whose big draw comes from Andy Borowitz‚Äôs insipid near parodies? The New Republic went from respected liberal publication to another snarky and shrill social justice blog. CBS News cited a psychic site to explain that a fly landed on Hillary‚Äôs face to help her cope with stress. 
This isn‚Äôt material that exists in the same realm as facts. It‚Äôs snarky contempt alternating with lowest common denominator propaganda. Left-wing journalism, like most left-wing culture, is totalitarian anti-intellectualism masquerading as enlightened intellectualism. The Soviet Union was quite fond of culture. It just hated the creative process that produced it because it was independent of Communist ideology. The left loves journalism; it just hates the objectivity that validates journalism as more than propaganda. 
It‚Äôs this perverse anti-intellectualism that turned fact-checking from self-discipline to attack ad. Once journalism became pure left-wing advocacy, it also became inherently correct by virtue of being left-wing and was not in need of having its facts checked. When fact checks stopped being something that journalists did to themselves, first facts and then fact checks became meaningless. Unable to even recognize a fact, media fact checkers just wrote editorials which spiced their left-wing attacks on Republicans liberally with cargo cult invocations to ‚Äúfact‚Äù as if it were some deity. 
The average media fact check is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy for thinking adults. 
At the Washington Post , Michelle Yee ‚Äúfact checks‚Äù Donald Trump‚Äôs comment that Hillary‚Äôs email scandal is bigger than Watergate and concludes that since Watergate led to Nixon‚Äôs resignation and Hillary‚Äôs email scandal has yet to lead to any convictions, it can‚Äôt be bigger than Watergate. Since the scandal has yet to be resolved, a fact check of it could only take place in the future. 
CNN featured Toronto Star ‚Äúfact checker‚Äù Daniel Dale who claimed that Trump said 35 lies in one day. 
The list of ‚Äúlies‚Äù included deeming Trump‚Äôs statement that Hillary would raise taxes false because her plan only taxes the rich, asserting that there is no such thing as a ‚Äúphony poll‚Äù and denying that Hillary Clinton had received debate questions. Some of these ‚Äúlies‚Äù are themselves lies. Others, like Yee, show an inability to even understand what a fact is and what can and can‚Äôt be deemed false. 
Just how degraded fact checking had become was made manifest when Hillary Clinton pleaded at the debate, ‚ÄúPlease, fact checkers, get to work.‚Äù Her campaign site touted its own ‚Äúfact checking‚Äù which was mostly indistinguishable from the media‚Äôs fact checking. That was a commentary on the transformation of the media into a left-wing politician‚Äôs spin center. 
Nearly every media outlet now boasts a fact check blog or headlines touting fact checks. But the biggest fact checking department of the media, rather than by the media, isn‚Äôt in the United States, but in Germany. In America, fact checking has become a type of partisan attack launched by media outlets at their political opponents. It‚Äôs bigger than ever and also more worthless than ever because it is factless. 
And those who do it often not only don‚Äôt know the facts, but don‚Äôt even know what a fact is.  ";english;2016-11-03T07:22:47.661+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;The Factless Fact-Checkers;0.0;http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;hate

The Obama Department of Justice has been corruptly aiding and abetting the Democratic Party‚Äôs presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, to escape legal accountability for her actions. From Attorney General Loretta Lynch on down through the Justice Department‚Äôs political ranks, the Department has blocked the FBI from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion. Whether it is Hillary‚Äôs use of a private e-mail server while serving as Secretary of State or her involvement in the pay-for-play Clinton enterprise known as the Clinton Foundation, the Obama administration is applying a banana republic-style double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her. 
Lynch and President Obama were reportedly furious with FBI Director James Comey for sending a letter to Congress on October 28 th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the e-mail case had come to light, which required further investigation. This evidence consisted of a batch of e-mails FBI investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to Anthony Weiner, Clinton confidante Huma Abedin‚Äôs estranged husband, while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving Weiner‚Äôs alleged sexting to an underage girl. Comey sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let Hillary off the hook in the e-mail case last July. He was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from FBI agents who felt betrayed by that decision. 
Department of Justice officials had leaned on Comey not to send the letter to Congress, claiming that it would violate Department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election. To his credit, Comey ignored the Department officials‚Äô objections, claiming he had an obligation to keep the Congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case. 
Democrats, who had lavished praise on Comey for his July decision, lashed out at Comey for sending his letter updating Congress. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid went so far as to make the baseless charge that Comey may have violated the law by informing Congress, because, Reid argued, he appeared to be taking sides in an election. The disgraced former Attorney General Eric Holder, held in contempt of Congress for withholding information relating to the Fast and Furious scandal, said about Comey‚Äôs action, ‚ÄúI fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. It is up to the director to correct his mistake ‚Äî not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people.‚Äù 
Since when has Holder been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the American people? Holder had already contributed to the erosion of public trust, with his blatant politicization of the Obama Department of Justice. As evidenced by the Obama Department of Justice‚Äôs handling of the multiple FBI investigations involving Hillary Clinton, the Department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption. It interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in Hillary‚Äôs favor, ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed Obama and preserve his legacy. 
First, the Department of Justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the e-mail case or in connection with the FBI‚Äôs investigation of the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play allegations. ‚ÄúThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,‚Äù former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said . ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I‚Äôm sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.‚Äù 
Kallstrom‚Äôs belief that Lynch acted to influence the results of the FBI probes in Hillary‚Äôs favor is buttressed by Lynch‚Äôs 30 minute private tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before FBI Director Comey faced the cameras on July 5 th with his exculpatory announcement. 
Second, at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the e-mail case, including to Hillary‚Äôs lawyer and confidante Cheryl Mills and to Platte River Networks‚Äô Paul Combetta. It appears that Combetta had previously lied to government investigators ‚Äì a crime in itself ‚Äì while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently Bleachbited e-mails to delete them, even though they had been subject to a previously issued Congressional subpoena. The immunity agreements garnered nothing in return, but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the FBI‚Äôs separate Clinton Foundation investigation. Apparently, the Department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant, rather than granting useless immunities, in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the e-mail investigation that might have been contained in those devices. 
Third, the Department and FBI did not conduct their last minute interview of Hillary Clinton under oath and allowed Cheryl Mills ‚Äì herself a material witness ‚Äì to sit in during Hillary‚Äôs interview. They did not ask pertinent follow-up questions. There was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of Hillary‚Äôs statements during the interview against her sworn Congressional testimony or her many public statements. 
Fourth, the Department of Justice reportedly refused to allow the FBI to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play allegations. In fact, senior Department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough FBI investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further. Such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while Hillary was Secretary of State, their true motivations and any favors extended by the State Department in return. 
Finally, the cross-connections between the Clintons and some high level Department of Justice and FBI officials cry out for recusal. But not so in this administration. For example, the wife of the deputy FBI director who was involved in the laggard Clinton Foundation investigation, Andrew McCabe, just happened to have received a large donation from close Clinton ally Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to her 2015 run for the State Senate. 
To make matters worse, the Obama Department of Justice assigned Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik, a close friend of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager John Podesta, to communicate with Congress about what Kadzik promised would be a ‚Äúthorough‚Äù review of the newly discovered e-mails from Anthony Weiner‚Äôs online account. 
Podesta praised Kadzik in an e-mail to an Obama campaign official back in 2008 as a ‚ÄúFantastic lawyer,‚Äù and said about his pal, ‚ÄúKept me out of jail.‚Äù Their history together goes further back than that. During the waning days of Bill Clinton‚Äôs presidency, it was Kadzik, then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive Marc Rich, who lobbied Podesta, then serving as Bill Clinton‚Äôs chief of staff, for a presidential pardon on his client‚Äôs behalf. Kadzik‚Äôs lobbying effort, no doubt helped along by contributions to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Senate campaign and to Bill Clinton‚Äôs presidential library, paid off. Bill Clinton delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office. 
Kadzik joined the Department of Justice in April 2013, first as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, and then as the Principal Deputy. With the Podesta connection intact, Kadzik has served as a highly placed Clinton campaign mole in the Department. An e-mail dated May 19, 2015 from Kadzik to Podesta, released by WikiLeaks , proves the point. Bearing the subject heading ‚ÄúHeads Up,‚Äù Kadzik advised Podesta about upcoming Congressional testimony by the head of the Department‚Äôs Civil Division, and about another filing in the Freedom of Information case that would mean ‚Äúit will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails.‚Äù Podesta forwarded Kadzik‚Äôs heads up e-mail to several senior Hillary Clinton campaign officials with the admonition: ‚ÄúAdditional chances for mischief.‚Äù 
Exploiting his coordinating role in the re-opened e-mail investigation and contacts with FBI investigators, Kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal Podesta and to provide inside information to the Clinton campaign‚Äôs supporters in Congress as well. 
The Clintons manage to turn virtually everything they touch into a cesspool of corruption. The Obama Department of Justice is no exception.

Just one of those ""honest mistakes"" leading to a massive violation of national security by anyone who felt like it. These are still reports from various insider sources, but if true, this would be a major factor in how much damage Hillary's cover up did . 
Authorities now believe there is about a 99 percent chance that up to five foreign intelligence agencies may have accessed and taken emails from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private server, two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations told Fox News.

When Comey publicly discussed the Clinton email case back in July, he also said that while there was no evidence hostile actors breached the server, it was ‚Äúpossible‚Äù they had gained access.

There have been various insider reports on the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary email scandal on FOX. 
But the curious thing about this Wall Street Journal report is that it's clearly aimed at defending Hillary Clinton and smearing the FBI in the battle with Obama's DOJ officials who wanted to shut it down due to their support of Hillary Clinton. 
Which means that its information that damns its own side gains more credibility. 
Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. 
Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to ‚Äústand down,‚Äô‚Äô a person familiar with the matter said. 
A stand down order. Much like the one in Libya. 
And remember McCabe, whose wife's Democratic political campaign received major cash from a Clinton ally? 
Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI‚Äôs No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation. 
Not a surprise either. 
The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn‚Äôt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out. 
FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. 
As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn‚Äôt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. 
And that's what blew up when Team Hillary lashed out at the FBI. It was a covert war between Hillary's DOJ allies and the FBI coming out of the cold. And they pushed so hard even McCabe was disgusted. 
As a result of those complaints, these people said, a senior Justice Department official called the FBI deputy director, Mr. McCabe, on Aug. 12 to say the agents in New York seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions, these people said. The conversation was a tense one, they said, and at one point Mr. McCabe asked, ‚ÄúAre you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?‚Äô‚Äô The senior Justice Department official replied: ‚ÄùOf course not.‚Äù

There was a day when being threatened with prison and torture (even figuratively) by an enemy Stalinist regime that jailed and tortured political prisoners (many of them U.S. citizens) at a higher rate than Stalin during the Great Terror would be considered an enormous asset for a U.S. Presidential candidate. 
But the ringing communist endorsement for Hillary Clinton gets even ‚Äúbetter:‚Äù 
‚Äú Hillary Clinton is our only hope of detaining barbarism!‚Äù 
So warns the eunuch scribe for a totalitarian regime that murdered more Cubans in its first three years in power than Hitler murdered Germans during his first six‚Äì and in the process converted a highly-civilized, immigrant-swamped nation into a slum/sewer with the Hemisphere‚Äôs highest suicide rate, which is ravaged by tropical diseases, where tens of thousands have died trying to escape, where alley cats constitute a delicacy and where ox-carts represent luxury transportation. 
‚ÄúOn a few occasions Trump has even suggested the assassination of Hillary Clinton!‚Äù 
So warn the notorious assassins of suddenly inconvenient colleagues ranging from Camilo Cienfuegos to Tony De la Guardia to Manuel ‚ÄúBarbarroja‚Äô Pineiro. Yes, the Castro regime ‚Äúdevoured its own children‚Äù even more voraciously than even Lenin and Stalin‚Äôs. 
‚ÄúThe news are dominated by revelations‚Äîsome on video‚Äîshowing Trump‚Äôs obscenity and male chauvinist conduct‚Äîalong with his treatment of women as sex objects!‚Äù 
So warns the Stalinist regime that jailed and tortured 35,150 Cuban women for political crimes, a totalitarian horror utterly unknown in the Western Hemisphere until the Castro brothers and Che Guevara took power. Some of these Cuban ladies suffered twice as long in Castro‚Äôs Gulag as Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered in Stalin‚Äôs. 
Their prison conditions were described by former political prisoner Maritza Lugo. ‚ÄúThe punishment cells measure 3 feet wide by 6 feet long. The toilet consists of an 8 inch hole in the ground through which cockroaches and rats enter, especially in cool temperatures the rat come inside to seek the warmth of our bodies and we were often bitten. The suicide rate among women prisoners was very high.‚Äù 
On Christmas Eve of 1961 a Cuban woman named Juana Diaz Figueroa spat in the face of the executioners who were binding and gagging her. Castro and Che Guevara's KGB-trained secret police had found her guilty of feeding and hiding ‚Äúbandits‚Äù (Cuban rednecks who took up arms to fight the Stalinist theft of their land to build Soviet‚Äìstyle Kolkhozes.) When the blast from Castroite firing squad demolished her face and torso Juana was six months pregnant. 
‚ÄúThey started by beating us with twisted coils of electric cable,‚Äù recalls former Cuba political prisoner Ezperanza Pena from exile today. ‚ÄúI remember Teresita on the ground with all her lower ribs broken. Gladys had both her arms broken. Doris had her face cut up so badly from the beatings that when she tried to drink, water would pour out of her lacerated cheeks.‚Äù 
‚ÄúOn Mother‚Äôs Day they allowed family visits,‚Äù recalls Manuela Calvo from exile today.‚Äù But as our mothers and sons and daughters were watching, we were beaten with rubber hoses and high-pressure hoses were turned on us, knocking all of us the ground floor and rolling us around as the guards laughed and our loved-ones screamed helplessly.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhen female guards couldn‚Äôt handle us male guards were called in for more brutal beatings. I saw teen-aged girls beaten savagely, their bones broken, their mouths bleeding ,‚Äù recalls Polita Grau. 
Thousands upon thousands of Cuban women have also drowned, died of thirst or have been eaten alive by sharks attempting to flee the regime founded by the folks who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton. This from a nation formerly richer than half the nations of Europe and deluged by immigrants from same. 
Remember how Donald Trump was taken greatly to task by the media for not quickly repudiating David Duke‚Äôs (so-called) endorsement? 
Well, we certainly look for the media to take Hillary Clinton similarly to task for not instantly repudiating the endorsement of mass-jailing, mass-torturing, mass-murdering Stalinists. 
After all, recalling the ‚Äústicks and stones can break my bones‚Äù riddle of our childhood, David Duke‚Äôs crimes‚Äù consist of words (‚Äúhate-speech.‚Äù) Whereas the (literal) sticks, stones--and chains, manacles, bullwhips and bullets--of the fine folks so enthusiastically endorsing Hillary Clinton have caused untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people.";english;2016-11-03T19:36:50.223+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Hillary's Castro Endorsement;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/castro.jpg?itok=y_1T930P;0;1;0;0;0;hate

If David Frum had suggested that Hillary Clinton used to play for the Patriots, I would have found his argument a little more credible than claiming that she is a patriot. 
But she is a patriot. She will uphold the sovereignty and independence of the United States. She will defend allies. She will execute the laws with reasonable impartiality. She may bend some rules for her own and her supporters‚Äô advantage. She will not outright defy legality altogether. Above all, she can govern herself; the first indispensable qualification for governing others. 
This is under an Atlantic piece headlined, ""The Conservative Case for Hillary"" which also contends, ""Why support a candidate who rejects your preferences and offends your opinions? Don‚Äôt do it for her‚Äîdo it for the republic, and the Constitution."" 
The trouble with this line of argument is that Hillary's own agenda includes a rejection of the First and Second Amendment. It's a rather unusual way to support the Constitution by destroying it. 
Then there's the whole Hillary is a quarterback for the New England Patriots business. Who has ever accused Hillary Clinton of being a patriot? How was this patriotism manifested? In Benghazi? In Iran? In Russia? I'll skip over the ""outright defy legality altogether"" argument. Though it's certainly sad that this is now considered some sort of high water mark. 
But can Hillary govern herself? Is the compulsive liar who can't help shouting, ""I was in New York on 9/11"" really capable of governing herself? 
""I am voting to defend Americans' profoundest shared commitment: a commitment to norms and rules that today protect my rights under a president I don‚Äôt favor, and that will tomorrow do the same service for you"".

Why does everyone love Hillary Clinton? It's hard to say. Her unfavorable ratings have hit 60%. That makes her more popular than 
1. The Bubonic Plague 
2. ObamaCare 
3. Osama bin Laden's corpse 
It's not much to go on. But the Atlantic decided to run a piece by Chimamanda Adichie titled,""Why Is Hillary Clinton So Widely Loved?"" 
Your response to seeing the name Chimamanda Adichie was probably huh. Unless you're a gender studies student at an Ivy. In which case you know exactly who she is and love her. Chimamanda Adichie is a Nigerian novelist whose ""We should all be feminists"" is big in those circles. 
The Clinton campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by Adichie was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned Obama poetry. And like most Hillary branding, it fails badly. 
There are howlers like, ""There are millions who admire the tapestry of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs past"" and ""There are people who, when Hillary Clinton becomes the first woman to be president of the United States, will weep from joy"". It's not quite a hymn to Comrade Stalin. Nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck. 
And then there's the phrasing. Oh the phrasing. ""Hillary Clinton was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the American public as the first lady of Arkansas."" 
This is an awkward attempt to channel that Obama poetry, but instead it reads like a DVD manual badly translated from the Japanese. 
The Atlantic piece is full of lines that straddle the border between tin-eared propagandistic cliche and just bad writing. 
""She was a lawyer full of dreams: 
""She was guilty of not being a traditional first lady. She offended the old patriarchal order."" 
Then there's the theme of the article, which is to just deny reality. 
""A conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first lady, and the label stuck because it was repeated over and over‚Äîand it was a convenient label to harness misogyny. If she was a liar, then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent. ‚ÄúLiar‚Äô has re-emerged during this election even though Politifact, a respected source of information about politicians, has certified that she is more honest than most politicians"" 
The perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after Hillary Clinton shouted at a rally that she had been in New York on 9/11. But don't worry. Hillary is more honest than most politicians. A site supporting her said so. 
"" Other words have been repeated over and over, with no context, until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life. Especially ‚Äúemails.‚Äù The press coverage of ‚Äúemails‚Äù has become an unclear morass where ‚Äúemails‚Äù must mean something terrible, if only because of how often it is invoked."" 
How about ""Classified emails""? Or ""illegal server""? Or ""violation of regulations dealing with the handling of classified material""? That's got lots of context. Or ""cover-up"". 
""The people who love Hillary Clinton know that the IT system at the State Department is old and stodgy, nothing like a Blackberry‚Äôs smooth whirl. Hillary Clinton was used to her Blackberry, and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of state."" 
People who love Hillary know that she love high tech Blackberry. Hillary love Blackberry. She is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl. Politifact thrums with life. Says her Blackberry is more honest than the iPhone. Hillary has many dreams of thrumming Blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order IT system. 
""The American conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the ‚Äúemails‚Äù story out of proportion, soon followed, almost bashfully, by the rest of the American media"" 
Is that how it works in Nigeria? Because that's not how it works in America. 
""There is no objective basis on which to equate Hillary Clinton to her opponent."" 
They're both mammals? They need oxygen to live? They're better writers than Chimamanda Adichie. 
""The people who love Hillary Clinton see the failings of the general American media, where news entertains rather than informs. They bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous tone"" 
They bristle and they hug their Blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy IT systems will prevent Hillary from being the thrumming First Lady of North America. 
""They know that she is a bit too careful, but they understand that she has to be, that she cannot afford spontaneity."" 
You would think with all those six figure speeches, she could. afford a little 
""her actions so falsely magnified, that she leaned into caution, wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted "" 
And wrapped in her caution, her whirling Blackberry in one hand, she bristled at the public, retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past. 
""There are millions of Americans who do not have the self-indulgent expectation that a politician be perfect. They are frustrated that Hillary Clinton is allowed no complexity. ""

In the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. 
The word ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it‚Äôs still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. 
But that‚Äôs exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary‚Äôs opponent in this election. 
The FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary‚Äôs people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn‚Äôt be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. 
The FBI‚Äôs leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI‚Äôs credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. 
The covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama‚Äôs DOJ people has gone explosively public. 
The New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, ‚ÄúJames Comey Role Recalls Hoover‚Äôs FBI, Fairly or Not‚Äù practically admits up front that it‚Äôs spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey‚Äôs resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. 
James Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the ‚Äúvast right wing conspiracy‚Äù was a stretch. 
Countless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what‚Äôs a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. 
Senator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. 
If James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. 
Not too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner‚Äôs computer? 
Either Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he‚Äôs just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary‚Äôs victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. 
The only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. 
And it‚Äôs an interesting question. 
Hillary‚Äôs old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. 
Pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. 
There are two possible explanations. 
Hillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. 
But the other explanation is that her people panicked. 
Going to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It‚Äôs an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that‚Äôs not hubris, it‚Äôs fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. 
During the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. 
There‚Äôs only one reason for such bizarre behavior. 
The Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it‚Äôs gone all in on fighting the FBI. It‚Äôs an unprecedented step born of fear. It‚Äôs hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. 
Clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. 
You can smell the fear. 
The FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It‚Äôs finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that‚Äôs here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn‚Äôt how you react to smoke. It‚Äôs how you respond to a fire. 
The misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. 
The Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don‚Äôt want FBI investigators anywhere near it. 
The campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It‚Äôs also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It‚Äôs an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. 
Hillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she‚Äôs never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.

The mainstream media in Western Europe and North America isn‚Äôt even pretending to be an objective news source anymore; instead, ‚Äújournalists‚Äù are working openly to quell what looks increasingly, on both sides of the Atlantic, like a popular revolution against the hegemony of the self-appointed political and media aristocracy that seems hell-bent on driving Western civilization over the cliff. And so it‚Äôs time for another round of their Two-Minutes Hate against Dutch politician and freedom fighter Geert Wilders. 
Wilders has yet again gone on trial in the Netherlands for ‚Äúhate speech,‚Äù and this time the case against him is especially flimsy: as Europe is roiled by the criminal activity of Muslim migrants, he is being accused of ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù for saying that the massive influx of immigrants from Morocco (from which most of the Muslim migrants in the Netherlands come) has to be stopped. 
This trial could very easily backfire on the Dutch inquisitors, and make Wilders more popular than ever with the people of the Netherlands and Europe in general, as they are increasingly fed up with the political and media elites‚Äô forcing them to accept a massive influx of Muslim migrants that ensures a future only of civil strife, bloodshed, and Sharia oppression. 
Consequently, those elites are trying desperately to shore up their position. Wilders chanted ‚ÄúNo more Moroccans‚Äù at a rally. The horror! To any sane person, this means ‚ÄúStop the influx of Moroccan immigrants who only inflate crime rates and welfare rolls.‚Äù To the media, which at this point is quite insane, insofar as insanity means an inability or refusal to accept reality, this means ‚ÄúGenocide!‚Äù 
And so, in this Deutsche Welle (DW) piece by freelance ‚Äújournalist‚Äù Teri Schultz, we‚Äôre told that European Parliament lawmaker Cecile Kyenge, who was born in Congo, had ‚Äúnumerous racial slurs - not to mention, bananas, literally - thrown at her, along with suggestions she go back to ‚Äòher country.‚Äô‚Äù Does this have anything to do with the crime and civil strife that are the foundations for Wilders‚Äô position? Of course not, but Wilders, Schultz tells us, is (of course) ‚Äúfar-right,‚Äù that all-purpose and meaningless semaphore that serves only to signal to right-thinking Deutsche Welle readers that Wilders is, as far as the media elites are concerned, unsavory, and must be opposed and shunned, his positions left unexamined. 
Schultz contacted me to serve as the villain of her piece, being sure to tell her hapless readers that I am ‚Äúknown for extreme anti-Islam views,‚Äù to make sure that if any of them are foolish enough to find themselves agreeing with me, they will immediately reverse themselves and get their minds right. The term ‚Äúextreme‚Äù also, since the Western governing class unanimously refers to jihad terrorists as ‚Äúextremists,‚Äù also implies that I am a terrorist. 
After the article came out, I challenged Schultz on this; she replied: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think even you would consider your views ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô, do you?‚Äù I responded: ‚ÄúAbsolutely yes. My views were the broad mainstream in the Western world from 632 AD until the 1960s. What changed? Not Islamic teaching.‚Äù To that she said: ‚ÄúOkay. You‚Äôd have to argue it with another expert, which I am not. But thanks again for contributing.‚Äù Indeed, she is just a mouthpiece for the views the political and media elites want us to hold. 
In any case, Schultz‚Äôs article merely reveals the desperation of the ruling class and the self-appointed opinion-shapers. They can call those of us who wish to defend the people and culture of Europe and North America ‚Äúfar-right‚Äù and ‚Äúextreme‚Äù every day (and they do), but the public can see with their eyes what is happening. Wilders‚Äô popularity isn‚Äôt growing because he is a charming fellow (which is, of course, not to say that he isn‚Äôt). It‚Äôs growing because he speaks the truths that the political and media elites are in a frenzy to obscure. 
And it‚Äôs only going to get worse for them: the Brexit vote and the Trump candidacy (whether he wins or loses) shows that their hegemony is beginning to be challenged. Those challenges will continue, and grow. They will before too long be decisively voted out and repudiated.";english;2016-11-04T12:29:08.297+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;European Media Jihad Against Geert Wilders;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/geertwilderscampaignsberlinfreiheitpartyyc-m3ii-bqcl.jpg?itok=-hVAfmmr;0;1;0;0;0;hate

November 4, 2016 Ari Lieberman 
Israelis and the pro-Israel community at large will breathe a collective sigh of relief when Obama leaves office. During Obama‚Äôs tenure, relations with Israel were caustic at best. Barely five months after taking office, he publicly launched a scathing attack against Israel ‚Äì where he perversely insinuated a moral equivalence between Israeli and Palestinian actions ‚Äì and did so in one of the most virulently anti-Semitic countries on the planet. He later skipped over Israel despite the fact that Israel was a mere 20-minute plane ride away. That was Obama‚Äôs opening salvo against America‚Äôs closest ally. It was only downhill from there. 
Obama utilized high-level administration sources to leak negative information about Israel to sympathetic members of the press. In one such instance, an administration official ‚Äìprobably Ben Rhodes ‚Äì referred to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a ‚Äú chicken-Sh*t .‚Äù In another instance, Obama voiced concurrence with French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, when Sarkozy characterized Netanyahu as a ‚Äú liar .‚Äù 
Often, the Obama administration would subject Israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits. Israel‚Äôs defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata. In the most notorious incident, Obama left Netanyahu out in the cold while having dinner with Michelle and his daughters. One commentator dryly noted that Obama treated Netanyahu as though he was the president of Equatorial Guinea. 
Ultimately, Obama crossed the line and received significant pushback from Democratic lawmakers and donors. Obama got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deep-seeded animus against Israel never dissipated and relations with Israel‚Äôs prime minister remained toxic. 
Tensions surfaced again during Israel‚Äôs counter insurgency campaign against the Gaza-based terror group Hamas. Obama held up a shipment of Hellfire missiles to Israel and then tried to strong-arm Israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by Turkey and Qatar, two despotic nations that support Hamas and gave aid and comfort to Islamic State terrorists. 
Obama saw Netanyahu‚Äôs opposition to the JCPOA, the so-called Iran deal, as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations. The so-called ‚Äúsettlements‚Äù were another point of contention. Obama disregarded a letter of assurance to Israel provided by the Bush administration specifying that ‚ÄúIn light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population[s] centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Bush gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of Israel to build within those blocs. It is also important to note that no new settlement was created during Obama‚Äôs term of office and Netanyahu had even agreed to an unprecedented 10-month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories. But nothing was ever enough for Obama who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate Israel at every turn. His parting shot was at the United Nations General Assembly. During a recent address to that contemptible body, he explicitly singled out Israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of Indonesia. Obama‚Äôs moral compass had gone completely awry. 
Despite the fact that Obama is in his twilight months, he can still inflict immeasurable harm on Israel. According to a report featured in the Wall Street Journal , Obama is contemplating several options, each with significant negative implications for Israel. The report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after November 8, so as not to harm Clinton‚Äôs presidential prospects. 
He may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of Israeli communities living in East Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. Perhaps more ominously, he may seek to impose dictates on Israel utilizing the U.N. Security Council. 
In one such scenario, Obama may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring Israeli communities situated in Judea and Samaria to be illegal. Alternatively, the administration may seek formal recognition of the ‚ÄúState of Palestine‚Äù even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects Israel‚Äôs existence as a Jewish state. Lastly, he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant Israeli territorial concessions. 
The United States does not have to actively support any UNSC resolution to see the successful passage of anti-Israeli measures. It merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers. France, facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized Muslim population, has historically been the fiercest advocate for the Palestinian Arabs. It is likely that the administration would seek to have the French submit a draft resolution and the United States would simply abstain while the permanent and non-permanent members voted, thus guaranteeing passage. 
Israel has few friends on the Security Council and American collusion with a body that could arguably be considered today‚Äôs greatest purveyors of anti-Semitism, would be an act of extreme betrayal. It would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement. 
But Israel is not without recourse. There is strong bipartisan support for Israel in Congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the White House their strong opposition to U.N. involvement. 
Some, like the Jerusalem Post‚Äôs Caroline Glick, have suggested that the Israelis can reach out to the Russians with carrots in an effort to counter Obama‚Äôs nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch. Moscow has always been in the pockets of the Muslim bloc and its recent vote at UNESCO in support of a resolution denying the Jewish nexus to Jerusalem, serves to reinforce this view.

Time Magazine‚Äôs Joe Klein has just penned an article entitled ‚ÄúWhy Hillary Clinton Is the Only Choice to Keep America Great.‚Äù I feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of Primary Colors, the novel based on about Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992. 
The other Joe Klein laments that Hillary has been so ‚Äúseverely damaged in the course of the 30-year battering she‚Äôs received at the hands of extremists and the media.‚Äù Sorry, but Hillary‚Äôs wounds are self-inflicted. Her lies, greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for State Department business while she was Secretary of State and of the pay-for-play Clinton Foundation. 
‚ÄúThere is one part of Trump that is indisputably real: his ego,‚Äù the other Joe Klein wrote, as if Hillary were the epitome of humility and grace. 
‚ÄúThose who would put Clinton‚Äôs failings in the same league as Trump‚Äôs depravities are delusional,‚Äù declared Klein. I agree with his statement, but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances. Trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain. He did not ‚Äúhand pick‚Äù (Hillary‚Äôs word) an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security, let alone pick up the phone and contact Ambassador Chris Stevens directly. ""The government was not able to save four lives, to keep four lives safe. How can you keep a country safe?"" asked Stevens‚Äô former fianc√© in a rhetorical question that Hillary would be unable to answer. Trump did not lie to the families of those slain in Benghazi, as Hillary did. Trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government e-mails in order to evade the Freedom of Information Act, as Hillary did. 
In short, anyone who thinks that Hillary‚Äôs proven record of recklessness, mendacity, and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúdepravities‚Äù is ‚Äúdelusional.‚Äù 
The other Joe Klein complains that Trump deals in ‚Äústereotypes‚Äù - ‚Äúthe blacks,‚Äù ‚Äúthe Hispanics,‚Äù ‚Äúthe Muslims,‚Äù ‚Äúthe women‚Äù and, yes, even ‚Äúthe veterans.‚Äù Yet much of Hillary‚Äôs pitch is gender-based. Elect her because she is a woman. And she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets ‚Äì ‚Äúdeplorable,‚Äù ‚Äúracist,‚Äù ‚Äúsexist,‚Äù ‚Äúhomophobic,‚Äù ‚Äúxenophobic,‚Äù ‚ÄúIslamaphobic,‚Äù and ‚Äì for good measure - ‚Äúirredeemable.‚Äù 
The other Joe Klein charges that Trump is ‚Äúabout all that has gone wrong in our society, and nothing of what has gone right.‚Äù To paraphrase Bill Clinton, that would depend on what your definitions of ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù are. Is Hillary Clinton really right when she parrots Black Lives Matter‚Äôs stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù and ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù in this country? Is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police ‚Äúbrutality‚Äù aimed against African-Americans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined? I don‚Äôt think so. 
Hillary also represents the political correctness and anti-religious bigotry of the secular left elite that many Americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society. At the Women in the World Summit last year, for example, Hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women, ‚Äúdeep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.‚Äù Hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of Americans, reminiscent of President Obama‚Äôs contemptuous ‚Äòclinging to religion‚Äô quote back in 2008. 
Hillary‚Äôs key supporters and top aides have targeted the Catholic Church in particular for their notion of progressive reform. ‚ÄúThere needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,‚Äù wrote Sandy Newman, president of Voices for Progress, in an e-mail to Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman John Podesta. In response, Podesta picked up on the ‚Äúspring‚Äù theme. He wrote, ‚ÄúWe created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.‚Äù 
When Time Magazine‚Äôs Joe Klein talks about what is right or wrong in American society, he should get out of his Washington D.C. bubble more often and actually speak with the American people about their day-to-day concerns. Even if Hillary Clinton ends up winning the election, the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda.";english;2016-11-04T12:29:10.383+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Why Time Magazine‚Äôs Joe Klein Is So Wrong About Hillary Clinton;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/joe_klein_political_columnist_time_magazine_12992709403.jpg?itok=GDU_3pOl;0;1;0;0;0;hate

During his years as a student at Harvard Law School in the early 1980s, Tim Kaine took a year off from his legal studies in order to work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. During the nine months he spent there, Kaine developed a keen interest in the teachings of local priests who were adherents of liberation theology , which is essentially Marxism dressed up as Christianity. Kaine himself embraced liberation theology and later claimed that it had ‚Äúchanged‚Äù him and ‚Äúdeepened‚Äù him. After completing his legal education, Kaine joined a civil litigation firm and practiced law for 17 years. He also launched a career in local politics in the mid-1990s, and eventually went on to serve as governor of Virginia (2006-10) and as a U.S. senator (2013-present). This past July, Hillary Clinton named Kaine as her vice presidential running mate. 
Over the course of his political career, Kaine has developed some noteworthy ties to a number of Islamist individuals and organizations: In his role as Virginia's governor in 2007, Kaine appointed Esam Omeish, president of the Muslim Brotherhood -affiliated Muslim American Society (MAS), to Virginia‚Äôs Immigration Commission. Omeish had previously served as president of the National Muslim Students Association and as a board member of the Islamic Society of North America , both of which have deep ties to the Brotherhood. Omeish had also been a board chairman of the Islamic Center of Passaic County , a New Jersey mosque with significant terrorist connections. And he had been a vice president and board member of the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center , a Virginia mosque whose imams have included, among others, an Al-Qaeda operative and a supporter of suicide bombings. Prior to his appointment by Kaine, Omeish had described the Muslim Brotherhood as a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù organization; he had praised the former Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin as ‚Äúour beloved Sheikh‚Äù; and he had pledged to lend his assistance to those Palestinians who understood that ‚Äúthe jihad way is the way to liberate your land.‚Äù In May 2007, Kaine was the keynote speaker at the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation's ‚ÄúStanding for Justice Dinner.‚Äù In 2010, Kaine agreed to attend the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center's annual fundraising banquet. In September 2011, Kaine spoke at an event that presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to U.S. Muslim Brotherhood leader Jamal Barzinji , who was closely associated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad , Hamas, and the extremist International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT). In 2011-12, Kaine‚Äôs U.S. Senate campaign received $4,300 from officials of the Islamic Society of North America and the Council on American-Islamic Relations , plus another $3,500 from IIIT's president-of-finance , Hisham Al-Talib . 
In early 2015, Kaine objected strenuously when Republican House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to the U.S. Congress about the gravity of the growing Iranian nuclear threat and his (Netanyahu's) ‚Äú profound disagreement ‚Äù with the negotiated deal that the Obama Administration was pursuing with Iran. Kaine joined seven other Senate Democrats in boycotting Netanyahu‚Äôs speech. That summer, Kaine declared himself a ‚Äú strong supporter ‚Äù of the final agreement, which allowed the Islamist regime in Tehran to enrich uranium, build advanced centrifuges, purchase ballistic missiles, fund terrorism, and be guaranteed of having a near-zero breakout time to the development of a nuclear bomb approximately a decade down the road. In May 2015, Kaine was one of fourteen U.S. senators who wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to allow 65,000 people from war-torn, terrorism-ravaged Syria into the United States as refugees, despite many people's concern that terrorists could potentially infiltrate the refugee program. Later that same year, Kaine opposed a bill passed by the House of Representatives that would have required more careful vetting of Syrians and Iraqis before they could be admitted to the United States as refugees. ‚ÄúThese refugees are people who are terrorized, not terrorists,‚Äù Kaine said in a November 2015 interview wherein he claimed that ‚Äúthe refugee vetting process is one of the safest areas that we have.‚Äù In a speech on the Senate floor the following month, Kaine said: ‚ÄúI look at this refugee crisis as a test ‚Ä¶ about whether we, like [the biblical] Job, will be true to our principles or whether we‚Äôll abandon them.‚Äù He also urged his fellow legislators to emulate the example of the 17th-century ‚ÄúIndians down near Jamestown Island‚Äù who had helped starving English settlers to survive by offering ‚Äúan extension of a hand to strangers in a strange land.‚Äù Kaine ranks among the most left-wing political figures in the United States today. He is the only person with a 0% Lifetime Rating from the American Conservative Union, which has graded Members of Congress on their voting records each year since 1971. Similarly, ConservativeReview.com gives Kaine a 0% rating. In short, Tim Kaine is essentially a political mirror image of Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton picked him as her running mate because she saw him as someone who could effectively help her implement a radical leftist agenda.";english;2016-11-04T12:29:12.257+02:00;frontpagemag.com;US;34811.0;Potentially the Worst VP in American History;0.0;http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/11/tk.jpg?itok=Tgw5f2Qq;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Remember when Hillary Clinton was insisting that there was no FBI investigation of her, just a security review, even when the FBI rejected that claim? 
Well Andrea Mitchell, NBC's own Baghdad Bob, isn't giving up that claim so easily. Even while the rest of the Clinton clique is screeching against the FBI for investigating Hillary like bats from the nether regions of left-wing hell, Mitchell is sticking to the old spin. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary . Close your eyes and say it three times. The FBI is not investigating Hillary. It's not. It's not. 
In a complete state of denial on Thursday, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell interrupted live coverage of Donald Trump speaking at a Florida campaign rally to supposedly ‚Äúfact-check‚Äù the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the FBI was conducting an extensive investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs e-mail and charitable foundation scandals. 
Mitchell refused to accept reality: ‚ÄúJust a lot of fact-checking to do. She's not under criminal investigation. In fact, it's not an investigation. It's just a review of the e-mails. She did not lie to the FBI, according to James Comey. There was no grounds to prosecute her. So there are no lies, there‚Äôs no criminality.‚Äù She fretted: ‚ÄúI don't know even where to start....but I mean, we have to put it in some context.‚Äù 
The context is that defending Hillary Clinton has become a mental illness. 
But as I wrote earlier this week, fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary. Anyone who believes that is probably some sort of right-winger who listens to what the FBI actually says, rather than what NBC says that the FBI says.

The official media narrative is that Muslims are the world's greatest victims. The truth, especially in majority Muslim countries, is rather strikingly different . 
Crowds of Muslims attacked Hindu homes and temples in eastern Bangladesh this week, raising concerns that the authorities are not taking steps to curb rising religious tensions. 
Attacks on Hindus are not unusual in Bangladesh, but it is rare to see multiple crowds targeting temples in an organized way as they did on Sunday and Monday. 
Note the casual language of the Times. Muslim religious violence is commonplace in Bangladesh. It's just not common for it to be happening on this scale. 
But how could it be otherwise? Islam is structurally xenophobic, violently bigoted and racist down to its origins. Islam's faith is expressed in a violent campaign against non-Muslims. This is Jihad. 
Muslims attacking Hindus, Christians, Jews, Yazidis or any other group? That just means it must be Wednesday. Or any other day of the week. 
On Sunday, hundreds of Muslims entered a Hindu neighborhood, where they ransacked 15 temples and the homes of more than 100 families, Mr. Deb said. He said that the mob ‚Äúused long, hard sticks and locally made sharp weapons‚Äù to assault Hindus they found there, and that at least 20 people, including a priest, were wounded.

Don't look now, but #PardonHer talk is growing. 
Just as the Clinton campaign and its media allies rage against the FBI, some are looking for a pardon solution. And a way to spin that pardon as something other than a straight admission of guilt. How about political reconciliation and a way to defy those mean Republicans and take the issue of all the crimes that Hillary committed off the table? Here you go. 
It does not take much clairvoyance to predict that Clinton's most strident opponents may seek to extend the use criminal investigations as a political tactic to undermine her presidency if she wins the election next week. That prospect triggers a startling idea: Should President Barack Obamasimply pardon Clinton if she wins the election?... 
A presidential pardon could short circuit some of this maneuvering. The Constitution gives the president the power ""to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States,"" and it could be used here. The public is aware of the allegations against Clinton, yet she has continued to lead in election polls. If voters choose her for the presidency, their decision that the allegations are not disqualifying deserves respect. A presidential pardon could ratify that assessment. 
Yes, but what should Obama pardon Hillary Clinton for? Corruption, bribery, abuse of classified information? How about everything. Let's just print up a list of every possible crime and pardon Hillary for all of them. It would save time, energy and raise Hillary above the law. It would be a clear statement that she could get away with murder.

Issues surrounding a minimum wage bill, education and services are being utilized in attempts to overthrow the African National Congress 
South African President Jacob Zuma has come out publically to state that there are efforts underway by the West to undermine the African National Congress (ANC) government which has held power for over 22 years. 
A myriad of challenges are facing the South African ruling party including an economic recession, the bringing of several allegations about corruption within the office of the presidency, a declining stock market and national currency along with increasingly worsening relations with the United States. 
In Africa there are numerous examples from the post-colonial period of the last five decades where the intelligence and military apparatuses of the imperialist states have sought to reverse the forward progress of the masses of workers, farmers, youth and their leadership. In the recent period in the South American state of Brazil, the first woman President Dilma Rousseff of the Worker‚Äôs Party, was forcefully removed from office in a political coup. 
In addition to the decline in the South African economy largely due to the overall world crisis which has driven down commodity prices and systematically disinvested from the emerging states, there has been a fracturing of the national democratic movement and the workers organizations over contentious debates surrounding a way forward. In an October report delivered at the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) 17 th Congress in Durban, South Africa, Dr. Blade Nzimande, the Secretary General of the South African Communist Party (SACP), placed these contradictions inside the national democratic revolution and the largest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), within a broader context of the desire by the imperialist states to reverse the advances of the liberation struggles. 
In a recent article published by the Agence France Press (AFP), President Zuma emphasized that: ‚ÄúWestern powers want to remove the ANC because they do not want the ANC to develop relations with those countries which helped the party in the anti-apartheid struggle.‚Äù This statement was made by President Zuma on Nov. 19 laid the blame directly on certain Western countries which do not wish the ruling African National Congress success. 
Zuma spoke to ANC supporters at a rally in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga Province that the imperialist states were utilizing some ANC members to further their agenda, adding that some party members had been won over to the views of Western countries. The president said that those ANC members calling for his resignation were in fact serving the interests of the Western states. 
The Political Economy of Destabilization 
Since 1994 there have been substantial reforms initiated under the ANC government. There has been the construction of housing for the poor and working class, the expansion of healthcare, the breaking down of racial barriers in public facilities, along with access to household utilities and clean drinking water. 
However, the fundamental relations and ownership of production remains under the control of the capitalist class. As a manifestation of modern-day capitalism, high unemployment, rising costs of living including education fees as well as problems associated with service delivery, have continued. 
‚ÄúIn all other countries, the majority controls everything from politics, economy and defense . . . It‚Äôs only in this country (South Africa) where we don‚Äôt have economic freedom. It‚Äôs controlled by the minority and those who oppressed us,‚Äù Zuma stressed. (AFP, Nov. 21) 
The president went on to say: ‚ÄúThat is why they are scared that we will take away this economy. They want to take away the strength of the ANC because they know the ANC is the only organization trying to balance the scales.‚Äù 
Zuma said that his government would not break ties with longtime friends internationally in order to win the approval of the imperialist governments. The president had also spoke at the WFTU 17 th Congress noting that the capitalist system would not relinquish concessions to the working class without demands based upon mass struggle. 
Recounting the history of the national liberation movement in South Africa, Zuma said: ‚ÄúSocialist countries like Russia and China helped the ANC, giving it military training and aid during the anti-apartheid struggle. The socialist countries came to our aid. It was Russia who trained us and helped us with the tools to fight. China and other socialist countries helped us.‚Äù 
In addition Zuma said the Western states are retaliating against the ANC government due its affiliation with the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) Summit. The advent of such blocs among the emerging states was a threat to Western hegemony of the world economy. 
‚ÄúThey are fighting us because we joined BRICS. Some are in ANC gear but are in the company of the West. We are at war. We are going to protect the ANC,‚Äù Zuma emphasized. 
In an article published by the South African Mail & Guardian in reference to the stock values of holdings traded on the local market, it noted: ‚ÄúShould South Africa avoid having its credit rating cut to junk in the next two weeks, it could just be staving off the inevitable. More than half of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg said S&P Global Ratings will strip the nation of its investment-level rating. The median probability of South Africa retaining its current assessment in December is 45%, falling to only 20% in 2017, the survey shows. The economy faces a cut to junk on its foreign-currency credit rating as output is forecast to expand at the slowest pace this year since a 2009 recession, delaying the government‚Äôs plans to narrow the shortfall on the budget and rein in debt.‚Äù (Nov. 18) 
Debate Surrounds a National Minimum Wage Amid Allegation of Regime Change Agenda 
The ANC government has proposed the adoption of a national monthly minimum wage of 3,500 rand which is approximately $242 U.S. dollars. 47 percent of the working population earns less than this proposed amount. (BBC, Nov. 21) 
Despite the possible introduction of such legislation, it falls far short of what is actually needed to maintain a basic household. Prof. Chris Malikane of the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg suggested that 12,000 rand per month was essential in maintaining a decent home. (BBC, Nov. 21) 
This issue is controversial among the business interests which claim that any significant government-mandated increase in the minimum wage would create further unemployment which stands officially at around 25 percent. Over the last few years there have been large-scale job losses in the mining sector which is impacting economic recovery. 
Two years ago COSATU proposed a minimum wage of 4500 rand per month. With inflation since 2014 the amount would be at least 5000 today. 
Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said the 3,500 rand per month figure was decided by a panel of experts. Ramaphosa said: ‚ÄúWe are now a step closer to finalizing discussions on the national minimum wage. All social partners will now decide what their take is.‚Äù (BBC, Nov. 21) 
The ANC must address the issues of joblessness, poverty and service delivery in order to win back its two-thirds majority electoral base inside the country. Local governmental elections which were held in August saw a decline in support for the ruling party by approximately ten points although it remains by far the most popular party in South Africa winning 54 percent of the votes in the August poll. 
A commission report issued several weeks ago alleged that the government of President Zuma has been involved in corruption. Zuma has denied the charges and attempts to pass motions of no-confidence in parliament failed on numerous occasions. The current ANC leadership seems solidly committed to keeping Zuma in office until his term expires in 2019. 
The party maintains that Washington through its embassy in Pretoria is pursuing a regime-change agenda. Party spokesperson Zize Kodwa stated in March: ‚ÄúThey have taken about 45 young people to America to train them as part of their leadership program. What we got from those young people is not what they expected; they were trained on how to destabilize the country and regime change.‚Äù (Xinhua News Agency, March 16)";english;2016-11-22T22:57:36.416+02:00;globalresearch.ca;CA;19116.0;‚ÄúRegime Change‚Äù?

Earlier this year an announcement raised a tantalizing possibility: a ninth planet lurking in the outer reaches of our solar system. 
The announcement turned the astronomy and planetary science world upside down. 
Caltech astronomer Michael Brown and theoretical astrophysicist Konstantin Batygin found evidence for a possible 10 Earth mass planet that may be tilting long-orbiting dwarf planets on their sides and shepherding them into clusters far past the orbit of Neptune in highly eccentric orbits.

In June of 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) put forward a proposal to regulate the short-term loan industry. 
The Small Dollar Lending Rule seeks to ‚Äúalleviate and solve‚Äù for the ‚Äúapparent weaknesses‚Äù of the current rates and short-term lenders by requiring ‚Äúlenders to assess and verify a borrower‚Äôs income, housing costs, and credit and legal obligations.‚Äù 
The intention of the proposal is to protect low-income families from being caught in an endless cycle where many are ‚Äúforced to take out another loan to make ends meet.‚Äù At first glance, it seems that the rule would solve problems in an industry known for its ‚Äúdirtiness.‚Äù Except policymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their air-conditioned offices, away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of short-term loans. Just the fact that they see the short-term loan industry as ‚Äúdirty‚Äù supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative. 
Instead of pointing fingers and name calling at the short-term lending industry, they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water. 
In ‚ÄúUnderstanding the CFPB Proposal for Payday and Other Small Loans,‚Äù a paper released by the CFPB and PEW Charitable Trusts, the Bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation. 
The first of its arguments is that, ‚Äúwith payday and vehicle title loan markets, lenders‚Äô and borrowers‚Äô interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers.‚Äù But doesn‚Äôt this argument stand for any industry that sells a product? 
For example, are the interests of iPhone sellers and buyers ‚Äúaligned‚Äù in the manner acceptable to the CFPB? Each additional iPhone 6 is said to cost $200.10 to produce and is sold for $699 dollars. That is 3 times its cost to make. To borrow a phrase from the left, that‚Äôs ‚Äúprice-gouging‚Äù to the tune of 300 percent. Yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call Apple a company that cheats its customers. 
So why should short-term lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than Apple? Shouldn‚Äôt short-term lenders be able to charge interest rates that make-up for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to low-income borrowers? 
Studies show these lenders charge on average 15 percent, or $15 for every $100 loaned ‚Äî a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets. 
The second of the CFPB‚Äôs arguments is that to solve for ‚Äúballoon payments,‚Äù or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans, the CFPB would ‚Äúrequire that most products become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments.‚Äù 
The problem with this statement is that the Bureau completely ignores the reason why short-term loans are so available to borrowers ‚Äî it‚Äôs because short-term loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow. 
Simply put, the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow. Additionally, making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model, making short-term lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency. 
The third of the CFPB‚Äôs arguments is that their proposal would solve the ‚Äúproblems‚Äù related to ‚Äúprice gouge lending‚Äù by requiring ‚Äúlenders to evaluate borrowers‚Äô financial condition,‚Äù by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income, housing expenses, all outstanding debt, and child support. Meanwhile, the lender is required to obtain a national credit report, and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies. 
Remember: all of these government-imposed requirements cost the short-term lenders money. The cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates. The result would either lead short-term loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans. 
Lastly, the CFPB heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by The Pew Charitable Trusts‚Äô survey research that the ‚Äúvast majority of borrowers want ‚Ä¶ most products [to] become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments.‚Äù 
At first glance, it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation. Although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance (due to the risk of short-term loans), many of those ‚Äúsurveyed‚Äù actually sent in raving reviews in support of short-term loans. 
In fact, more than 98 percent of the 12,308 submissions to the Bureau‚Äôs ‚Äú Tell Your Story ‚Äù program ‚Äî where people sent in their experiences regarding short-term loans ‚Äî were positive and excessively thankful for these loans. 
These responses ranged from, ‚Äúthere are no other avenues out there that can lend money like [this],‚Äù to a simple ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù This study was personally conducted by the CFPB. Unsatisfied with the results, they hid it from the public‚Äôs view until a Freedom of Information Act request forced them to release it. 
This holding back of information demonstrates that the Bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help. Rather, they have a keen eye for policy symbolism, and the flash of ‚Äúfighting for the underdog‚Äù when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back. 
Policymakers continue the belief that short-term loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college, or they simply want to be perceived as ‚Äúsomeone who cares.‚Äù But we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals. We cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt. Instead, we need to look at the cold-hard facts: the numbers that the CFPB uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false. 
The Small Dollar Lending Rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back ‚Äî it will only hurt the people it claims it will help. Let Americans make decisions for themselves ‚Äî they‚Äôre smarter and more risk-averse than Washington insiders give them credit for.

Establishment politicians and press are outraged that Trump would question the integrity of their system. 
They say it undermines public trust in political institutions. 
Yet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections, who are shutting down election audit procedures, who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony. 
One such person is Texas Director of Elections, Keith Ingram. 
This story is specific to Texas, but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting. 
I went to the Texas Secretary of State offices to ask Mr. Ingram about specific procedural changes he has made in his 4 year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in August that would have gone into effect this November. 
With camera & mic in hand, we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the Director about the election. 
We were told to wait in the lobby and Mr. Ingram would be down. 
You can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with Infowars. 
The man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions. 
So much for transparency and candor. 
This unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law. 
What follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in Texas. 
But before we get to specifics about his actions & his connection to the Rose Law firm in Arkansas, there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide: 
‚Ä¢ Why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard? 
‚Ä¢ Why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers & officials? 
Burning The Paper Trail 
In August 2016, Ingram, Texas Director of Elections, attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming November 8 election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting. His office issued new rules that would: 
Eliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers. 
Eliminate printing of Early Voting Results tapes. 
Eliminate printing of ballot images for recounts. 
Fortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed, with a formal public hearing scheduled after the November election. 
State Senator Don Huffines said ‚ÄúThe state‚Äôs chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more real-time paper records and backups, not fewer‚Ä¶The comfort & convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters‚Äô confidence and election integrity.‚Äù 
But even though these procedures have been postponed, Ingram‚Äôs previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the November election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated. Here are some of the problems‚Ä¶ 
1) Waiver of laws requiring a Partial Manual Recount audit 
Ingram waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in 1% of the election precincts or 3 election precincts, whichever is greater. This was waived in all 254 counties the day after the March 2016 Primary. The timing is significant because during the primary there were 1,743 move votes than voters in Hill County in the Republican Primary. The margin of victory was 225 in Texas House District 8 that contains Hill County. In calling for a criminal investigation, Ingram noted that it appears ‚Äú6 or 7 voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times.‚Äù Yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures. 
2) Waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes 
Ingram‚Äôs waivers issued in 2014, 2015, and 2016, appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws 65.004, 65.014, 66.022, 66.023, 66.024 and the Judges Handbook. These rules require ‚Äì ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThree original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates‚Äù ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúOn completion of the vote count, the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct‚Äù with ‚Äútotal number of voters‚Äù, ‚Äútotal number of votes‚Äù with the presiding judge signing each of the 3 copies to certify. 
Ingram also issued waivers for requirements that a ‚Äúzero tape‚Äù be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a ‚Äútally tape‚Äù printed at the close of election. His letter states that ‚Äúthe process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day.‚Äù 
So expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections. And if a favored vendor can‚Äôt perform to the law, the law is waived. 
If proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state, instead of waived by Ingram, the Hill County issue of 1,743 more voters than votes would not have happened. The vendor in Hill County, ES&S eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying ‚ÄúAn audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning Early Voting or Election Day ballots‚Ä¶There are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error.‚Äù 
But the Director of Elections is waiving those ‚Äúestablished election protocols‚Äù. Ingram‚Äôs waver of legal requirements & his improvised solution of ‚Äúprinting a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day‚Äù opens the door for error and fraud. 
3) Ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts 
The Secretary of State Election Division claims that ‚Äúcast vote records‚Äù are equivalent to ‚Äúballot images‚Äù. As you can see, the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered. 
The Texas Constitution, Article 6 ‚Äì Suffrage, Section 4 says ‚ÄúIn all elections by the people, the vote shall be by ballot, and the Legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box.‚Äù 
Yet the machines by vendors Hart InterCivic and ES&S, certified by Ingram, do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and don‚Äôt provide other components of a legal Texas ballot. 
4) Ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion 
Texas Election Code, Sec 33.056 says a ‚Äúwatcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving.‚Äù 
Affidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in Dallas County (with official Poll Watcher signed forms) detail how they were ‚Äúrepeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the Dallas County Central Counting Station such as ballot scanning, vote transfer, ballot transfer, computer activities, ballot tabulation, and viewing the elections computer line printer.‚Äù They state that they were ‚Äúrepeatedly treated disrespectfully, obstructed and blatantly ignored‚Äù by the election officials, and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the Texas Secretary of State Elections office. 
Hostility to election monitors, like Ingram‚Äôs refusal to answer our questions, destroy the public‚Äôs confidence in the honesty of the process ‚Äî and rightfully so. 
Ingram‚Äôs Connections To Arkansas, Kutak Rock, Rose Law Firm & Hillary Clinton 
According to a public information request of Ingram‚Äôs Secretary of State personnel file, Ingram left private practice and moved to Little Rock Arkansas, taking a job with the law firm, Kutak Rock, LL. At Kutak Rock, he worked under the managing partner, Gordon Miller Wilbourn who had been a partner with Hillary Clinton, Vince Foster and Webster Hubbell at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas in the 1990‚Äôs. The Wilbourn family is a large donor to the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary Clinton campaign. 
Ingram left Kutak Rock to return to Texas when he was hired by Gov. Rick Perry‚Äôs appointment office in 2008 to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts, boards & commissions. 
Ingrams‚Äôs career moves are interesting. In just 10 months, his journey from private practice in Texas through Arkansas Clinton-cronies and back to Texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half. In 2012, Ingram, was promoted to Director of the Election Division in the Texas Secretary of State‚Äôs Office where his salary was still 40% less than private practice. 
Ingram‚Äôs determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big Clinton donors. 
Establishment Of Both Parties Don‚Äôt Appear To Want Election Integrity 
In one lawsuit contesting election results for Austin City Council, the County could not produce ANY ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount. Computer logs had multiple ‚Äúcorruption/invalid‚Äù errors. During discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in 10 of the 12 precincts forming the district. One precinct had 100% voter turnout, another was just 2 registered voters shy of 100% in spite of only 32% and 17% county-wide turnout in the general and runoff elections. 
The County Democrat Party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a Republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities. 
There are some positive developments, however. The Republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly Republican County and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by Governor Abbott‚Äôs office. 
State Senator Bob Hall said, ‚ÄúDue to an increasing number of complaints, it is time for the Texas Elections Division Office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that office‚Ä¶and instruct all Texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Voters, regardless of political affiliation, should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest, transparent elections. For example, Chambers County in Texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected. It‚Äôs time to remove Keith Ingram as Texas Director of Elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots.

Two months after being purged from the border town of Jarablus in northern Syria by a Turkish-led force ‚Äî and just days after being targeted by Turkish airstrikes near al-Bab ‚Äî Syrian Kurds now fear a ‚Äústab in the back‚Äù from Turkey‚Äôs military as plans for a U.S.-led push to clear ISIS fighters from Raqqa are carried out. 
‚ÄúIt is very important Raqqa is liberated,‚Äù a chief political leader of the main Syrian Kurdish party, the PYD, told Reuters . ‚ÄúBut one point which is bothering us is that, if we go toward Raqqa, we will be stabbed from the back.‚Äù 
At the end of August, Turkish forces took part in a U.S.-led operation to eject ISIS from the northern border of Syria. Once inside Syria, however, Turkish forces ‚Äî leading Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels ‚Äî took aim at Kurdish fighters in the town of Jarablus, which sent them scurrying across the Euphrates River in retreat. 
The issue here is that the U.S. claims to find the Kurds useful in the fight against ISIS. The Kurds, in fact, make up a significant portion of one of the primary U.S.-supplied rebel forces in the region. As Reuters explains : 
‚ÄúKurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed umbrella group, as it has seized large areas of territory from Islamic State, laying the ground for an assault on Raqqa. 
‚ÄúHowever, Turkey‚Äôs intervention in Syria in August in support of rebel groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner has complicated that equation, leading to clashes between them and Kurdish groups allied to the SDF.‚Äù 
The problem is one of trust. Turkey believes the Kurdish militants are aligned with the Kurdish PYD party, which the Turks believe is allied with Kurds within Turkey who‚Äôve been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades. 
So regardless of whether the U.S. finds the Kurds useful, Turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future. In fact, it‚Äôs taking a much more proactive stance than that. 
Last Thursday, in a campaign of airstrikes that were ‚Äúthe heaviest against the YPG since Turkey launched a military incursion into Syria,‚Äù Turkey targeted three Kurdish-controlled villages along the northern Syrian border. The Turkish military later confirmed it had carried out ‚Äú26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia‚Äù and ‚Äúhad killed between 160 and 200 combatants.‚Äù 
Turkey‚Äôs major concern is that Kurdish-controlled enclaves will physically unite, ‚Äúthereby creating a de facto Kurdish mini-state along the Turkish border.‚Äù As such, Turkey has warned Kurds to keep out of towns like Manjib, which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in Aleppo. 
This tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the U.S.-led operation to purge ISIS from Raqqa draws nearer. In any case, Turkish President Erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence , and the days of him obediently ‚Äî even if somewhat grudgingly ‚Äî bending to the U.S. will appear to be fading, as well. 
‚ÄúFrom now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door, we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin, we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us,‚Äù Erdogan said from his palace last week. ‚ÄúLet them go wherever until we find and destroy them. I am saying this very clearly: they will not have a single place to find peace abroad.‚Äù NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

Darius Shahtahmasebi | Anti Media - October 26, 2016 Comments 
Last week, the U.S. State Department acknowledged that al-Qaeda-linked terror group Jabhat al-Nusra is not a ‚Äúpriority‚Äù for the United States‚Äô efforts in Syria. 
One might ask, then: if al-Qaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? 
State Department spokesman John Kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma, stating: 
‚ÄúThe only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in Syria is Bashar al-Assad and his supporters . We recognize Al-Nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, I‚Äôve talked about this ad nauseam.‚Äù 
Largely missing from the American narrative of the Syrian conflict is that al-Nusra is shelling residential areas in Aleppo, where the government holds control of the majority of Aleppo‚Äôs citizens. In other parts of the world, these al-Qaeda-linked extremists are seen as the enemy, whereas in Syria, Western media will often refer to them as mere ‚Äúrebel‚Äù groups. 
The United States first officially used the term ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù on September 20, 2011, to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of September 11. The stated aim at the time was to defeat Islamic-linked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the U.S. government accused of supporting terrorism. 
In 2013, Obama stated : 
‚Äú We must define our effort not as a boundless ‚ÄòGlobal War on Terror,‚Äô but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.‚Äù 
The fact that a terror group ‚Äî one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the United States on American soil ‚Äî is not a priority of the United States State Department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is. 
This change in rhetoric, which is ultimately designed to push ulterior economic agendas in the Middle East, is an insult to the thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their lives under the false pretense that they were going to protect their families from al-Qaeda-linked terrorists.

TO MANY WHO conduct work or research related to digital security, the legislation meant to protect against computer crimes has morphed into something harmful. The 1986 law, the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, has been repeatedly described as vague and ineffectual ‚Äî allowing overzealous prosecutors to saddle hacktivists and low-level criminals with excessive sentences. 
Now, thanks to a legal challenge to the CFAA, the Department of Justice is for the first time releasing its 2014 guidelines on how prosecutors should charge computer crimes ‚Äî when someone exceeds ‚Äúauthorized‚Äù access on a computer. (First Look Media, the publisher of The Intercept, is a plaintiff in the case.) 
The Department of Justice acknowledges that ‚Äúlaws addressing the misuse of computers have not kept pace uniformly with developments in technology and criminal schemes‚Äù though it maintains that the law remains ‚Äúimportant‚Äù in prosecuting cybercrimes. 
Some of the prosecutions under the CFAA have proved controversial.

The federal government is trying to recoup enlistment bonuses given erroneously to thousands of California soldiers despite routinely allowing poor-performing VA employees to keep their bonus checks. 
The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Pentagon demanded that thousands of California soldiers repay bonuses they were given to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department asked the soldiers to repay the bonuses, which amounted to $15,000 or more each, after audits revealed they were overpaid by the California National Guard. 
But the practice stands in contrast with that of the Obama administration‚Äôs Department of Veterans Affairs, which has failed to take back hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to high-ranking bureaucrats who have been scrutinized for bad behavior or poor management. 
For instance, the VA said last year it would not collect over $400,000 in bonuses paid to two senior executives who manipulated the agency‚Äôs hiring system to take new jobs with less responsibility and receive relocation benefits. The VA, which acknowledged that the employees abused the system, said it did not have the legal authority to recoup the money.";english;2016-10-26T23:12:59.857+03:00;infowars.com;US;2774.0;Obama Admin Targets Soldiers‚Äô Bonuses, Lets Bad VA Employees Keep Theirs;0.0;http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Obama-1.jpg;0;1;75;0;75;conspiracy

Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered the Pentagon on Wednesday to stop clawing back excessive recruiting bonuses paid to California National Guardsmen. 
The move came after news broke over the weekend that the Pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to California Guardsmen. Some of the payments were made by mistake, others were taken fraudulently. 
‚ÄúWhile some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not,‚Äù Carter said in a statement. ‚ÄúAbout 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments.‚Äù 
As first reported by the Los Angeles Times , the Pentagon sought repayment of the excess bonuses from almost 10,000 California Guard soldiers.

Some had had their wages garnished and tax liens slapped on them when they refused to pay.

CNN‚Äôs CAROL COSTELLO: ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?‚Äù JONATHAN GRUBER: ‚ÄúLook, once again, there‚Äôs no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty‚Äú‚Ä¶ Gruber‚Äôs arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. ‚ÄúObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,‚Äù points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn‚Äôt come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool ‚Äústupid‚Äù Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law‚Äôs ‚Äúlack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage‚Äù in selling it.

China‚Äôs debt growth rate has become the focus of some discussions and, fair enough, from comparing the outright levels, it may seem that China can collapse at any moment. 
Daniel Fernandez suggested this in his article ‚Äú Has China Reached Its Debt Limit? ‚Äù in Mises Wire . In response to the government‚Äôs monetary expansion stimulus plan after the 2008 financial crisis, China‚Äôs corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly, followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector. However, in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges, we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective. Using the same data source as used by Fernandez, we find that China‚Äôs total debt as a percentage of GDP was 254 percent by the end of 2015. Debt-to-GDP ratio of corporate, government, and household sectors stood at 170 percent, 44 percent, and 40 percent respectively. 
For government and household sectors, both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a four-trillion yuan (RMB) stimulus plan in 2009. Government debt-to-GDP ratio, which was kept in the mid 30s in the first decade of this millennium, now stood at 44 percent by the end of 2015. Household‚Äôs debt-to-GDP ratio was at 11 percent in 2006 and almost doubled to 19 percent in 2007 and then doubled again to 40 percent by the end of 2015. The leveraging up of households happened exactly as the Chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its 2009 stimulus. 
Apart from the demand for urban housing, Chinese households, with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands, invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation. Furthermore, as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending, household debt increased dramatically. However, we must note that although the debt growth rate was high, the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers. 
The most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector, with the debt-to-GDP ratio increased from approximately 110 percent prior to 2009 to 170 percent by the end of 2015. First of all, the level of corporate debt (mostly in the form of bank loans) was high to start with, but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector, whose funding source is mostly deposits. Two figures from Jonathan Anderson‚Äôs How To Think About China series provide some insights: 1 
An international comparison of assets of banking system vs. domestic saving rate: 
Breakdown of assets of China‚Äôs financial system: 
This point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures, for example, between the US and China. Obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in China, whereas in the US the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets, where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily. 
Financial asset structure: US vs. China (2015): 
Data source: The World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, China Central Deposit and Clearing, Co. Ltd. (CCDC), SIFMA 
It is, therefore, not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to government‚Äôs stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system. China‚Äôs Flat Yield Curve 
The large role of the banks can also be seen in China‚Äôs bond market yields, and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve . The reason for this is simple: deposits. When banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out, they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields. This investment strategy (or asset-liability management scheme) bids up the bond prices on the long end, hence pushing down the long-term yields. 
In addition, between allocating deposits to these two types of assets (bonds vs. loans), banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds, rather than lending, due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand, credit risks, market liquidity, and yields (that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early 2016). So the yield spread, at current stage, reflects more of the combination of China‚Äôs financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals. As the government flooded the market with four trillion RMB from the stimulus plan in 2009, bond yields faced downward pressure, more so at the long-term end. Please see the yields of Chinese government treasury bonds at maturity (10 years vs. 1 year) and the spread thereof in the below figure. Wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of banking-sector supervision (in form of trusts, for example), but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner. 
Data source: WIND, CCDC 
China didn‚Äôt open up to the outside world until the very late 1970s. Now China provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around 6 percent. Obviously a good part of China‚Äôs production structure has been configured to export, mostly to the developed economies, which are dominated by the service sector. As the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum, China faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers (which stands at 4 times the number of US consumers). This reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities. But to me, this is more of a textbook case of Austrian economics at work. Capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market. And this takes time. Moreover, quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity, with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than 30 years ago, so that Chinese consumers don‚Äôt have to go to Japan to buy hi-tech toilet lids . A Healthier Skepticism of ‚ÄúStimulus‚Äù 
Needless to say, the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue. Ultimately, whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post 2008 stimulus phase is a function of how fast the Chinese government runs the money printing press. A recent article on the People‚Äôs Daily ‚Äî the mouthpiece of China Communist Party (CCP) ‚Äî quoted the diagnosis from an ‚Äúauthoritative figure‚Äù on the Chinese economy and its cure. This ‚Äúauthoritative figure‚Äù suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the Chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate (comparing with its own historical average of 10 percent). Anyone with an understanding of China‚Äôs political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of Chinese leadership. This can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years. 
The Xinhua News Agency, the mainstream media group, recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth. Xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed. Messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world. How China‚Äôs policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen, but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media. In addition, a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced, and the central government is pushing hard for business-friendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom. 
China has its problems; tons of them. China may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises, as many people say. No matter whichever the case, I am more convinced that China will be among the first ones to revive ‚Äî because it has high savings to invest, it has a well-trained labor force with one of the most vibrant, if not the most complete, manufacturing chain, and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over 40 percent of its GDP. It is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process. It is not yet a welfare state. Chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises. China has the biggest potential market of 1.3 billion people with a rising middle-class that is still increasing in numbers and share in population. Serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the 21st century.

Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let‚Äôs hope that it doesn‚Äôt happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. 
If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned ‚Äúabout the possibility of violence‚Äù on election day‚Ä¶ 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are ‚Äúvery concerned.‚Äù Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are ‚Äúvery confident‚Äù about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won‚Äôt recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn‚Äôt have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump‚Äôs star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax‚Ä¶ 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump‚Äôs star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump‚Äôs star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June ‚Ä¶ 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate‚Äôs star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump‚Äôs star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump‚Äôs star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted ‚ÄúNazi Republicans get out of town or else‚Äù along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece‚Ä¶ 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?‚Äù 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. ‚ÄúThe two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‚Äòsome thugs‚Äô that a barmaid called out from the back.‚Äù Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a ‚ÄúBlue Lives Matter‚Äù shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let‚Äôs certainly hope that we don‚Äôt see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is ‚Äúgrabbing my musket‚Äù if Donald Trump loses the election‚Ä¶ 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, ‚ÄúOn November 8th, I‚Äôm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I‚Äôm grabbing my musket. You in?‚Äù 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today ‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúSince the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I‚Äôve been buying a lot more ammunition,‚Äù says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan‚Äôs Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to ‚Äúdeclare martial law and take our guns away‚Äù after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month ‚Ä¶ 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.

Won‚Äôt you take pity on this poor, innocent little child? 
This image of a ‚Äú16-year-old‚Äù migrant crying ‚Äì which is currently plastered on the front page of The Guardian ‚Äì is nothing short of laughable. 
‚ÄúA 16-year-old from Ethiopia cries while he awaits registration at a processing centre in the makeshift refugee camp near Calais,‚Äù the photo‚Äôs caption reads. The image is placed under a headline reading: ‚ÄúCouncils resist pressure to take children from Calais.‚Äù 
This crying ‚Äúchild‚Äù is supposed to make Brits feel guilty and demand their government allow ‚Äúchildren‚Äù like him into their nation. 
The image is not a fake, nor is it being used satirically. It comes from the Associated Press‚Äô Emilio Morenatti , you can see four pictures of the man for sale on their website . 
The ‚Äúchild migrant‚Äù is clearly in his 40‚Äôs, yet their editors evidently believe their readers are so incredibly stupid they‚Äôll actually believe they‚Äôre looking at a 16-year-old boy.

GOP nominee Donald Trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule Wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel, prompting one CNN reporter to accuse Trump of ‚Äútaking time out of swing states.‚Äù Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is again nowhere to be seen. 
CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash suggested that Trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states, yet Trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day. Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: ‚ÄúNo, not at all‚Äù https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
‚Äî CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
‚ÄúSo to people who say you‚Äôre taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?‚Äù Bash asked. 
‚ÄúI say the following: You have been covering me for the last ‚Äî long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I‚Äôve been doing this for weeks straight,‚Äù Trump responded. 
‚ÄúFor you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you‚Äôll ask me that question. I think that‚Äôs a very rude question, to be honest with you.‚Äù Trump exclaimed. 
Trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. 
While CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. 
Last month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. 
And in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. 
‚ÄúHer speeches are so short ‚Äì they don‚Äôt last long, they‚Äôre like 10 minutes and ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get out of here,‚Äô‚Äù Donald Trump said about her schedule. ‚ÄúGo back home and go to sleep.‚Äù NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

GOP Nominee Donald Trump, who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him, shot out a tweet Thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines ‚Äòflipping‚Äô to register votes for Hillary Clinton, when voters choose Trump. 
‚ÄúA lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas,‚Äù Trump tweeted. 
‚ÄúPeople are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?‚Äù A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on? 
‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016 
As Infowars has highlighted , there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. 
While election officials have dismissed the reports, suggesting ‚Äòuser error‚Äô is to blame, tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time. 
Larry Norden, a voting technology expert, told NPR that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed. 
‚ÄúOver time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate,‚Äù Norden noted. 
During elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines ‚Äòflipping‚Äô. Indeed, the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as The Simpsons drew attention to it: 
Meanwhile, The Washington Post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression, bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòrigged‚Äô election claims. 
Callum Borchers, author at the Washington Post blog The Fix writes: Since the final presidential debate last week, many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to Donald Trump supporters: Your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election Nov. 8. A day later, the Times‚Äôs Upshot blog increased Clinton‚Äôs chances of winning to 93 percent , an all-time high. On Monday, Politico‚Äôs Ben Schreckinger wrote that ‚Äú Donald Trump‚Äôs path to an election night win is almost entirely closed .‚Äù Here at The Fix, Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote that ‚Äú Donald Trump‚Äôs chances of winning are approaching zero .‚Äù These are accurate, statistically sound statements. But they are something else, too. Declarations that Trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the Republican nominee‚Äôs warning that the ‚Äúrigged‚Äù election could be ‚Äú stolen from us .‚Äù 
The latest polls, which Trump insists are rigged due to oversampling, show Clinton with a double digit lead. 
However, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager Robby Mook has warned that Trump‚Äôs suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are ‚Äúabsolutely right.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day.‚Äù Mook said, urging Clinton supporters to vote. 
‚ÄúMake no mistake. With only 10 percent of votes cast, Donald Trump could win this election,‚Äù Mook said.

For the first time in centuries, scientists have exposed the original surface of what is traditionally considered the tomb of Jesus Christ. Located in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, the tomb has been covered by marble cladding since at least 1555 A.D., and most likely centuries earlier. 
‚ÄúThe marble covering of the tomb has been pulled back, and we were surprised by the amount of fill material beneath it,‚Äù said Fredrik Hiebert, archaeologist-in-residence at the National Geographic Society, a partner in the restoration project. ‚ÄúIt will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of Christ was laid.‚Äù

A new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . 
The survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. 
The findings represent a four-point increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an all-time high for the past three decades. 
The poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are ‚Äúagainst‚Äù a ban on semi-automatic rifles, or ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äùas the corporate media refers to them. 
That figure represents a full ten-point increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. 
Just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semi-automatic ban. an eight-point decline on previous findings. 
In addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. 
In a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a ‚Äúparadox‚Äù: 
Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. 
The findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clinton‚Äôs position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. 
Hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. 
Clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankrupt‚Äìand eventually end‚Äìgun manufacturing in the United States.

China has experienced such a growth rate of HIV in the past several years that one university has taken steps to allow students to test themselves: by placing an HIV testing kit in a vending machine next to regular fare like snacks. 
China has seen a 43% year-over-year increase in infection rates, which likely prompted Southwest Petroleum University in Nanchong City in Sichuan Province to install the test kits . 
Sichuan Province is one of the top three provinces in China with a disproportionately high rate of HIV/AIDS. Together, with the other two provinces that have high rates of the disease, the three account for over half of the cases of HIV/AIDS in the entire country. 
80% of new HIV cases occur due to homosexual activity. 
The kits retail for $4.40 and can be taken as a urine test to determine whether or not students need to seek medical attention. Those who purchase the test will collect their urine and send it to a laboratory, and then access the results online. This can all be done completely anonymously. 
Similar kits can be purchased online, but they retail for around $45. The cheaper vending machine tests are just as accurate and are partially subsidized by a charity to allow the test to be more accessible. 
Reports state that the Chinese have limited sex education and very little is discussed about HIV or AIDS. Many students who suspect they may have the disease do not seek medical help because of its link to homosexuality. Those who do have HIV are often thought to be pariahs by their families and friends because of its connection with same-sex encounters. 
The disease is mostly spreading amongst young homosexual men, but as with anywhere else, women who do not use proper protection are also susceptible to becoming infected. 
Doctors have stated that most young people who have become infected with HIV/AIDS in China lacked proper education and did not take appropriate precautions for prevention.

In the wake of the final presidential election debate last week, the mainstream media was appalled that Donald Trump would not pre-emptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election . 
Trump‚Äôs position reflects a growing faction of Americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the American electoral system. In response, mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that ‚Äúrigged‚Äù elections are ‚Äú a myth .‚Äù 
While rarely stated explicitly, the way American electoral politics is supposed to work is this: the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes, horrible ideas, and gross incompetence. Each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winner‚Äôs policy preferences on the losers. Then, once the votes are cast, everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results, ignore everything that was said during the campaign, and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone, including the sizable minority ‚Äî or even the majority, in many cases ‚Äî who either voted against the winner, or abstained. If there appears to be any ‚Äúirregularities‚Äù in the vote, well, those should just be ignored because it would ‚Äútear the country apart‚Äù to ‚Äúdrag out‚Äù the election. If half the country feels it‚Äôs been cheated, well, tough luck and better luck next time. Democracy Breaks Down As (Perceived) Interventionism Increases 
This model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions. It can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power, and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare. It can also work in a small, culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socio-economic and ethnic groups. 
In the case of the United States, however, it appears that neither of these conditions apply. 
In the age of presidential executive orders, militarized police, uncountable federal laws, and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch Americans‚Äô every move, gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question. The president says he can issue laws with ‚Äú a pen and ‚Ä¶ a phone ‚Äù without any need to consult Congress. The Libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in Congress. Meanwhile, the untouchable Supreme Court hands down decisions that are equivalent to Constitutional amendments, some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens. 
In other words, the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of ‚Äúbetter luck next time‚Äù doesn‚Äôt cut it. Whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant. The fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing. 
This situation is further complicated by the fact that the United States is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socio-economic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography. Many of these different groups distrust each other, and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation, there is reason to be fearful when ‚Äúthe other guy‚Äôs‚Äù candidate wins and yours loses. Democracy Can Work When the Stakes Are Low 
Contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives, the United States was never united into a single cultural, linguistic, or socio-economic group. Those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century, but they were far larger in the 19th century than they are today. 
When you have a diverse population, however, the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important, and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful. Writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in Australia , Ludwig von Mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides. Could a laissez-faire regime be guaranteed to all residents of Australia, Mises notes, it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between English-descended Australians and Asian newcomers. However, since laissez-faire liberalism has not been embraced, a familiar problem presented itself: 
The present inhabitants of [Australia] fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which, for instance, the Germans are today [i.e., the early 1920s] exposed in Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Poland. 
It cannot be denied that these fears are justified. Because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state, a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality. As long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right, the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying. It is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution ‚Äî masquerading under the guise of justice ‚Äî by a ruling majority. It is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of one‚Äôs nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority‚Ä¶ 
It is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state, which meddles in every field of human activity, or to that of the socialist state. Only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration, which today seems insoluble, completely disappear. In an Australia governed according to liberal principles, what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent Japanese and in other parts Englishmen were in the majority? 
These same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well. The existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group, with the help of state power. Change the term ‚Äúnationality‚Äù to ‚Äúpolitical party‚Äù or ‚Äúinterest groups,‚Äù and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state. 
In the presence of a relatively weak government, however, these concerns are often overstated. At the turn of the 20th century in the US, for example, the fact that Spanish-speakers were in the majority in New Mexico and many areas of the American West was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of Americans. The fact that Japanese immigrants and their descendant were out-competing white businessmen in California was simply not a matter of national importance. The fact that Oregon attempted to outlaw Catholic Schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders. Thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time, the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard. 
Voters have always feared losses in elections, but now more than ever, the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under ‚Äúan interventionist state, which meddles in every field of human activity.‚Äù When that is the case, elections are not something to be taken lightly. Trump‚Äôs remarks about rigged elections ‚Äî and public fears over the outcome ‚Äî are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of out-of-control state power. 
In response to all of this, the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy, and that elections ‚Äî specifically federal ones ‚Äîare sacred rituals never to be questioned. There will be a double standard, of course. A Trump victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians. But, in that case it will be the fault of the Russians , and not anything wrong with the system itself. The solution for the feds, of course, will be a federal takeover of the election system. If Clinton wins, then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all. To question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege. 
The true solution to the problem remains far more practical, however. To paraphrase Mises, it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state. So long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side, faith in the electoral system will erode, and the potential for real violence will increase.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens, has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its 2015 report on ‚Äúprobably carcinogenic‚Äù glyphosate. 
The IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review, according to Reuters. The agency told Reuters on Tuesday that it tried to protect the study from ‚Äúexternal interference,‚Äù as well as protect its intellectual rights, since it was ‚Äúthe sole owner of such materials.‚Äù 
The scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the 2015 report under US freedom of information laws. 
The groundbreaking review, published in March 2015 by the IARC ‚Äì a semi-autonomous agency of the World Health Organization (WHO) ‚Äì labeled the glyphosate herbicide as ‚Äúprobably carcinogenic to humans.‚Äù Glyphosate is a key ingredient of Monsanto‚Äôs flagship weedkiller well-known under the trade name ‚ÄòRoundup.‚Äô It is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with genetically-modified ‚ÄúRoundup Ready‚Äù crops, also produced by Monsanto. 
The IARC‚Äôs report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself. 
The report sparked a heated debate around the use of Roundup, and caused several EU countries ‚Äì including France, Sweden, and the Netherlands ‚Äì to object to the renewal of the glyphosate‚Äôs EU license. The vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for 15 years failed several times in June 2016, but the license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration. 
The controversial report has seemingly made the IARC a target for attacks from multiple directions, and raised scientific, legal, and financial questions. 
Various critics, including those in the chemical industry, said the IARC‚Äôs evaluations are fuel for ‚Äúunnecessary health scares,‚Äù since the IARC allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself, and not a ‚Äútypical human‚Äù exposure to it. It remained unclear whether the critics urged a WHO body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans. 
The critics also brought up other controversial statements from the IARC, over whether such things as mobile phones, coffee, red meat, and processed meat could cause cancer. 
The agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and ‚Äúwidely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and‚Ä¶freedom from conflicts of interest.‚Äù Numerous freedom of information requests by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal), a US conservative advocacy group, have since been turned down with this reasoning. 
E&E Legal told Reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the IARC or to the US federal and state institutions where some of the experts work. Basically, it‚Äôs being decided whether the IARC, as part of the WHO, is truly independent and free from ‚Äúconflicts of interest.‚Äù 
According to Reuters, officials from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be questioned by a congressional committee about why American taxpayers fund the cancer agency, which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens. 
‚ÄúIARC‚Äôs standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm,‚Äù a letter from US Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to NIH director Francis Collins states, as quoted by Reuters. 
The Oversight Committee demanded a full disclosure of NIH funding of the IARC, and even money spent in relation to the cancer agency‚Äôs activities. 
IARC opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which believes glyphosate is ‚Äúunlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans,‚Äù promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its ‚Äúcommitment to open risk assessment.‚Äù The food safety watchdog made this statement in late September, and still has to deliver the promised information.

Dementia is one of the most common and debilitating illnesses that older Americans face today. 
However, recent studies have suggested that air pollution may be one of the top causes for the contribution of the disease‚Äôs growth. 
By 2050, 1 in 4 Americans will suffer from Alzheimer‚Äôs. Alzheimer‚Äôs is the most potent form of dementia, and often ends in the patient unable to remember how to do daily and necessary tasks like eating or using the restroom. This will rival the current diabetes and obesity crises seen today. 
Recent studies have confirmed that a variety of environmental factors are at play when it comes to dementia. 
Doctors have noted that those who are deficient in vitamin D are 125% more likely to develop dementia than those who get in the necessary amount. 
A vitamin D deficiency can also be associated with brittle or soft bones as well as depression. It is recommended that everyone gets at least 10 minutes of sunlight per day in order to ensure they have enough vitamin D, as well as eat fortified dairy products or salmon, liver and red meat. Vitamin D can also be obtained through supplementation or fish oil. 
However, doctors have found that the biggest environmental risk for dementia lies in air pollution. 
In fact, the problem is so great that those who live in a city with high pollution can double their risk of develop dementia within 1 or 2 months living there. 
Recent studies have also shown that post-mortem examinations of the brains of those who have lived in highly polluted areas contain traces of magnetite. This chemical compound may be partially responsible for the memory impairments associated with dementia. 
The risk of developing dementia if you are exposed to air pollution increases exponentially if you are obese. 
Researchers say that those concerned about the epidemic can combat it by living somewhere with as little pollution as possible, maintaining a health intake of vitamin D and exercising. 
According to research, exercise is imperitive when it comes to staving off the illness. Dr. Laura Baker, who ran a study on dementia and exercise stated: 
‚ÄúThese findings are important because they strongly suggest a potent lifestyle intervention such as aerobic exercise can impact Alzheimer‚Äôs-related changes in the brain. No currently approved medication can rival these effects.‚Äù NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

During the height of the Cold War, the CIA attempted to develop mind control techniques with the MKULTRA program. 
As it happens, the Communists already had a leg up on them. We‚Äôll explore how this was done, along with some new twists. 
The criticism and self-criticism technique in history 
The technique of ‚Äúcriticism and self-criticism‚Äù (kritika i samokritika) was developed during the early days of the Soviet Union. This got results. When the early Soviet show trials and purges took place, the targets would confess to committing treason‚Äîthe details stretching credulity‚Äîand beg for execution. The Maoists (Chinese Communists) used it too, typically during ‚Äústruggle sessions.‚Äù Also, forced confessions were required in Vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps. 
What happened wasn‚Äôt much different from a medieval inquisition. Those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did. Of course, physical forms of coercion were also an option.

The recent Wikileaks revelations about the Clintons, the Clinton campaign, media collusion, and the various hypocrisies of the Democratic Party are groundbreaking in both their scope and depth. 
The sheer number of hacked emails covering so many topics, combined with the shadiness of the activities involved, should have already handed Donald Trump the election. 
Alas, the media, whose collusion with the Clinton campaign is laid out in many of the emails, will not have a bar of reporting them in a professional, ethical fashion. The following seven email exchanges have either been deliberately suppressed by mainstream outlets or given the slimmest coverage to feebly ward off accusations that they are in the de facto service (or pocket) of Hillary Clinton.

Julian Assange has claimed the Hillary Clinton campaign has attacked the servers being used by WikiLeaks. 
Despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down his internet until the US election is over, the website will continue publishing, according to Assange. 
‚ÄúEveryday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict,‚Äù Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. 
The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton‚Äôs campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October. 
Assange claimed the release ‚Äúwhipped up a crazed hornet‚Äôs nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign‚Äù leading them to attack WikiLeaks. 
‚Äú They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,‚Äù he added. 
Ecuador‚Äôs decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a ‚Äústrategic position‚Äù so that its ‚Äúpolicy of non-intervention can‚Äôt be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.‚Äù 
He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month. 
Assange, who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference, said he did not agree with Ecuador‚Äôs decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. 
He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, ‚Äúthis is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process ‚Äì for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform.‚Äù 
He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being ‚Äúcontrolled by Clinton supporters.‚Äù 
The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton,‚Äù he said. 
Assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing ‚Äúwhat in their mind is white trash.‚Äù NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

In another example of poll rigging, an ABC presidential poll surveyed 9% more Democrats than Republicans and showed Hillary Clinton leading by 12% ‚Äì with a 3% sampling error! 
ABC claims it‚Äôs a ‚Äú12-point race‚Äù with Clinton ahead after polling a ‚Äúrandom‚Äù national sample of 1,155 likely voters, but the poll‚Äôs methodology reveals the poll was heavily biased in favor of Hillary. 
‚ÄúResults have a margin of sampling error of 3 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 36-27-31 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents,‚Äù ABC said near the bottom of the poll. 
Of course Hillary will be ahead in polls dominated by Democrats, but ABC and other mainstream media outlets are betting that voters won‚Äôt bother to look at a poll‚Äôs methodology to find the bias. 
Even if there‚Äôs more registered Democrats than Republicans nationally, they don‚Äôt outnumber them by nearly 10% because otherwise Republicans wouldn‚Äôt be winning national races. 
‚ÄúThese kind of misleading polls really strike at their credibility as pollsters,‚Äù wrote media analyst Aaron Rossiter. ‚ÄúThey seem to want the big Hillary lead, probably to throw off the poll averages and suppress Republican voter turnout.‚Äù 
And if the fact that mainstream polls are ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù to manufacture a Hillary lead still sounds doubtful to you, just read this leaked email from Democratic consultant Tom Matzzie: 
‚ÄúI also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in February. By market, regions, etc. I want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what we get out of our media polling.‚Äù 
The email also includes this report from The Atlas Project on how to rig polls to get the desired result: 
For example, in Florida, a key battleground state, Democratic consultants recommended oversampling African-American and Hispanic voters who lean Democratic so the polls favor Democrat candidates: 
‚Äì General election benchmark, 800 sample, with potential over samples in key districts/regions

Scientists are planning to release an army of millions of modified mosquitoes in areas of Brazil and Colombia.

A new ‚Äòscorecard‚Äô report gives a failing grade to 17 out of 20 major food retailers in the United States, based on their policies and practices regarding pollinator protection, organic options, and pesticide reduction. [1] Source: Friends of the Earth 
Tiffany Finck-Haynes, food futures campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: 
‚ÄúU.S. food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis. 
The majority of the food sold at top U.S. food retailers is produced with pollinator-toxic pesticides. We urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinator-toxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators, people and the planet.‚Äù [1] Organic Offerings And Transparency Are Lacking 
The report ‚ÄúSwarming the Aisles: Rating Top Retailers on Bee-Friendly and Organic Food‚Äù is the work of a coalition led by Friends of the Earth and more than 50 farmer, beekeeper, farmworker, environmental, and public interest organizations. [1] 
The coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators , and increase U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified organic food and beverages to 15% of overall offerings by 2025. The group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic, regional, and local p¬≠roducers. 
Friends of the Earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than 65 garden retailers, including Lowe‚Äôs and Home Depot, to commit to eliminate pollinator-toxic neonicotinoid (neonic) pesticides. 
According to Haynes, the demand for organic foods has grown by double-digits , but grocers aren‚Äôt keeping up. She said: 
‚ÄúA lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings, but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future.‚Äù [2] 
As evidenced by the group‚Äôs research, it‚Äôs difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food. Eleven of the 20 retailers‚Äô websites examined by Friends of the Earth don‚Äôt provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food, pollinators, and/or pesticides , Haynes said, adding: 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings, and then be able to sell that in their stores.‚Äù Americans Are Ready For Change 
A YouGov poll released 25 October 2016 by Friends of the Earth and SumOfUs reveals that 80% of Americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture , and 65% of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids. [1] 
Additionally, the poll shows that 59% of respondents believe it‚Äôs important for supermarkets to sell organic food. Another 43% said they‚Äôd likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent. 
Said Angus Wong, lead campaign strategist at SumOfUs, a consumer watchdog with ten million members: 
‚ÄúOver 750,000 SumOfUs members have spoken out advocating that U.S. Hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators. And after years of pressure, Home Depot and Lowe‚Äôs have finally enacted more bee-friendly policies. 
And the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too. This is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately.‚Äù 
Only four of the nation‚Äôs top food retailers ‚Äì Albertsons, Costco, Target, and Whole Foods ‚Äì have adopted and made public a company-wide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food . They are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer, or organic sales. 
Aldi, Food Lion, part of the Delhaize Group, and Kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales. 
None of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from American farmers . Retailer Apathy Is Killing Pollinators 
Of the top 20 food retailers surveyed by Friends of the Earth, a shocking 16 were predominantly unresponsive to Friends of the Earth‚Äôs requests for information via surveys, calls, and letters. The group was forced to turn to publicly available information, including company websites, company annual reports, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports, press coverage, and industry analyses, for their data. 
We have bees to thank for every 1 in 3 bites of food we take ; and without bees, stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds. Source: Bee Cause 
Science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline. Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto‚Äôs blockbuster herbicide, Roundup, has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines . 
Several U.S. cities have banned neonics, including Boulder City, Colorado , and Portland, Oregon . This past spring, Maryland became the first state to ban the pesticides .

Eddington | The Intercept - October 27, 2016 Comments 
DO THE COMMITTEES that oversee the vast U.S. spying apparatus take intelligence community whistleblowers seriously? Do they earnestly investigate reports of waste, fraud, abuse, professional negligence, or crimes against the Constitution reported by employees or contractors working for agencies like the CIA or NSA? For the last 20 years, the answer has been a resounding ‚Äúno.‚Äù 
My own experience in 1995-96 is illustrative. Over a two-year period working with my wife, Robin (who was a CIA detailee to a Senate committee at the time), we discovered that, contrary to the public statements by then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell and other senior George H. W. Bush administration officials (including CIA Director John Deutch), American troops had in fact been exposed to chemical agents during and after the 1991 war with Saddam Hussein. While the Senate Banking Committee under then-Chairman Don Riegle, D-Mich., was trying to uncover the truth of this, officials at the Pentagon and CIA were working to bury it. 
At the CIA, I objected internally ‚Äî and was immediately placed under investigation by the CIA‚Äôs Office of Security. That became clear just days after we delivered the first of our several internal briefings to increasingly senior officials at the CIA and other intelligence agencies. In February 1995, I received a phone call from CIA Security asking whether I‚Äôd had any contacts with the media. I had not, but I had mentioned to CIA officials we‚Äôd met with that I knew that the CBS newsmagazine ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù was working on a piece about the Gulf War chemical cover-up. This call would not be the last I‚Äôd receive from CIA Security about the matter, nor the only action the agency would take against us. 
In the spring of 1995, a former manager of Robin‚Äôs discreetly pulled her aside and said that CIA Security agents were asking questions about us, talking to every single person with or for whom either of us had worked. I seemed to be the special focus of their attention, and the last question they asked our friends, colleagues, and former managers was, ‚ÄúDo you believe Pat Eddington would allow his conscience to override the secrecy agreement he signed?‚Äù";english;2016-10-28T05:10:09.820+03:00;infowars.com;US;2774.0;When CIA and NSA Workers Blow the Whistle, Congress Plays Deaf;0.0;http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1-13-16-cia.jpg;0;1;63;0;63;conspiracy

Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? 
All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , ‚Äúvoting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.‚Äù Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News ‚Ä¶ 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
‚ÄúIf anybody can sit there and say they don‚Äôt think this is a contentious election, then they aren‚Äôt paying much attention,‚Äù Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are ‚Äúsoft targets‚Äù that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters ‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúThere is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn‚Äôt have 15 or 20 years ago,‚Äù said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. ‚Äú What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that‚Äôs certainly concerning.‚Äù 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania ‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to lose an election because you know what I‚Äôm talking about,‚Äù Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. ‚ÄúBecause you know what? That‚Äôs a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .‚Äù 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats‚Ä¶ 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
‚ÄúI tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,‚Äù Moynihan said. ‚ÄúYou could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.‚Äù 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation ‚Ä¶ 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation ‚Äì apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 ‚Äì when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesn‚Äôt look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats don‚Äôt like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,‚Äù Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book ‚Äú Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,‚Äù previously told The Christian Science Monitor. ‚ÄúVoting was very, very dangerous. I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs suggesting that we‚Äôre at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.‚Äù 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

CNN anchor Hala Gorani wasn‚Äôt expecting her network to be called the ‚ÄúClinton News Network‚Äù by British firebrand conservative columnist Katie Hopkins from The Daily Mail and watching the ensuing implosion is a must-see. 
Hopkins‚Äô first offense was daring to believe Donald Trump is going to win the election ‚Äî never a good way to start on CNN: 
‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs going to win. I think you guys are in for a big surprise, which I‚Äôm quite excited about. I think we‚Äôve seen a very similar think here in the UK with Brexit.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs CNN. You‚Äôre calling us the Clinton News Network?‚Äù Gorani said in shock. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exactly correct,‚Äù Hopkins said. 
The two argued over how the media are obsessed with polls, especially the ones showing Hillary Clinton in the lead. Hopkins destroyed Gorani saying, ‚ÄúHaving sat in the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and watched your news network, it is entirely biased, I think, in coverage.‚Äù 
Gorani refused to believe and said over her 18-year career at CNN, she‚Äôs only seen ‚Äúnothing but balance‚Äù at the network.

Powerful video shows a homeless woman protecting Donald Trump‚Äôs Walk of Fame Star after it was smashed by a criminal leftist. 
As The Gateway Pundit reports , the woman was seen holding up a sign reading: ‚Äú20 Million Illegals and Americans Sleep on the Streets in Tents. Vote Trump.‚Äù 
It was repaired on the same day. 
The day after, this homeless Trump supporter went to protect it.

Video shared on Periscope shows hordes of disgusting leftists insult and attack the woman for supporting Trump. 
In this short video posted to YouTube, one angry black man is seen screaming in her face and asking her: ‚ÄúDo you know your federal government is not even party of the f***ing government?‚Äù 
‚ÄúDo you know that?‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt think so,‚Äù he says. 
‚ÄúHello,‚Äù another woman in the crowd shouts in agreement. ‚ÄúOpen your eyes,‚Äù she says. 
In case anyone is not aware, the federal government is part of the government. 
While Hillary Clinton wants to bring in millions of foreigners to take jobs and welfare from the poorest of Americans, Donald Trump wants to help our own and put the needs of Americans first.

Islamic indoctrination is now mandatory in German schools. 
From The Daily Express : 
PUPILS at a primary school were forced to chant ‚ÄúAllahu Akhbar‚Äù and ‚Äúthere is no God but Allah‚Äù, an appalled father has claimed. 
The father of the pupil at the girl‚Äôs primary school in German ski resort Garmisch-Partenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. 
He claimed she had been ‚Äúforced‚Äù by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. 
The handout read: ‚ÄúOh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.‚Äù 
It had been given to the girl during a lesson in ‚Äúethics‚Äù at the Bavarian school. 
What are they going to teach, the ethics of conquest and slavery? 
Here‚Äôs another story from yesterday in RT : 
Parents of a German teenager may face a trial and fine for ‚Äútruancy‚Äù after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his ‚Äúindoctrination‚Äù by Islamic radicals. 
The story broke in mid-June, when parents of a 13-year-old student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. 
In a letter to the class teacher quoted by the NDR, the teen‚Äôs father argued that his son would be ‚Äúindoctrinated‚Äù in the mosque. He went on to say that ‚Äúfor years we have been hearing reports about religiously-motivated violence connected with Islamic people.‚Äù 
A local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of ‚Ç¨300 ($328), referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy. 
‚Äî Alexandra Witt (@AlexiaStellar) October 23, 2016 
When the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter Mueller-Rakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial, Spiegel reported on Wednesday. 
The parents‚Äô lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their son‚Äôs ‚Äúbodily safety.‚Äù 
Denying any faith-based motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that ‚Äúnobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will.‚Äù 
‚Ä¶School principal Renate Fritzsche ‚Ä¶ told NDR that the field trip to the mosque was meant to promote tolerance and diversity. 
‚ÄúWe also have Muslim children with us and Muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions,‚Äù she said, adding that swimming lessons and sex education are compulsory for Muslim children as well. ‚ÄúIt is not the responsibility of the parents to say: ‚ÄòMy child will attend such or such class,‚Äô‚Äù Fritzsche asserted. 
Intolerance will not be tolerated!

Marketing executive Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton ‚Äúmay not be the best face‚Äù to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize ‚Äútrending figures‚Äù as par of an ‚Äúinfusion to pull younger voters‚Äù because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the crap that young people pay attention to‚Äù. Bronfein goes on to state, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs f**king dumb but being ‚Äúcool‚Äù counts for more than it maybe should.‚Äù She references Bill Clinton‚Äôs saxophone playing as an example of this before asserting, ‚ÄúI hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they ‚Äúfollow‚Äù. So if someone they identify as cool endorses ‚Äì they will likely fall in line with that candidate.‚Äù Bronfein is introduced to John Podesta in another email as someone who ‚Äúcould be immensely helpful in improving HRC‚Äôs connection to millennials.‚Äù The email is yet another example of the disdain that Hillary insiders have for Clinton‚Äôs own voters. Yesterday, we highlighted how Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accused Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being ‚Äústupid‚Äù. In an audio recording leaked earlier this month, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape saying Bernie Sanders supporters are ‚Äúliving in their parents‚Äô basement‚Äù and had bought into a ‚Äúfalse promise‚Äù. In another email , Clinton operative Bill Ivey spoke of the need to maintain political power by producing ‚Äúan unaware and compliant citizenry‚Äù.

A woman in Hollywood, Maryland is the latest in a number of early voters to claim that her ballot was switched to Hillary Clinton after she had tried to vote for Donald Trump. Maryland Trump Supporter: They Switched My Vote to Hillary ‚Äì https://t.co/FkNiEUOZHH pic.twitter.com/dalY9KBWtj 
‚Äî Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 28, 2016 Noting that she had seen reports on the news of votes being flipped, the woman said, ‚ÄúI went in and voted a straight Republican ticket and thank God I went back and checked and they had switched my vote from Trump to (Hillary).‚Äù She said that she had to get the vote changed back by alerting election officials, who simply told her to vote for a second time. ‚ÄúI went back the second time and made sure they didn‚Äôt change it,‚Äù she concluded. As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton. One election official responded by claiming the problems were caused by voters not understanding how to use the machines properly. ‚ÄúTypically, we‚Äôve found it‚Äôs voter error with the equipment,‚Äù Frank Phillips, Tarrant County‚Äôs election administrator, told WFAA . ‚ÄúSometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates ‚Ä¶ or do something with the wheel‚Ä¶.There is not an issue with the equipment.‚Äù However, Trump supporters continue to point to the reports as evidence that vote fraud may be taking place.

A new study found that women have caught up with men as the heavy drinkers over the past 100 years. 
BMJ Open released their journal that came to the conclusion that women are drinking more alcohol than men and it is having health ramifications. The study, which looked at over 4 million people over a period of over a century, suggested that this is a result from ‚Äúsuccessful marketing campaigns‚Äù and sweeter alcoholic products being designed for younger women. 
‚ÄúThese results have implications for the framing and targeting of alcohol-use prevention and intervention programs.

One might think Big Pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more well-known diseases, but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next ‚Äúbig thing‚Äù in rare diseases. 
Big Pharma‚Äôs profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases, simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments. 
The search for the next money-maker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments, which may explain why they still haven‚Äôt discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the world‚Äôs population. 
In 1983, the Orphan Drug Act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs weren‚Äôt as profitable. 
Because of the incentives, which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees, over 500 new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced. 
For common illnesses, Big Pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug. For example, Liptior (atorvastatin), which is used to regulate cholesterol, generates a sales profit of $131 billion with the prescription only costing patients around $2 per day. 
But with rare diseases, prices must be kept high in order to keep Big Pharma in business. This means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures, their pocketbooks are in for a hit. 
For example, the cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco by Vertex costs individual patients $311,000. 
Gilead‚Äôs Sovaldi, used to treat Hepatitis C, cashes in at $84,000 for a paltry 12-week course of medication. 
And Soliris, used to treat rare blood conditions, costs the patient a whopping $400,000 per year. 
The list of the 10 most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat ‚Äúorphan‚Äù or uncommon illnesses. 
Thanks to these laws that allow Big Pharma to charge these insane amounts of money, they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows.

Increasing real revenues affect people‚Äôs lifestyle choices J√∂rg Guido H√ºlsmann | Mises.org   
Let me first state my position and then add a few arguments to back it up. 
Economic growth typically entails a re-allocation of labor away from industrial production, but it does not all by itself lead to falling industrial output. The decline of industrial production in the US and France in the past thirty years is to some extent due to capital exports, but especially to government interventionism in the form of mushrooming labor, business and financial regulations, education policies, social security funding, and taxation. This decline cannot be stopped through more interventions, even if they are designed with the good intention to reindustrialize the country. 
Now let me offer a few considerations in support of these contentions. 
The reallocation of labor in a growing economy results most notably from capital accumulation and from changing preferences of the working-age population. Further investments and extensions of the existing structure of production make it necessary to spend more time devising new methods, preparing industrial activity, coordinating and monitoring supply chains. Low-quality blue-collar labor diminishes, whereas there is some increase in high-quality blue-collars, but especially an increase in white-collars working in and around the supply chains. 
Increasing real revenues affect people‚Äôs lifestyle choices. Rather than laboring long hours that provide essentially a monetary reward, they increasingly prefer enjoyable activities that provide immediate psychological and emotional rewards. Thus the blossoming of artistic, intellectual, and scientific activities in developed countries, at the expense of traditional industrial pursuits. 
As a natural consequence of economic growth, therefore, industrial production declines relative to what it could be if it attracted even more people. But this does neither imply a shrinking physical industrial output, nor does it imply shrinking industrial revenues. Capital accumulation and technological progress make it possible that industry thrives even when less people have industrial employment. Germany provides an example. 
In the past thirty years, western capitalists have invested large amounts of capital in formerly communist countries of the East and Far East. This reallocation of capital, though beneficial from the overall point of view of the world economy, has been detrimental in the short-run to the industrial development of those western countries where the capital would otherwise have been used. 
But capital investments in countries such as France and the US have declined even more as a result of mushrooming government interventions. Welfare checks diminish the incentive to accept low-paying and non-gratifying industrial jobs. Massive subsidies for secondary and higher education artificially prolong schooling; reduce the supply of qualified manual labor; and create an artificial bias among the working-age population for scientific, intellectual, and artistic activities. Panoply of regulations have, on the one hand, increased the costs of doing business and, on the other hand, stimulated rent-seeking and manifold forms of evasion and regulatory arbitrage. Today they are feeding entire armies of lawyers, accountants, auditors, and financial advisors, all at the expense of ordinary business. 
These tendencies cannot be stopped through so-called reindustrialization policies, which boil down to even more government spending, premised on the spurious notion that irresponsible (and often also inexperienced) politicians know best how to use the available scarce resources. Such policies have utterly failed in the past (Airbus included), and will fail in the future. Genuine reindustrialization requires more oxygen for industry. It requires nothing less than a rollback of the artificial obstacles for industrial development that government interventions have created in past generations.

The email that lead to the hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta‚Äôs Gmail account was published online Friday by WikiLeaks. 
The malicious March 2016 email, which claims to be from Google, asked Podesta to change his password due to unauthorized access from an IP address in the Ukraine. 
Clinton campaign staff members who viewed the email were convinced it was genuine. Clinton insider Sara Latham argued ‚ÄúThe gmail one is REAL‚Äù while even Clinton campaign IT specialist Charles Delavan said ‚ÄúThis is a legitimate email.‚Äù 
The first suspicious aspect of the email, unnoticed by the Clinton camp, was the ‚Äúbit.ly‚Äù password reset link. Bitly, a website that shortens long web addresses, would not be found in an official email from Google. 
As first reported by Motherboard earlier this month, examination of the Bitly link that redirected Podesta to a fake Google webpage also contained several red flags. 
The Bitly link helped hide not only the fact that the landing page ended in ‚Äú.tk‚Äù instead of ‚Äú.com‚Äù but that the web page itself failed to use HTTPS encryption. Such links were also likely used to fool Google‚Äôs spam filters. 
Prior analysis of the phishing link by cybersecurity group SecureWorks revealed the hackers also made a significant operation security mistake ‚Äì they failed to make their two Bitly accounts private. 
The public accounts revealed the hackers had created 8,909 similar links to use against 3,907 Gmail accounts between October 2015 and May 2016. 
SecureWorks notes that the targets included ‚Äúindividuals in Russia and the former Soviet states, current and former military and government personnel in the U.S. and Europe, individuals working in the defense and government supply chain, and authors and journalists.‚Äù 
Accounts linked to the 2016 election were also in the hackers‚Äô sights. 
‚ÄúSpecific targets include staff working for or associated with Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), including individuals managing Clinton‚Äôs communications, travel, campaign finances, and advising her on policy.‚Äù 
Thomas Rid, a professor at King‚Äôs college, displayed on Twitter how decoding the phishing links could reveal the specific emails being targeted. 
Click to enlarge Interestingly, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, whose emails were released by the website DCLeaks in September, was also targeted by the same hackers. 
Click to enlarge This connection suggests the hackers who provided WikiLeaks with the Podesta emails and DCLeaks with the Powell emails are likely one in the same. The Bitly accounts are also behind the malicious email sent to retired four-star General Philip Mark Breedlove ‚Äì whose emails appeared on DCLeaks in April. 
Numerous cybersecurity groups have accused the Russian government of being responsible not only for the above election season hacks but for creating DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0. to disseminate the data. The U.S. government also publicly blamed Russia on October 7 just one week before the CIA was tasked with preparing a possible retaliatory ‚Äú cyber strike .‚Äù 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied involvement, arguing that the contents of the hacks are far more important than who is responsible. 
‚ÄúListen, does it even matter who hacked this data?‚Äô‚Äô Putin said on September 1. ‚ÄúThe important thing is the content that was given to the public.‚Äô‚Äô 
Putin again dismissed US ‚Äúhysteria‚Äù concerning the hacks on Thursday during an annual speech at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. 
‚ÄúHysteria has been whipped up in the United States about the influence of Russia over the U.S. presidential election,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people‚Äôs choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power.‚Äù NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

If we read the newspapers or listen to the experts, Britain faces two ways to negotiate its way out of the European Union without succumbing to the protectionists‚Äô sirens. 
The first is a deal √† la Norway not only with full access to the common market, but also with full implementation of EU law and a contribution to the EU budget as is the case for every member State. The second option would be a trade treaty such as the one negotiated between the EU and Canada. However, a viable third opportunity exists: unilateral free-trade. 
Contrary to what is often assumed, unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal which cannot be reached in today‚Äôs world. Unilateral free trade is genuine free-trade. It is also the most pragmatic and efficient strategy to foster commerce and peace. Theresa May seems ready to conduct an interventionist industrial and economic policy which oddly resembles French planning as it existed in the 50s and 60s. But, the free-market policy paradigm is more likely to transform post-Brexit Britain into a flourishing economy. 
Unilateral Free Trade: The British Tradition 
The tradition of unilateral free trade is tightly linked to the UK. With the victory of the liberals in the 1840s, Britain became strongly committed to unilateral free trade and from 1845 to at least 1914, free trade was politically unassailable. Trade treaties, however, were seen as inherently suspicious. Sir Robert Peel, when announcing the repeal of the Corn Laws in the House of Commons in 1846, brilliantly warned: 
I trust the government ‚Ä¶ will not resume the policy which they and we have found most inconvenient, namely the haggling with foreign countries about reciprocal concessions, instead of taking that independent course which we believe to be conducive to our own interests. ‚Ä¶ [L]et us trust that our example, with the proof of practical benefits we derive from it, will at no remote period insure the adoption of the principles on which we have acted. ‚Ä¶ Let, therefore, our commerce be as free as our institutions. Let us proclaim commerce free, and nation after nation will follow our example. This repeal of the Corn Laws was the result of an intense political effort, especially by Cobden and the Anti-Corn Law League, who made the case for unilateral free trade. Cobden in his later years explained: 
We came to the conclusion that the less we attempted to persuade foreigners to adopt our trade principles, the better, for we discovered so much suspicion of the motives of England, that it was lending an argument to the protectionists abroad to incite the popular feeling against the free-traders. ‚Ä¶ To take away this pretense, we avowed our total indifference whether other nations became free-traders or not; but we should abolish Protection for our own selves, and leave other countries to take whatever course they liked best. Some will argue that the UK soon departed from unilateral free trade with the Cobden-Chevalier treaty of 1860 which Cobden himself supported and negotiated. It is less known however that this treaty was primarily a way to avoid conflict. After Orsini‚Äôs attempt to murder Napol√©on III in 1858, the emperor was convinced, by this same Orsini, to support the cause of Italian independence. This Italian question brought England to the edge of war with France. Being strongly anti-militarists, both Cobden and Chevalier looked at a trade treaty not primarily as a way to adopt free trade, but as a way to establish friendship between France and England. Gladstone, himself an ardent unilateralist, in retrospect held that ‚Äúthere were only two alternatives, one of them the French treaty & the other war with France.‚Äù And Cobden felt that the treaty was ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs own method to produce an entente cordiale.‚Äù 
Commercially, the treaty was an incredible success mainly because it was not supervised by bureaucrats ‚Äî as is the case today with trade treaties ‚Äî but by two prominent free traders. As Cobden was aware of all the dangers for real free trade contained in the negotiations of trade treaties, he proceeded very carefully. Cobden wrote in a letter to the great British free trader John Bright, ‚ÄúI will undertake that there is not a syllable on our side of the Treaty that is inconsistent with the soundest principles of Free Trade.‚Äù Nonetheless, Bright remained a skeptic and remarked: 
Governments seem as a rule to be standing conspiracies to rob and bamboozle people, and why should that of Louis Napoleon be an exception? The more I see of the rulers of the world, the less of wisdom or greatness do I find necessary for the government of mankind. To convince Cobden of the benefits brought about by a treaty, Michel Chevalier showed that the unilateral reductions of tariffs that Bright asked for could constitute the British side of the bargain and could be extended to all other nations, thus avoiding a clear violation of British unilateralism. 
Free Trade With or Without You 
The unilateral free trade program is very simple: the British Parliament declares the abolition of all tariffs. To avoid a race in non-tariff barriers, the Parliament can pass a law declaring that every product which conforms to the EU norms and regulations can be sold freely in the UK. This should not be a problem since the UK still is a member of the EU. By Parliament‚Äôs act, most of the ‚Äúnon-tariff barrier‚Äù problem withers away without any need for regulatory harmonization. If the EU legislator considers it necessary to regulate the curvature of vegetables, so be it! But, although EU producers will be free to sell their product in the UK, the British legislator may deem it unnecessary to regulate its producers in the same absurd way. 
The advantages of this approach are many. First, the UK can have free trade now instead of waiting through years of negotiations. No need to wait for bureaucrats to agree on which laws we burden consumers and producers with. 
The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), for example, between the EU and Canada contrasts the expediency of unilateralism with endless negotiations. Negotiations about CETA were started in October 2008 and finished in August 2014. But for the treaty to be effective, each EU member State still has to ratify it. Worse, in some European federal member States, the treaty must be agreed upon by the local federated States. This is why Wallonia recently vetoed CETA, thus threatening the work of a six-year-long negotiation. In the case of the UK ‚Äî and whether or not trade treaties are actually advancing free trade ‚Äî the British economy cannot afford to wait that long for free trade. 
The second major advantage of unilateralism is the message you send to Brussels. You are signifying to the EU apparatus that ‚Äúwith or without you, we will have free trade!‚Äù At this point, the EU will have no leverage left with the UK. The negotiation of a trade treaty, on the other hand is a hopelessly utopian solution, not only because of the obvious coordination problem between the 28 EU member States, but also because the EU has a vested interest in making sure Brexit fails. Eurocrats, starting from the contestable assumption that the UK has much more to lose than the EU, will try to concoct a deal as bad as possible for their fellow Anglo-Saxon neighbors. 
Free Trade First, Negotiations Later 
Still, it is possible that after having declared free trade unilaterally, the EU will decide to restrict the access of British corporations to the single market. This is a particularly valid concern in the financial sector were banks and other financial institutions need licenses to operate in the EU member States. The concern with unilateral free trade is that by respecting it, it will remove any leverage the British government has to negotiate a favorable access to other actual and potential commercial partners. Without a treaty, commercial partners, it is thought, will soon erect protectionist barriers. 
Unilateral free trade, however, does not mean the UK producers will be bullied without their government being able to respond. First, by declaring unilateral free trade, the maintained strength of commercial links made will make it much easier to negotiate with the EU. To antagonize a good client would be foolish. Let‚Äôs not forget that this past decade, British exports to the EU grew much slower than exports to the rest of the world. At the same time, the UK is a major consumer of EU products and its balance of commerce with the EU was negative by about ¬£62 billion in 2014. 
But how can a country committed to unilateralism make sure other countries will not close their markets? Let us first remark that maintaining trade barriers to negotiate later with other nations is a self-defeating strategy. Sir Robert Peel, whom we mentioned earlier, said in 1842 that in the case of wine and brandy he did not reduce the duty, because he hoped that they might employ these duties ‚Äúas instruments of negotiation, with a view of effecting a reduction in the duties imposed by other countries on the produce of our own country.‚Äù Such a strategy was self-defeating. Tariffs in view of a negotiation, by reducing the capacity of foreigners to produce for the British market, were destroying the very interests that wanted free trade. Peel finally admitted, in 1843, during a debate in the House of Commons, ‚ÄúI am bound to say that it is our interest to buy cheap, whether other countries will buy cheap or no.‚Äù 
There certainly is a more efficient policy than maintaining trade barriers or threatening to raise some in order to force trade ‚Äúpartners‚Äù to keep their markets open. Indeed, the British government can make it clear that if the EU unfairly penalizes British interests in some sectors, e.g., finance, then the British government will work to maintain the competitiveness of the industry in question by aggressively lowering their taxes. Imagine that the EU wants to damage Britain‚Äôs car manufacturers. Then the British government should not be afraid to create a loophole and to lower manufacturers‚Äô corporate taxes ‚Äî even to zero. In an economy which was never as globalized and competitive as today, the UK would have good chances of prevailing over the EU interests. 
Perhaps the EU will consider making trading conditions with the UK harder, but they would have way too much to lose if doing so means creating a fiscally ultra-attractive market just next door. In the short run, unilateralism in trade can achieve what multilateralism cannot, a quick and radical liberalization of exchanges. In the long run, unilateralism can achieve what multilateralism cannot, genuine free trade.

The following excerpt is adapted from Mendenhall‚Äôs review of Deirdre McCloskey‚Äôs book Bourgeois Equality; the original review, which appeared in the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, is available here. 
If it‚Äôs true that Wayne Booth inspired Deirdre McCloskey‚Äôs interest in the study of rhetoric, then it‚Äôs also true ‚Äî happily, in my view ‚Äî that McCloskey has refused to mimic Booth‚Äôs programmatic, formulaic methods and boorish insistence on prosaic succinctness. Bourgeois Equality is McCloskey‚Äôs third volume in a monumental trilogy that began with The Bourgeois Virtues (2006) and Bourgeois Dignity (2010), each published by the University of Chicago Press. This latest volume is a Big Book, alike in kind but not in theme to Jacques Barzun‚Äôs From Dawn to Decadence (2000), Camille Paglia‚Äôs Sexual Personae (1990), or Herald Berman‚Äôs Law and Revolution (1983) and Law and Revolution II (2006). It‚Äôs meandering and personal, blending scholarship with an essayistic style that recalls Montaigne or Emerson. 
McCloskey‚Äôs elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice. At times humorous, rambling, and deliberately erratic, she gives the distinct impression that she‚Äôs simply telling a story, one that happens to validate a thesis. She‚Äôs having fun. Imagine Phillip Lopate articulating economic history. McCloskey is, in this regard, a latter-day Edward Gibbon, adopting a mode and persona that‚Äôs currently unfashionable among mainstream historians, except that she‚Äôs more lighthearted than Gibbon, and unashamedly optimistic.

McCloskey is, in this regard, a latter-day Edward Gibbon, adopting a mode and persona that‚Äôs currently unfashionable among mainstream historians, except that she‚Äôs more lighthearted than Gibbon, and unashamedly optimistic. 
Writing with an air of confidence, McCloskey submits, contra Thomas Piketty, that ideas and ideology ‚Äî not capital accumulation or material resources ‚Äî have caused widespread economic development. Since 1800, worldwide material wealth has increased and proliferated; the quality of life in poor countries has risen ‚Äî even if it remains unequal to that of more prosperous countries ‚Äîand the typical human being now enjoys access to the food, goods, services, medicine, and healthcare that, in earlier centuries, were available to only a select few in the richest parts of the globe. The transition from poverty to wealth was occasioned by shifting rhetoric that reflected an emerging ethical consensus. The rhetorical-ethical change involved people‚Äôs ‚Äúattitudes toward other humans‚Äù (p. xxiii), namely, the recognition of shared experience and ‚Äúsympathy,‚Äù as Adam Smith stated in The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Attributing human progress to ideas enables McCloskey to advocate the norms and principles that facilitated economic growth and social improvement (e.g., class mobility and fluidity) while generating extensive prosperity. Thus, her project is at once scholarly and tendentious: a study of the conditions and principles that, in turn, she promotes. 
She argues that commercialism flourished in the eighteenth century under the influence of ideas ‚Äî such as ‚Äúhuman equality of liberty in law and of dignity and esteem‚Äù (p. xxix) ‚Äî that were packaged in memorable rhetoric and aesthetics. ‚ÄúNot matter, mainly, but ideas‚Äù caused the Great Enrichment (p. 643). In other words, ‚Äú[t]he original and sustaining causes of the modern world [‚Ä¶] were ethical, not material,‚Äù and they included ‚Äúthe new and liberal economic idea of liberty for ordinary people and the new and democratic social idea of dignity for them‚Äù (p. xxxi). This thesis about liberty and dignity is clear and unmistakable if only because it is repetitive. McCloskey has a habit of reminding readers‚Äîin case you missed her point the first, second, or fifty-seventh time around‚Äîthat the causes of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Enrichment were ideas, not ‚Äúnarrowly economic or political or legal changes‚Äù (p. 470). She maintains, to this end, that the Scottish Enlightenment succeeded in combining the concepts of liberty and dignity into a desirable form of equality‚Äînot equality of outcomes, of course, but of opportunity and treatment under the law. And the Scottish model, to her mind, stands in contradistinction to the French example of centralized, top-down codification, command, planning, and design. 
A perennial villain lurks in the pages of her history: the ‚Äúclerisy,‚Äù which is an ‚Äúappendage of the bourgeoisie‚Äù (p. 597) and often dubbed ‚Äúthe elite‚Äù in regular parlance. McCloskey calls the clerisy ‚Äúthe sons of bourgeois fathers‚Äù (p. xvii) and ‚Äúneo-aristocratic‚Äù (p. 440). The clerisy includes those ‚Äúartists, intellectuals, journalists, professionals, and bureaucrats‚Äù who resent ‚Äúthe commercial and bettering bourgeoisie‚Äù (p. xvi). The clerisy seeks, in different ways at different times, to extinguish unfettered competition with exclusive, illiberal, irrevocable grants and privileges that are odious to free society and offensive to the rights of average consumers. ‚ÄúEarly on,‚Äù says McCloskey, referring to the period in Europe after the revolutionary year 1848, ‚Äúthe clerisy began to declare that ordinary people are misled in trading, and so require expert protection and supervision‚Äù (p. 609). The clerisy since then has been characterized by paternalism and a sense of superiority. 
Because the clerisy is shape-shifting, assuming various forms from time to time and place to place, it‚Äôs a tough concept to pin down. The word ‚Äúclerisy‚Äù does not appear in the book‚Äôs index to permit further scrutiny. By contrast, McCloskey‚Äôs general arguments are easy to follow because the book is separated into parts with questions as their titles; subparts consisting of onesentence headings answer those questions. 
In a massive tour de force such as this, readers are bound to take issue with certain interpretive claims. Historians will find McCloskey‚Äôs summaries to be too breezy. Even libertarians will accuse her of overlooking manifest wrongs that occurred during the periods she surveys. My complaints are few but severe. For instance, McCloskey is, I believe, either careless or mistaken to announce that, during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, ‚Äúunder the influence of a version of science,‚Äù in a territory that‚Äôs never specifically identified, ‚Äúthe right seized upon social Darwinism and eugenics to devalue the liberty and dignity of ordinary people, and to elevate the nation‚Äôs mission above the mere individual person, recommending, for example, colonialism and compulsory sterilization and the cleansing power of war‚Äù (p. xviii). 
Let‚Äôs hope that it‚Äôs innocent negligence rather than willful distortion that underlies this odd, unqualified, categorical assertion. Adam Cohen‚Äôs Imbeciles (2016) and Thomas C. Leonard‚Äôs Illiberal Reformers (2016) describe how, in the United States, social Darwinism and eugenics were adopted primarily, though not exclusively, by the Left, not the Right. These recent books come on the heels of several scholarly treatments of this subject: Thomas M. Shapiro‚Äôs Population Control Politics (1985), Philip R. Reilly‚Äôs The Surgical Solution (1991), Joel Braslow‚Äôs Mental Ills and Bodily Cures (1997), Wendy Kline‚Äôs Building a Better Race (2001), Stefan Kuhl‚Äôs The Nazi Connection (2002), Nancy Ordover‚Äôs American Eugenics (2003), Christine Rosen‚Äôs Preaching Eugenics (2004), Christina Cogdell‚Äôs Eugenic Design (2004), Gregory Michael Dorr‚Äôs Segregation‚Äôs Science (2008), Paul A. Lombardo‚Äôs edition A Century of Eugenics in America (2011), and Alexander Minna Stern‚Äôs Eugenic Nation (2016). These represent only a small sampling. 
Is McCloskey unware of these texts? Probably not: she reviewed Leonard‚Äôs book for Reason, although she did so after her own book reached press. At any rate, would she have us believe that Emma Goldman, George Bernard Shaw, Eugene Debs, Marie Stopes, Margaret Sanger, John Maynard Keynes, Lester Ward, and W. E. B. Du Bois were eugenicist agitators for the political Right? If so, she should supply her definition of ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù since it would go against commonly accepted meanings. On the matter of colonialism and war, self-identified members of the Old Right such as Albert Jay Nock, John Flynn, and Senator Robert Taft advocated precisely the opposite of what McCloskey characterizes as ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù These men opposed, among other things, military interventionism and adventurism. The trouble is that McCloskey‚Äôs muddying of the signifiers ‚ÄúLeft‚Äù and ‚ÄúRight‚Äù comes so early in the book‚Äîin the ‚ÄúExordium‚Äù‚Äî that readers may lose trust in her, question her credibility, and begin to suspect the labels and arguments in her later chapters. 
Other undefined terms only make matters worse, ensuring that McCloskey will alienate many academics, who, as a class, are already inclined to reject her libertarian premises. She throws around the term ‚ÄúRomanticism‚Äù as if its referent were eminently clear and uncontested: ‚Äúa conservative and Romantic vision‚Äù (p. xviii); ‚Äúscience fiction and horror fiction [are] ‚Ä¶ offshoots of Romanticism‚Äù (p. 30); ‚Äú[Jane Austen] is not a Romantic novelist ‚Ä¶ [because] [s]he does not take Art as a model for life, and does not elevate the Artist to a lonely pinnacle of heroism, or worship of the Middle Ages, or adopt any of the other, antibourgeois themes of Novalis, [Franz] Brentano, Sir Walter Scott, and later Romantics‚Äù (p. 170); ‚ÄúRomanticism around 1800 revived talk of hope and faith and a love for Art or Nature or the Revolution as a necessary transcendent in people‚Äôs lives‚Äù (p. 171); ‚ÄúRomantic candor‚Äù (p. 242); ‚Äúthe late eighteenth-century Romantic literary critics in England had no idea what John Milton was on about [sic], because they had set aside the rigorously Calvinist theology that structured his poetry‚Äù (p. 334); ‚Äúthe nationalist tradition of Romantic writing of history‚Äù (p. 353); ‚ÄúRomantic ‚Ä¶ hostilities to ‚Ä¶ democratic rhetoric‚Äù (p. 510); ‚Äú[i]n the eighteenth century ‚Ä¶ the idea of autonomy triumphed, at any rate among the progressive clerisy, and then became a leading Romantic idea, √° la Victor Hugo‚Äù (p. 636); and ‚Äúthe Romantic conservative Thomas Carlyle‚Äù (p. 643). 
To allege that the clerisy was ‚Äúthrilled by the Romantic radicalism of books like Mein Kampf or What Is to Be Done‚Äù (p. xviii) is also recklessly to associate the philosophies of, say, Keats or Coleridge or Wordsworth with the exterminatory fantasies of Hitler and Lenin. McCloskey might have guarded against this misleading conflation by distinguishing German idealism or contextualizing Hegel or by being more vigilant with diction and definition. Her loose language will leave some experts (I do not profess to be one) scratching or shaking their heads and, more problematic, some non-experts with misconceptions and misplaced targets of enmity. One imagines the overeager and well-meaning undergraduate, having read Bourgeois Equality, setting out to demonize William Blake or destroy the reputation of Percy Shelly, about whom Paul Cantor has written judiciously.2 Wouldn‚Äôt originality, imagination, creativity, and individualism‚Äîwidely accepted markers of Romanticism‚Äîappeal to McCloskey? Yet her unconditionally derogatory treatment of Romanticism‚Äîwhich she portrays as a fixed, monolithic, self-evident thing‚Äîundermines aspects of that fluctuating movement, period, style, culture, and attitude that are, or seem to be, consistent with her Weltanschauung. 
But I protest too much. These complaints should not diminish what McCloskey has accomplished. Would that we had more grand studies that mapped ideas and traced influences across cultures, communities, and eras. McCloskey takes the long view, as we all should. Her focus on rhetoric is crucial to the future of liberty if, given the technological advances we have made, the ‚Äúwork we do will be more and more about decisions and persuading others to agree, changing minds, and less and less about implementation by hand‚Äù (p. 498). Equally significant is her embrace of humanomics‚Äîdefined as ‚Äúthe story [of] a complete human being, with her ethics and language and upbringing‚Äù (p. xx)‚Äîwhich materializes in casual references to Henrik Ibsen‚Äôs plays, challenges to the depiction of John Milton ‚Äúas a lonely poet in a garret writing merely to the starry heavens‚Äù (p. 393), analyses of Jane Austen‚Äôs novels, and portrayals of Elizabethan England. Her historical and narrative arc enables us to contextualize our own moment, with all of its troubles and possibilities. 
Best of all, her book is inspiring and exhilarating and brimming with rousing imperatives and moving calls to action. ‚ÄúLet us, then,‚Äù she says at one point, ‚Äúnot reject the blessings of economic growth on account of planning or pessimism, the busybody if wellintentioned rationalism of some voices of the French Enlightenment or the adolescent if charming doubts of some voices of the German Romantic movement, fashionable though both attitudes have long been among the clerisy. As rational optimists, let us celebrate the Great Enrichment, and the rhetorical changes in freer societies that caused it‚Äù (p. 146). At another point she encourages her audience to guard against ‚Äúboth cynicism and utopianism‚Äù (p. 540), and elsewhere to heed ‚Äútrade-tested cooperation, competition, and conservation in the right mix‚Äù (p. 523). These little nudges lend her credibility insofar as they reveal her true colors, as it were, and demonstrate that she is not attempting‚Äîas is the academic wont‚Äîto hide her prejudices and conceal her beliefs behind pretended objectivities. 
Poverty is relative and, hence, permanent and ineradicable, despite McCloskey‚Äôs claim that we can ‚Äúend poverty‚Äù (p. 8). If, tomorrow, we woke up and the wealth of each living person were magically to multiply twentyfold‚Äîeven fiftyfold‚Äîthere would still be people at the bottom. The quality of life at the bottom, however, would be vastly improved. The current manifestation of global poverty shows how far we as a species have advanced in the last few centuries. McCloskey is right: We should pursue the ideas that accelerated and achieved human flourishing, that demonstrably brought people out of distress and destitution. Hard sciences and mathematical models are insufficient in themselves to convey the magnitude and splendor of these ideas and their accomplishments. Hence we should welcome and produce more books like McCloskey‚Äôs that undertake a ‚Äúrhetorical-ethical Revaluation‚Äù to both examine and celebrate ‚Äúa society of open inquiry,‚Äù one which not only ‚Äúdepends on rhetoric in its politics and in its science and in its economy,‚Äù but which also yields intellectual creativity and political freedom (p. 650). In McCloskey‚Äôs approach, economics and the humanities are not mutually exclusive; rather, they are mutually illuminating and, in fact, indispensably and inextricably tied. An economics that forsakes the dignity of the human person and his capacity for creativity and aesthetics does so at its own peril and to its own disgrace. All economics is, at its core, humanomics. We could do without the latter term if we understood the former. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

There is no question that re-opening the FBI Investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email server is a big deal. The FBI normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation. NBC reports: 
The FBI is reviewing a new batch of Hillary Clinton emails, bureau director James Comey said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday. 
‚ÄúIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation ‚Ä¶ I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,‚Äù he wrote. 
The very first thing to note is that Comey made no mention of a grand jury. The emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation. If that is the case, further subpoenas are quite possible, a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date. 
There are 3 competing theories as to why he might be doing this now that come to mind. He might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation, recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the FBI is substantial. Three days ago, American Thinker published an open letter from a retired FBI Agent, Hugh Galyean, that laid out some of the damage Comey has inflicted on the institution he leads. There is little doubt that this reached many in the FBI family, putting in print what people have only whispered about. If those silenced voices start speaking out, Comey could face a serious loss of face. In this scenario, he is heading off a staff rebellion, possibly including mass resignations. Rush Limbaugh today discussed an alternative theory, that by announcing an FBI Investigation resuming, Comey is putting a lid on further attention to Wikileaks. I guess this means that Clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete (after the election) before speaking about what the evil Russians are planting into our politics. It is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would, be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election. In this scenario, Comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed, and that he would be held accountable after it comes out. This scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis, involving the possible indictment of a president-elect before an election. Or the evidence being turned over to the House of Representatives for impeachment hearings. 
We‚Äôll know more in the coming days, and I am sure there are other possible theories and motives. It is shame that we have to speculate, and that the once-respected FBI director is now subject to analysis of his political gamesmanship.

On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. 
The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. 
The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton‚Äôs Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù 
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).";english;2016-10-29T13:10:17.353+03:00;infowars.com;US;2774.0;2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election;0.0;http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/clinton-dc.jpg;0;1;278;0;278;conspiracy

  Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: smoking age , California , prohibition (NaturalNews) If you're between the ages of 18 and 21, live in California and are a smoker, expect to be denied your favorite pack at the convenience store. Beginning in June, the new minimum age for officially jumped from 18 to 21, a prohibition move that lawmakers claim will curb the number of smokers in the Golden State, and ultimately help save lives.Joining both Hawaii and the city of Needham in Massachusetts, California is the third locale in the U.S. to raise the legal smoking age to 21. Officials there hope that, like in these other places, age restrictions on smoking will help reduce the number of smokers and minimize the number of individuals who develop smoking-related health conditions like emphysema and lung cancer.Citing statistics from Needham that show a nearly 50 percent reduction in the number of smokers in the five-year period following the change that was made in 2005, April Roeseler, head of the California public health department's Tobacco Control Program, told the Los Angeles Times that she expects similar reductions in her state.In Needham, the number of high schoolers smoking cigarettes fell by nearly half, according to a study published last year. And adult smoking rates in the town also fell from about 18.1 percent to a mere 8 percent ‚Äì statistics that experts say can be replicated all across the country.""If we can push that age up where fewer and fewer people start smoking as a teen, it's likely that we will start to have some tobacco-free generations ,"" the Times quotes her as saying. Prohibition never works; people who want 'contraband' will find a way At this point, though, very little, if any, evidence exists to show that the rule change is working as intended. University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) professor Dr. Stanton Glantz, for instance, admitted to the Times that the policy still needs time to ""settle in."" The California Smokers' Helpline also says it hasn't noticed any increases in the number of callers in the prohibited age range trying to quit, which suggests that not much has changed.There's also the contraband factor ‚Äì older kids still buying cigarettes for younger kids, for example, including those younger than the former threshold age of 18. Illegal buying has always been an issue, law or no law, which is something that the government never really seems to understand when it comes to issues of prohibition .""They're hanging out and partying together, so they'll just get someone else to buy,"" says Leonard Charles, the owner of a liquor store in Oakland. Charles says he strictly enforces the new cigarette age law, but believes that if somebody wants cigarettes, he or she is going to find a way, regardless of the law.In the internet age, cigarettes are also freely available to anybody with a WiFi connection. People can order cigarettes off the web and have them delivered right to their doorstep, which means that state-level restrictions are basically moot.And what about e-cigarettes? The State of California classifies e-cigs as a ""tobacco product"" just like cigarettes, and they are subject to the same laws. However, everybody has them these days, they're very discreet, and they don't produce that typical tobacco smell that's so hard to get out of a room , so trying to enforce restrictions against their use is next to impossible, say experts familiar with the reality of how easy it is to obtain tobacco, regardless of what the law says.When asked how the new law will realistically work in light of the fact that smoking laws often aren't effective, Glantz responded, ""The short answer is I don't know.""

Thursday, October 27, 2016 by: Vicki Batts Tags: GMOs , Nestle , Monsanto (NaturalNews) One of the food industry's most prominent players recently announced that they will be expanding their line of non-GMO products, due to the ever-increasing customer demand for clean food. Nestle may have wowed consumers with their choice, but it may make some waves with their good friend, Monsanto .""The company is broadening its product offerings to give consumers more options with no GMO ingredients and identifying these products with the SGS-verified 'no GMO ingredients' claim,"" the food giant stated on Tuesday.""Nestle USA understands that consumers are seeking choice and many prefer to select products with no GMO ingredients,"" they declared.Of course, this is not Nestle's first move towards GMO-free products. In April, Nestle announced that they would be removing GMO ingredients from six of their top-selling ice cream products, as well. The company states it is trying to evolve along with consumer demands. It is great to see that companies are beginning to realize that consumers want options; no one wants to be forced to buy GMO products.It is easy to want to applaud Nestle for their decision to continue to expand their line of non-GMO products. However, it is also clear that this company is doing so out of their own financial interests ‚Äì not because they care about what people are eating. Organic, GMO-free foods are the newest trend, and smart manufacturers are beginning to see that they will not win anyone over by insisting that GM, pesticide-laden food products are safe. ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em,"" is a philosophy Nestle has clearly taken to heart.Nestle is not an angelic company, even if they have decided to start serving up ""GMO-free"" options. Just three years ago, they donated millions of dollars to prevent and oppose GMO labeling in Washington state, along with Monsanto and other biotech firms. Truth Out reports that on October 18, 2013, the Grocery Manufacturers of America disclosed that several of their largest, most powerful players silently donated large sums of money to oppose Initiative 522. This bill would have required grocery items containing GMO ingredients to be labeled as such. The group chose to voluntarily release the names of the silent donors, after Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit against their concealment of corporate donors.Nestle was among the top three highest contributors, and donated a cool $1.5 million to keep GMO ingredients under wraps and off product labels. Nestle also made a large donation to oppose similar legislation in California the year before, in 2012. The bill ultimately failed, after Big Food and Big Biotech joined forces and together raised a staggering $46 million to prevent its passing. And we're supposed to believe they care?The controversial history of Nestle doesn't end with their consistent financial support of GMO labeling opposition efforts. It is a corporation that is wrought with wrongdoings and corrupt practices. Look no further than their outright theft of water in California.Given that the coastal state is currently being plagued by a devastating drought, you might be shocked to learn that just last year Nestle pumped a disturbing 36 million gallons of water out of one of the state's water sources, known as Strawberry Creek. Peter Gleick, president of the Pacific Institute and author of Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water , estimates that Nestle is making millions of dollars in this way.""They're converting a public resource into private profit,"" he told Los Angeles Magazine .The most shocking thing is that their permit to pump water from the creek expired in 1988. The forest service has allowed Nestle to gouge the creek for water at will, so long as they continue to pay a minuscule access fee. While bottled water accounts for only a small fraction of California's water use, the overall environmental impact of what their practices are doing to a drought-stricken state have yet to be examined.Nestle has been subject to countless other controversies, including human rights violations, and has been host to many environmental and product safety issues.To put it simply: Nestle may be trying to win over customers with their non-GMO products, but they don't deserve to. Monsanto may be shocked, but only because Nestle is still one of their own. Sources:";english;2016-10-27T11:36:10.703+03:00;naturalnews.com;US;6416.0;Nestle to launch new non-GMO products ...

Thursday, October 27, 2016 by: Natural News Editors Tags: First Amendment , Dakota Pipeline , criminal journalism (NaturalNews) Are North Dakota authorities waging a war against the public's right to know about the ongoing Standing Rock pipeline protests? We are joined by documentary filmmaker Deia Schlosberg, who was charged earlier this month with three felonies for filming an act of civil disobedience in which climate activists manually turned off the safety valves to stop the flow of tar sands oil through pipelines spanning the U.S. and Canada.The actions took place in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Washington state. Schlosberg is an award-winning filmmaker and was the producer of Josh Fox's recent documentary, ""How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can't Change."" She was filming the action at a valve station owned by TransCanada in Walhalla, North Dakota. She was arrested along with the activists, and her footage was confiscated. Then she was charged with a Class A felony and two Class C felonies‚Äîwhich combined carry a 45-year maximum sentence.(Article republished from DemocracyNow.org ) TRANSCRIPT AMY GOODMAN: But we're joined right now in Los Angeles by Democracy Now! video stream by Deia Schlosberg, the award-winning documentary filmmaker, producer, who was arrested on October 11th in a different area of North Dakota, while reporting on a climate change protest in Walhalla, North Dakota, charged with three felonies, facing 45 years in prison, if convicted. Also with us, Josh Fox. His article in The Nation, ""The Arrest of Journalists and Filmmakers Covering the Dakota Pipeline is a Threat to Democracy‚Äîand the Planet."" His previous documentaries include Gasland, which first exposed the harms of the fracking industry, nominated for an Academy Award, also made Gasland 2, which aired on HBO.We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Deia, describe what happened to you. DEIA SCHLOSBERG: Well, on October 11th, I was working as a climate reporter, as I've done for years and years and years, as Josh and I were doing, and the rest of the How to Let Go of the World team, when we made the film. And I was documenting people taking a stand, people on the frontlines of the fight to lessen the impacts of climate change. So, there were‚Äîthere were five activists across four states that had planned to turn the emergency shutoff valves on the five pipelines that bring all Canadian oil sands into the U.S. And I was documenting this occurrence at the North Dakota site, outside of Walhalla, as you said. I was‚ÄîI was filming the action. I was on public land. I was on a public road and at no point trespassed, at no point, you know, broke in or destroyed any property. I had nothing to do with the planning of the event. I was there to document it. I think it's essential for journalists to‚Äîjournalists and filmmakers to go where the mainstream media is not. And there's a major hole in the coverage of climate change and people that are already dealing with the consequences of climate change and people that are fighting climate change. So, I take that responsibility very seriously. AMY GOODMAN: So when did the police come? DEIA SCHLOSBERG: The police came after‚Äîwell, the activist that was doing the action, Michael, had called the company ahead of time to say that he was‚Äîhe was going to shut off the valve, so they could‚Äîto give them ample time to take any emergency precautions. And then he turned the valve. And meanwhile, the company notified the local police. So, after the valve was closed, they came in probably about 15 minutes. I had my camera set up on a tripod on the public road. And they told me I was arrested for being an accessory to a crime, at which point I was brought to the local jail . I figured it would‚Äîthings would just have to clear up once they realized what was‚Äî AMY GOODMAN: So, they charged you with three felonies?

The problem is: amalgam fillings contain mercury - one of the most toxic substances on the planet. Of course, the American Dental Association (ADA) continues to insist mercury fillings are ""safe,"" ‚Äì even as biological dentistry warns the public about its link to neurological problems, cardiovascular disease and birth defects.Fortunately, non-toxic alternatives - such as those utilized by Dr. Griffin Cole, a leading expert in biological dentistry - do exist.

Biological dentistry offers a solution to outdated and dangerous dental procedures Dr. Cole points out that the dangers are mercury are so acute that certain products - such as thermometers and mercurochrome ‚Äì have been completely redesigned to rid them of the heavy metal. Yet dentists across the nation continue to use mercury fillings for their patients - on a daily basis. Although the ADA insists combining mercury with other metals in the fillings renders it 'harmless,' Dr. Cole maintains that this is not true - mercury heats up on contact with warm foods and beverages in the mouth, releasing vapors which are then inhaled by the lungs.An increasing number of dentists bill themselves as ""mercury-free"" and ""mercury-safe."" Although both oppose the use of mercury, they are not interchangeable. While mercury-free dentists choose not to use mercury-containing amalgams under any circumstances, mercury-safe dentists go a step farther - they are trained to remove existing mercury amalgams by using a specialized protocol advised by the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology.This mercury removal protocol is designed to protect patients, staff and the environment; involves the use of specialized tools, as well as precautions to ensure that mercury doesn't end up in wastewater.Join us for the next NaturalNews Talk Hour and discover what you need to know BEFORE your next visit to the dentist.

Safe, chemical-free ozone destroys disease-producing bacteria and inflammation Non-toxic composites aren't the only advancement in biological and holistic dentistry . Ozone therapy is gaining ground as a natural, chemical-free way of attacking infections, gum disease and other health-threatening dental problems.Gum disease, also called periodontal disease, affects a shocking 50 percent of all Americans. (many experts say that number is much higher) It not only affects the stability of teeth, but can lead to a chronic inflammatory state that depletes the body's store of antioxidants and increases the risk of diabetes and heart problems. In fact, scientists have found that the bacteria responsible for gum disease , Streptococcus sanguis, can move through the bloodstream to the heart, causing inflammation and setting the stage for heart disease and stroke.By the way, antibiotics have little effect, Cole reports, as bacteria have shown they are able to mutate and quickly become resistant.In addition, traditionally-performed root canals create their share of infections, as well. According to Dr. Cole, conventional root canals fail because the dentinal tubules can't be effectively cleaned, causing ongoing infection beneath the surface - even after tooth has been restored and looks intact.Join us for a great show about how Dr. Cole uses ozone therapy to kill infections plus many other ways to properly take care of your oral health to avoid disease.

Thursday, October 27, 2016 by: David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags: superbugs , drug resistance , Tasmanian Devils (NaturalNews) Milk from Tasmanian devils and other marsupials may be a natural cure for antibiotic-resistant infections, suggests a study conducted by researchers from the University of Sydney and published in the journal Scientific Reports. The researchers found that the milk contains no fewer than six compounds capable of killing some of the world's worst superbugs .Unlike placental mammals (including humans), which gestate their young within the mother's body, marsupials give birth after just a few weeks to highly immature offspring -- mobile fetuses, essentially -- that still need to complete significant development in their mother's pouch.In particular, the immune systems of newborn marsupials are highly underdeveloped. Because a marsupial's pouch is a significantly less controlled environment than a placental mammal's uterus, researchers wondered if newborn marsupials might need -- and get -- an extra immune boost. Six times as potent as human milk? A previous study, conducted in 2015, cataloged many of the microbes that naturally make up the microbiome of the Tasmanian devil's pouch. These included several disease-causing organisms.""There are potential pathogens present in the devil microbiome, so the fact that the under-developed young in the pouch don't get sick was a clue something interesting was going on,"" co-author Emma Peel said. ""That's what inspired our most recent study.""For the new study, the researchers analyzed the Tasmanian devil's genome for genes coding for antimicrobial peptides called cathelicidins. They found that Tasmanian devil milk contains six different types of cathelicidin.For comparison, human milk, with all its antimicrobial and immune-boosting properties, contains just a single cathelicidin.The researchers artificially synthesized the peptides, then tested them against several known superbugs, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococci. The peptides killed every type of microbe they were tested against. Although the researchers had expected to find some antimicrobial effect, the potency of the peptides surprised them.""We showed that these devil peptides kill multi-drug resistant bacteria,"" Peel said, ""which is really cool.""Many marsupials have even more cathelicidins in their milk than Tasmanian devils. Wallabies have eight, for instance, while opossums (a Western hemisphere species) have 12.Preliminary results have also shown that similar antimicrobial peptides are found in koala milk. The global threat of superbugs Although MRSA has gotten most of the media attention, other superbugs such as Enterococci can also be highly dangerous. These bacteria -- which, like MRSA, often naturally occur on or in the human body -- can cause infections at several different sites. While such infections are minor if treated, Enterococci are growing increasingly antibiotic resistant.Health experts were alarmed recently when more strains of Enterococcus started turning up resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin.""Vancomycin is a pretty potent antibiotic and if a bug is resistant to that, then there aren't a lot of drug options available to you,"" Peel said.Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, recently called antibiotic resistance ""a fundamental threat to human health, development and security"".And the United Kingdom's Review on Antimicrobial Resistance recently concluded that unless urgent action is taken to stem the spread of drug resistance , superbugs will kill 10 million people annually by 2050. That's more than the combined death toll of cancer and diabetes.Shockingly, that review estimated deaths from only six varieties of superbug: Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, MRSA, HIV, TB and malaria.Researchers estimate that today, superbugs kill ""only"" 700,000 people a year. The number is expected to rise so dramatically due to the spread of drug-resistance genes through microbial populations, combined with the ongoing evolution of resistance to new drugs.The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance also failed to estimate the deaths that would come from people being unable to gain medical care, such as surgery or cancer treatment, that would be lethal without the use of reliable antibiotics.

Thursday, October 27, 2016 by: Vicki Batts Tags: cancer , chemotherapy , ineffective medicine (NaturalNews) Chemotherapy is arguably one of the medical industry's biggest frauds . Perhaps that's why it recently landed on a list of ineffectual treatments drawn up by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AMRC).The list was created by 11 top specialists, who were each asked to think of five treatments they felt provided little to no patient benefits. And surprise, surprise ‚Äì chemotherapy was one of them. Doctors from the AMRC said that chemotherapy cannot cure terminal cancer, and may bring unneeded distress in the final months of life. The Guardian reported:""The treatment is 'by its very nature toxic', the college said. ""Therefore, the combination of failing to achieve a response and causing toxicity can 'do more harm than good.'""Do more harm than good? You don't say.Research has shown that in some hospitals, up to 50 percent of cancer patients are dying, not from their disease, but from chemotherapy drugs. For the first time ever, researchers actually looked at the numbers of patients who were dying within 30 days of chemotherapy administration , which could indicate that the treatment was the cause of death rather than the cancer. What they found was horrifying.The study, which was conducted by Public Health England and Cancer Research UK, found that the average 30-day mortality rate across England was about 8.4 percent for lung cancer and 2.5 percent for breast cancer. But, in some hospitals, those numbers were much higher. For example, at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals, the 30 day mortality rate for palliative chemotherapy for lung cancer was 28 percent. In Milton Keynes, the death rate for lung cancer treatment soared up to 50.9 percent.The research revealed that the death rate for lung cancer patients was higher than average in several areas, including Blackpool, Coventry, Derby, South Tyneside, Surrey and Sussex.The data also revealed that about 1-in-5 people who underwent palliative care for breast cancer at Cambridge University Hospitals died because of chemotherapy treatment.Of course, the industry was quick to defend their practices, with doctors suggesting that these occurrences could simply be the outcome of data problems, noting that even a few deaths could skew statistics.However, no one really argued with the fact that chemotherapy is indeed a toxin. It doesn't discriminate; it kills cancerous cells and healthy cells ‚Äì and therein lies the rub. It may kill the cancer, but not without increasing your risks of getting cancer again in the future.A 2004 study also found that cytotoxic chemotherapy does very little towards enhancing cancer survivors' 5-year survival rates. The research, which was led by scientists from the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Northern Sydney Cancer Centre of the Royal North Shore Hospital, located in Sydney, Australia, raised serious questions about the actual efficacy of curative and adjuvant chemotherapies.What they found was that in Australia chemo only contributed 2.3 percent to the 5-year survival rate in adults, and in the U.S., that number dropped to 2.1 percent. These findings suggest that overall, chemotherapy truly provides very little benefit to any patient's survival. In their conclusion, the study authors wrote, ""As the 5-year relative survival rate for cancer in Australia is now over 60%, it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival. To justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy, a rigorous evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently required.""The AMRC urges doctors and patients to question whether or not particular treatments are necessary. After all, unwarranted and harmful treatments are truly anything but medicine .

Or does he truly know something most of us don't know?In a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have ""bribed electoral college representatives"" in a bid to ""fix"" the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed .Adams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country ‚Äì some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already.Soros also funds left-wing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer ""agitators"" at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters (acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump ).But aren't electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector's district? No, they're not. Nine-nine percent of electors have done what they're supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election Per Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories: State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties.In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesn't require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may ""extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties' nominees,"" Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that ""faithless electors"" could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector.""The Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged,"" said Archives.gov.The site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and it's no ordinary election . And Democrats (and the establishment media) have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans don't want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldn't balk at or challenge the buying off of electors.

Thursday, October 27, 2016 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: hospital visits , rising prices , healthcare costs (NaturalNews) When word got out last year that a handful of hospitals throughout Florida were massively price-gouging their patients, experts predicted that the outrageous bills for services at these care facilities would quickly drop in response. But the exact opposite occurred, a new investigation has found, with many of these same hospitals not only charging the same ridiculous prices, but in some cases drastically more .Researchers from the University of Miami looked at hospital prices both before and after the media picked up on the issue, evaluating the billing schemes at some 50 of the priciest Florida hospitals to see how they may have changed. They looked at these hospitals' total billing charges in the quarter of a year before news of the gouging first broke headlines, as well as in the quarter post-headlines.In a five-year period spanning from 2010‚Äì2015, Bayfront Health Dade City topped the list of Florida's most expensive hospitals, with price increases nearly doubling. Following were Kendall Regional Medical Center, Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, North Okaloosa Medical Center and Sebastian River Medical Center.All of these facilities, and many others, despite having their names tarnished for taking advantage of patients, were found to still be charging the same or even higher prices in 2016, the researchers learned. Other than a minor setback of temporarily decreased share prices, these exploitative care facilities are continuing to get away with jacking their prices , and with no end in sight.""We were thinking we would see a drop or lowering of some charges,"" Karoline Mortensen, co-author of a study published in the Journal of Health Care Finance that looked at hospital prices both before and after the publicity, told The Washington Post (WP) . ""There's nothing stopping them. They're not being held accountable to anyone."" The insurance system is utterly broken, and uninsured patients are even worse off Part of the problem is that hospitals in most states can legally charge whatever they want for medical services because they know that a bulk of their patients' insurance companies will simply foot the bill. Insurance companies are responsible for negotiating rates, which they typically do on behalf of patients, so in the end prices decrease, at least to some degree.But hospital costs are still prohibitively and unnecessarily expensive in many cases ‚Äì especially for patients who don't have insurance, and who thus have nobody to advocate on their behalf for fairer pricing schemes. In the end, hospitals are raking their uninsured patients over the coals, while these patients have little at their disposal to fight this medical' target='_blank'>http://www.medicalchoice.news/"">medical tyranny.Even government programs like Medicare and Medicaid negotiate better pricing in order to decrease costs, and yet hospitals are still overcharging them at an ever-accelerating rate. With the exception of Maryland and West Virginia, states have no regulatory functions in place to prevent such price-gouging, which is effectively ruining American healthcare.The other major factor is that among the http://www.naturalnews.com/hospitals.html>ho... included in the investigation only one operates as a non-profit. The rest are for-profit companies that apparently care more about making money than they do about caring for patients while charging a fair and appropriate rate for medical services.""As http://science.naturalnews.com/hospitals.htm... target=""_blank"">hospital charges continue to rise and the best path forward to address price transparency continues to elude policy makers and stakeholders, it is important to recognize that hospitals may not respond quickly to public exposure and these initiatives,"" the researchers concluded in their earlier study, which likely reflects trends all across the country.""The primary causes of extremely high markups in http://www.naturalnews.com/hospital.html>hos... markets are lack of price transparency and negotiating power of uninsured patients, out-of-network patients, and other disadvantaged payers.""

Thursday, October 27, 2016 by: Isabelle Z. Tags: reheating , toxic food , foodborne illness (NaturalNews) Nothing beats a home-cooked meal. Not only does food taste better when you prepare it yourself, but it's also a lot healthier. Unfortunately, this can also be very time-consuming depending on the dish in question, and today's hectic lifestyle means that a lot of us can't cook something special from scratch every day. If you don't want your family to have to resort to toxic fast food on your busy days, what can you do?Making enough home-cooked food to last a few days sounds like a great idea on the surface because you can quickly microwave it, but the truth is that reheating certain foods can actually make you and your family quite ill . Here is a look at some of the foods that you need to be really careful about reheating. Rice According to the NHS, eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning. They explain that the reheating itself is not the culprit; it actually has to do with how the rice was stored prior to reheating. Rice can sometimes contain spores of bacteria known as Bacillus cereus , which can cause food poisoning, and these spores can survive cooking. If rice is then left to sit at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria, which will multiply and could produce toxins that can cause vomiting and diarrhea.The NHS says that the likelihood of this happening increases with the amount of time the rice sat outside at room temperature. They advise serving rice right away after it has been cooked or else cooling it as quickly as possible ‚Äì within no more than an hour. They also suggest reheating rice to the point where it is steaming, and avoiding storing it in the refrigerator for longer than one day. Potatoes Potatoes that have sat out at room temperature for several hours can not only lose their nutritional value, but they could also create the perfect conditions for botulism to grow. Uneaten potatoes should go directly to the fridge after cooking to help reduce the chances of this occurring. Chicken When you reheat cold chicken, the structure of its proteins is changed, which can cause digestive upset. If you have leftovers you can't bear to toss, reheat them slowly at a lower temperature on the stove or in the oven to help keep the chicken's proteins intact. It must be steaming all the way through before you can serve it, so be sure to stir it every once in a while. Spinach Spinach is best eaten raw, but it's okay to cook it if you plan to eat all of it immediately afterward. However, when cooked spinach is reheated, the nitrates in it break down into nitrites, turning one of the healthiest foods into something that is potentially toxic and can negatively impact the uptake of oxygen in the blood. Eggs It is not a good idea to repeatedly expose eggs to heat. Reheating them after they've been fried or boiled using high temperatures can cause them to become toxic and upset your digestive tract. Moreover, their protein is destroyed when they are repeatedly exposed to heat. According to the FDA , cooked egg dishes should never be left outside of the fridge for more than two hours; this drops to just one hour if the temperature is higher than 90 degrees F. Warm temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees provide the perfect environment for bacteria to grow.While most of us have reheated these foods and have not noticed any adverse effects, it is important to exercise caution if you plan to continue doing so in order to avoid poisoning yourself and your family or causing digestive issues. Tina Hanes of the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline suggests making sure your leftovers reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit when you reheat them, and you should use a food thermometer to verify this. Covering the food helps it retain moisture and boosts its chances of heating all the way through, which is vital for avoiding cooler pockets where bacteria can thrive. Finally, keep in mind that microwaves are particularly risky because they do not heat food evenly.

Breathing ‚Äì a process that goes almost unnoticed and happens on such a deep subconscious level, yet it is vital for our being. Nowadays, there are more and more cases of people breathing incorrectly. 
Living in a big city surrounded by constant stress, pollution and technology can sometimes bring the body out of sync with the nature‚Äôs flow. Young children know how to breathe correctly on an intuitive level. Their body follows the rhythm of nature. 
With time, as the stress increases and obstacles come into our lives we quickly forget our calm manner of breathing and switch to a frantic one instead, without even realizing it. Cancer Prevention 
In 1931, Dr. Otto Warburg received a Nobel Prize when he proved that cancer cells are anaerobic . This means that they cannot survive in high levels of oxygen. When a body is low on oxygen some cells start to replace it by fermenting sugar. A normal cell gets its energy through a process of respiration of oxygen, whereas a cancer cell does it through fermentation. Cardiovascular Health 
Hypertension is all too common, quite often as a result of stress. In order to lower the blood pressure, it‚Äôs important to decrease the stress levels . One of the oldest and most natural ways to do that is through deep, slow breathing. Not only does it calm your heart beat, but it allows the blood to flow at a more even pace. 
Research was conducted over a 30 year period that showed how proper breathing can prolong the lifespan , as well as increase general health. The Framingham study found a correlation between the vital capacity, meaning the largest amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs after a deep breath, and the lifespan of that person. An increased vital capacity means a potentially longer lifespan. Cure for Depression 
Brain needs oxygen to work, just like any other organ in the body. Stroke has a tendency to leave the body paralyzed as a result. One of the causes is the lack of oxygen supply to the brain during a stroke. This is an extreme example, but looking on a smaller scale there is a connection between improper breathing and depression. Long periods of even a slightly limited air supply to the body caused by improper breathing, can lead to a decrease in cognitive functions. Symptoms such brain fog, forgetfulness, lack of concentration and in the end depression are all interconnected. Increased Energy Levels 
Have you ever told someone you‚Äôre tired and in return you were told to go for a walk or do a light exercise? This is because the body converts oxygen into energy through a process called cellular respiration . When you inhale the air correctly, more of it gets to your body, thus increasing the energy levels through conversion. It is also one of the reasons why people who exercise on a regular basis are generally more energetic than those with sedentary lifestyles. Different Breathing Techniques 
There is a countless number of breathing techniques for different purposes and each one of them has its own benefits. Breathing exercises can lower or raise blood pressure, improve sleep, help with anxiety and much more. 
Yoga is one of the practices that incorporates breathing exercises called Pranayama as an essential part of the process. Coming from the East, it‚Äôs uncertain when exactly yoga originated, but there is evidence that it has been around for at least 5,000 years . Yogic breathing techniques have been applied for thousands of years, making them timeproof. I will share with you a couple of my favorite breathing techniques that I personally use in different situations. Best Body Detoxifier 
Kapalbhati is a breathing technique that detoxifies your body, opens up your nasal passages and allows your mind to concentrate. After doing the exercise you will feel a rush of energy that will immediately wake you up. 
Instructions: Sit comfortably with a straight spine. Place your left hand on the knee with the palm facing upwards and your right hand on the stomach. Take a deep breath. Quickly exhale. While exhaling, pull the stomach in as if you‚Äôre trying to touch the back and do it to an extent that feels comfortable. However, do not apply strength or pressure beyond the level of comfort. 20 repetitions per set. Come back to normal breathing after each set and observe your body‚Äôs sensations. It‚Äôs advised to do 100-200 repetitions daily. Sleeping and Stress Reducing Technique 
It‚Äôs a simple slow breathing 4-7-8 exercise that helps you fall asleep faster or calm down during an anxiety attack. All you have to do is: Fully exhale through your mouth with a sound whoosh With a closed mouth, slowly inhale with your nose on a count of four Hold your breath for seven seconds Exhale fully through your mouth on a count of eight , making a whoosh sound Repeat until you feel sleepy or calm";english;2016-10-28T01:28:08.396+03:00;naturalnews.com;US;6416.0;How Correct Breathing Can Prevent Cancer and Depression?;0.0;http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Woman-Free-Freedom-Happy.jpg;0;1;8;0;8;junksci

Enjoy. Health Benefits of Drinking Carrot Juice Prevents Cancer 
Eating antioxidant-rich foods helps in fighting against these free radicals and thereby preventing the possibilities of the development of cancerous cells. Studies reveal that carrots juice is great sources of Vitamin A, Vitamin C and Vitamin B, which collectively help in the fight against free radicals. Protects Brain Health 
Carrots and carrot juice benefits brain health by helping to prevent against Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, improving memory, and defending against other types of cognitive decline. This is due to carrot‚Äôs ability to lower oxidative stress in the brain that can weaken nerve signaling capacity. Increases Metabolism 
Phosphorous in carrot juice boosts the body‚Äôs metabolic rate, ensures optimal use of energy in the body, and decreases pain after a workout. Carrot juice contains a large amount of vitamin B complex, which helps in breaking down glucose, fat, and protein. It helps in building muscle and increasing metabolism, thus helping in weight loss. Cleanses The Liver 
Carrot juice can cleanse and detoxifies the liver. The regular consumption of this tasty juice can help in releasing toxins from the liver. The bloodstream cannot rid the body of toxins and bile through the kidneys. They have to be ejected from the skin. Carrot juice aids this process and ensures that the harmful bile is removed from the body. Prevents Aging 
The beta-carotenoid in carrots instantly turns into vitamin A once it enters the body. Therefore, drinking carrot juice can help in reducing cell degeneration, and it can also slow down the aging process. Control Cholesterol & Blood Sugar 
Carrot juice works like a miracle in maintaining cholesterol and blood sugar levels, thanks to its potassium content. It is low in calories, and sugar content, and the essential vitamins and minerals present in it collectively work to prevent diabetes. Treats Macular Degeneration 
Drinking carrot juice regularly can help elderly people avoid the risks of macular degeneration. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which splits itself via an enzymatic reaction that leads to the formation of provitamin A. Strengthens the Bones 
The vitamin K present in carrot juice contributes in the protein building process of the body. Aside from that, it also supports the binding of calcium, that can result in faster healing, especially if you have broken bones.

Long gone are the days where marijuana is seen as taboo. More and more states have been legalizing marijuana for medical use‚ÄîAlaska, California, DC, Delaware, Maine, Oregon, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, Connecticut, Michigan, Maryland, Hawaii, Arizona, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Vermont; while Colorado and Washington have made history by decriminalizing the plant completely. Besides the United States, many countries have also began legalizing the use of marijuana (however, in some of these places, cultivating or transporting is still illegal)‚ÄîCambodia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Italy, Estonia, Jamaica, Mexico, Nepal‚Äîamong many others. 
After a Gallop poll was done, it showed that 58 percent of Americans are in favor of legalizing the natural plant. This is the first time in history that Americans are more in favor of legalizing, than criminalizing, the herb. Below are a few reasons why it‚Äôs time to legalize marijuana worldwide. Marijuana can be used to treat a variety of medical ailments. 
Did you know that marijuana helps in treating epileptic seizures? It contains certain cannabinoids that have anticonvulsant properties, according to Katherine Mortati, MD, a neurologist serving at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center , SUNY Downstate Medical Center . Furthermore, marijuana has been discovered to relieve nausea in cancer patients, increase appetite in HIV/AIDS patients, relax muscle tension and spasms; and relieve chronic pain. It has a very low abuse risk. 
According to Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN‚Äôs Chief Medical Correspondent, around 9 to 10 percent of adult users become dependent on marijuana. This is much lower than the dependent 20 percent of cocaine users, 25 percent of addicted heroin users, and the 30 percent of dependent tobacco users. Cannabis can be a useful in treating insomnia. 
The number one cause of insomnia is stress, and marijuana aids in relaxation. A study done by the National Cancer Institute found that patients that ingested a cannabis plant extract spray reported a much more restful sleep. It has been researched that THC provides a subject with an easier time falling asleep, longer sleep, deeper sleep, and better breathing while sleeping. The National Institute on Drug Abuse and National Institutes of Health funded studies that reported that subjects were able to fall asleep easier and more quickly after consuming THC. Approximately 40% of Americans have admitted to using marijuana. 
With more and more Americans having admit to trying marijuana at least once in their lives, it has been shown that marijuana is less addictive than coffee. Because of this, more people are finding reasons to feel safer when trying the drug. No one has ever died from a marijuana overdose. 
There has never been any reported case of anyone ever fatally overdosing on marijuana, despite the large amounts of THC in their systems. Prescription drugs, on the other hand, have been responsible for over 25,000 deaths in 2014 according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse ; while the Center for Disease Control and Prevention report that 6 Americans die every day from alcohol poisoning.

Sugar ‚Äúdoes not have a unique role in heart disease.‚Äù When it comes to dietary claims made by the sugar industry, we need to take them with a grain of salt. 
Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco have uncovered documents and communications dating back as far as the 1960s, revealing that the SRF (Sugar Research Foundation, now known as the Sugar Association) funded research to serve its own interest: to create a sweet image of sugar. 
At the time, heart disease was on the rise as was the consumption of dietary fat and sugar. Instead of trying to determine the true cause for the higher occurrence of the disease, the biased research focused everyone‚Äôs attention on fat. 
UCSF‚Äôs finding, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, shows researchers at leading universities, including Harvard, were paid by the SRF in an effort to portray dietary fat as the major cause of heart disease. In the process, sugar‚Äôs role in the fatal disease has been ignored. Singing the Praises of Low-Fat Foods 
As a result of the biased research published in many esteemed publications, life in the second half of the 20th century was filled with misleading dietary recommendations and scary headlines. 
Warnings regarding the dangers of dietary fat ran rampant. Eating fat, especially the saturated variety, was equivalent to clogging your arteries. Even eating an egg, containing 5 grams of the forbidden macro-nutrient, was considered a luxury not to be indulged in more than once per week. 
Low-fat diets became the craze. In fact, ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù labels decorated food packaging throughout groceries stores, from yoghurt aisles to frozen sections. Consumers felt good whenever they chose low-fat varieties over standard options. 
Yet this sense of well-being generated by the low-fat fad was unfounded. To add flavour to low-fat foods, sugar was the usual substitute. And the truth that has been uncovered is that sugar is a secret killer. It contributes not only to obesity and diabetes, but also to the leading cause of death worldwide: cardiovascular disease (CVD). A Time for Change 
Recently the sugar industry‚Äôs funded research has been challenged by unbiased studies which reveal sugar to possess the unwelcome property previously, and falsely, attributed to fat: it leads to atherosclerosis. 
JAMA Internal Medicine has published a study by a team of UCSF researchers showing that sugar, aside from causing diabetes and tooth decay, sets into motion several changes that bring on heart disease. In this study, the diets of 43 children were changed to replace added sugar with starch while maintaining the same amounts of protein, fat, complex carbohydrates, and total caloric intake. The results showed beneficial effects on LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure. 
Another study, undertaken by researchers from Saint Luke‚Äôs Mid America Heart Institute and Albert Einstein College of Medicine and published in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases, showed that consuming diets high in added sugar caused an increase in LDL (bad) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides while lowering HDL (good) cholesterol. 
The new research results have brought about a change in worldwide dietary guidelines. From governmental associations to medical organisations and private practitioners are warning consumers and patients about sugar‚Äôs toxicity. 
The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for 2015 to 2020 recommend that added sugars make up less than 10 percent of a person‚Äôs daily calorie consumption. While the main reason for this recommendation is that added sugar constitutes empty calories and leads to a nutrient-deficient diet, the Guidelines also acknowledge that there is ‚Äústrong evidence‚Ä¶lower intake of sources of added sugars are associated with reduced risk of CVD in adults.‚Äù 
The American Heart Association warns that ‚Äútoo much added sugar in your diet could significantly increase your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.‚Äù It recommends lowering dietary sugar intake even further to a maximum of 6 teaspoons and 9 teaspoons for women and men, respectively. How Can Something Sweet Be So Bad? 
According to one cardiologist, Dr Stephen Sinatra, sugar delivers its damage to the cardiovascular system via a surge in insulin. High levels of insulin wreak havoc on blood vessels‚Äô endothelial linings. An inflammatory response ensues, causing the walls of the blood vessels to become clogged. In this way, the stage is set for heart disease. 
Add to that the well-known fact that sugar leads to diabetes, which raises the risk of heart disease, and the overall danger is compounded. Addictive Properties Exacerbate the Problem 
It seems that the sugar industry pushed us toward a secret killer just like the tobacco industry did. This notion seems even more valid in light of medical claims that sugar, like nicotine, is an addictive substance. 
In medical circles, addiction is an altered state of the brain which causes repetitive behaviour despite negative consequences. Experts state that studies on rats prove sugar to be more addictive than cocaine. 
When our bodies digest sugar, they release dopamine and opioids. These neurotransmitters play a key role in the brain‚Äôs reward centre, which in turn causes addiction to the same substance that set off too much activity in this pleasure circuit. So What Do We Do Now? 
We need to gather public funding to carry out unbiased research on consumer goods, including foods. 
Food labels should allow consumers to identify easily how much added sugar is present in every food item. 
Every processed food item should not be allowed to contain more than 10 percent of its total calories from added sugars. 
Widespread education regarding sugar‚Äôs toxicity should reach from the classroom to our doctors‚Äô offices. 
Everyone deserves the chance to break the cycle of sugar addiction.

Keywords: art of sleeping , bedtime , comfortable mattress , deep sleep , naps , quality of sleep , relaxing sleep , Sleep , sleep deep 
The quality of sleep has a great impact on one‚Äôs productivity. It will determine how effective and alert you will be throughout the next day. The importance of having a relaxing sleep to the body cannot be over-emphasized . It serves as a means to recharge the body and brain, and give rest to all the vital organs of the body. It is important for the body‚Äôs general health and vitality. 
However, the quality of sleep matters. Making your sleep deep, relaxing and refreshing goes a long way to impact your health. Just as your body needs a good and balanced meal every day, the body equally needs a deep and refreshing sleep. It is unfortunate however that deep sleep evades most people. The good news is that there are tricks that could be learned to make sleep more enjoyable. There are little things you can do to ensure a deep and relaxing sleep. Here are some of them: Get Your Worries Off the Way 
If you are the type that thinks about your struggles during bedtime, you have got to find a way to deal with it. You could schedule a time to ruminate about your struggles during the day. You could schedule a time to discuss your struggles with a confidant or write them in a journal. By getting it out of your chest, you will be keeping it off your mind which then limits the chances of it disturbing your sleep. Keep Your Naps Short 
Many people advise doing away with afternoon nap If you desire a good night and relaxing sleep. However, if you desire to nap at all, keep it short. You could adopt some simple routine such as: Maintaining a schedule: Make it early in the afternoon. Keep it short ‚Äì brevity is the key. Limit afternoon nap to a maximum of 30 minutes. Try a More Comfortable Mattress for relaxing sleep 
A typical human spends over 30% of his/her entire life sleeping. If relaxing sleep is this vital, then attention should be given to where the ‚Äúart of sleeping‚Äù is done ‚Äì the mattress. However, an uncomfortable mattress could also limit the quality of sleep gotten. How do you know when to change mattress? Do you have to try several sleeping positions before you can sleep? Are you fond of waking up and shifting positions? Do you wake up with back and joint pains? 
If you can identify with the above, it is time to consider a new mattress. A good mattress should provide support for your curves and natural spine. Limit Light Exposure hinders relaxing sleep 
There is a natural occurring hormone in the body called Melatonin. It is controlled by exposure to light and helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle. You feel sleepy when the brain secretes more melatonin, which occurs majorly during the dark. However, less melatonin is secreted when there is light, making you more alert. Many aspects of our life can alter the production of melatonin. However, during the night, you could develop some habit that will influence the production of melatonin. Some of such are: Within 1 to 2 hours of your bedtime, avoid bright light. Reduce the brightness of your phone or tablet if you must use it Avoid late-night TV, it suppresses melatonin Avoid reading with backlit device Sleep in a dark room, Use heavy curtain to shade light from outside 
Make Vigorous Exercise a Priority 
One of the many advantages of exercise is that it helps enhance sleep. Hardly will you see any good exerciser that does not enjoy a sound sleep at night. They are hardly a victim of insomnia. Exercise increases the amount of time you spend in deep and restorative stages of sleep. 
Vigorous exercise makes your sleep deep. However, light exercise as simple as some minutes of the walk could also improve your sleep quality. Note however that it could take a while before you see the influence of exercise on your sleep, but it will come. However, avoid exercising when it‚Äôs close to your bedtime, at least 3 hours to your bedtime is ideal. Carefully Choose Your Meal 
The food you eat, especially some hours to your bedtime also influences the level and quality of your sleep. Caffeine and nicotine intake should be reduced; they contain a stimulant that can keep you alert for hours. Also do away with smoking, it does not help your sleep. Avoid Background Noise 
You should avoid things that will interfere with your sleep regarding noise. White noise is helpful; an ideal one can help you block out unnecessary ones. A fan is ideal as it not only maintains a consistent flow of air but also provides a continuous background noise. 
You can get a white noise machine or even get the app on your mobile phone. Some white noise gives the impression of rain, wind, etc. You could also go for a varied sound such as that of a babbling rock, waterfall or a croaking frog. Match Your Pillow to Your Sleep Position 
Pillows are an essential sleep aid and could make a great deal between having a good night sleep or a bad one. Your pillow can help lower back pain by using it to support your knees if you sleep on your back While sleeping on your side, your pillow could come between your knees. This maintains alignment with the hips. Used to sleeping on your tummy, a flat pillow is advised so as not to strain your neck.";english;2016-10-28T01:28:25.876+03:00;naturalnews.com;US;6416.0;Eight Tips To a Deeper and More Relaxing Sleep;0.0;http://10667-presscdn-0-56.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Sleepy-Time.jpg;0;1;3;0;3;junksci

  food waste , organic fertilizer , drought (NaturalNews) California, the top farm area of the U.S., is struggling under the pressure of a persistent drought. With no end in sight, farmers see their yields declining and are forced to drill more wells, pumping billions of gallons of water from the ground to irrigate their thirsty crops. Even before the drought, these groundwater reservoirs were already in a critically low state.Furthermore, drought-stricken farmers are forced to use more chemical fertilizers , which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, which in their turn worsen the ongoing drought effects.And it doesn't stop there. The U.S. has a mind-boggling food waste problem. As reported by ReFED, an organization that raises awareness of the excessive food waste problem, the U.S. spends $218 billion a year on growing, processing, transporting and disposing of 63 million tons of food that never make it to our kitchen tables.But there is hope. One team of entrepreneurs and investors may have found the solution to protecting our food chain, while addressing the issues of the ongoing drought and food wastage. The new miracle: organic fertilizer California Safe Soil , a California-based fresh food recycling business, recently teamed up with KDC Agribusiness , an investment group that mainly focuses on sustainable and environmental technologies. Together, they have developed a new technology which may solve the water crisis, over-fertilization and food wastage. The new fertilizer that they hope to bring to the market soon is both organic and water-rich. Tech Crunch reported that the commercialization of this miracle fertilizer might solve three problems our world faces today. Firstly, it puts food waste to better use without filling up the landfills that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Secondly, it enables farmers to use an organic fertilizer that doesn't pollute the environment. Lastly, farmers have to use less water, which is a welcome solution for the drought-stricken areas of our nation.This new organic and water-rich fertilizer is the result of years of hard work initiated by California Safe Soil's founder, Dan Morash.""[Morash] saw the food waste to energy facilities and realized that food has a lot of water in it... So if you burn it, you don't create the most efficient source of energy,"" said Justin Kamine, the driving force behind KDC Ag. From trash to food Leading scientists and engineers from California Safe Soil (CSS) based their organic and sustainable farming technology on our body's digestive tract. It can process all types of fresh food waste, including dairy and meat, in just three hours.The food waste, picked up from grocery stores across the country, is mixed with a unique set of enzymes that breaks down waste material. The result is a liquid byproduct that can be used as an organic , non-chemical fertilizer, called Harvest-to-Harvest (H2H).At the moment, H2H is being utilized by farmers across the nation to fertilize about 15,000 acres of farmland. Because the fertilizer is a pasteurized (pathogen-free) liquid, farmers can easily apply it to their fields through their drip irrigation lines, which also minimizes the need to rotate crops, as soil nutrients can immediately be replenished after each crop cycle.Third-party field trials have already shown that farmers using H2H are benefiting from an increase in crop yield per acre. Additionally, they're using 25 percent less water ‚Äì which is good news for drought-stricken California ‚Äì while reducing their need for the harmful nitrogen-rich products they used before.

  raw food , cooking , vegetables (NaturalNews) ""To cook or not to cook?"" has been a topic of heated debate among some health food advocates. Raw food junkies claim that eating foods in their most natural state is the answer to all our issues and diseases, cancer included. They believe that cooking destroys essential vitamins, live enzymes and antioxidants vital to our health.While nobody will dispute the fact that adding more raw, organic fruits and vegetables to our diet is essential for overall health and well-being, going raw all the way isn't always the best option either. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that people who followed a strictly raw food diet had normal levels of vitamin A and beta-carotene, but low levels of the antioxidant lycopene. As reported by Scientific American , high lycopene levels have been associated with a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks. According to Rui Hai Liu, an associate professor of food science at Cornell University, lycopene may be an even more potent antioxidant than vitamin C .It seems that some vegetables need a little heat to release their plant goodness. Most plants have a tough cellular structure. Lightly cooking these food makes it easier for the body to break down the plant's thick cell walls, making nutrients more available for absorption .Read on to discover six foods that are healthier cooked. 1. Asparagus Lightly cooking asparagus spears makes it easier for the body to absorb cancer-fighting vitamins such as vitamin A, C and E, as well as folate. Furthermore, higher levels of antioxidants, ferulic acid in particular, have been reported when this vegetable is cooked. 2. Carrots Beta-carotene is the compound that gives carrots their vibrant orange color. The body converts beta-carotene to vitamin A, which is vital for vision, reproduction, bone growth and immune health.Carrots, however, are sturdy vegetables and don't give up their nutrients that quickly. To get the most out of your carrots, Researchers at the University of Arkansas advise that higher levels of beta-carotene are obtained when carrots are cooked. 3. Mushrooms According to Andrew Weil, M.D., mushrooms are indigestible when they are uncooked. He said that thoroughly heating them releases the nutrients they contain, including B vitamins, proteins and minerals, as well as compounds not found in other foods. 4. Pumpkin and other winter squash Not many people will eat raw pumpkin, unless it is put through a juicer , and that is just fine, since cooked pumpkin has been shown to be more nutritious. Just like carrots, pumpkins need a little heat to break down tougher cell walls and release their plant goodness. 5. Spinach Folate, vitamin C, niacin, riboflavin and potassium are more available in raw spinach. However, slightly cooking spinach increases the levels of vitamin A and E, fiber, zinc, thiamin, calcium, iron and protein ‚Äì as well as essential carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. 6. Tomatoes While cooking tomatoes reduces vitamin C levels, it also makes lycopene more available to the body. As mentioned earlier, lycopene has been linked to a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks. Vitamin C is an abundant vitamin, so it is well worth the loss.As you can see, raw isn't necessarily always best. However, if you love tomato or spinach salads and can't stand them cooked, that doesn't mean you should stop eating them raw. Whether you enjoy your veggies raw or cooked, the most important thing is that you are eating them in the first place.

  Daniel Barker Tags: anti-GMO , crop circles , Our Little Rebellion (NaturalNews) An American company has hit on a novel way to promote its non-GMO corn snacks while raising awareness concerning the dominance of GM agriculture in the country ‚Äì by using crop circles as an advertising medium.Our Little Rebellion ‚Äì a company that sells a line of non-GMO corn snack products called PopCorners ‚Äì has joined up with Nebraska farmer Jim McGowan to create a giant message in his cornfield urging people to ""Join The Corn Revolution.""The 9-acre crop artwork also features a large-scale version of the PopCorners website address and the logo of the Non-GMO Project, an organization that verifies Our Little Rebellion's products.Courtney Pineau, associate director of the Non-GMO Project, said:""It's super creative ‚Äì we're really excited about it. I've never really seen a brand undertake an endeavor like this, so that's one of the things that we really loved about it.""The project involved some high-tech GPS mapping, a crop circle artist and a week of hand-cutting corn by a team of 15 people.A drone camera captured the creation of the artwork, as seen in the video below:Fifth-generation farmer McGowan said:""We're really excited to be able to see the whole circle here come into effect. Most of the time in production agriculture, it's treated as a regular raw commodity and you don't even know what happens to it. To see the actual chain complete with this product from that field is really special.""From Eco Salon :""The project seeks to draw attention to the baffling 92 percent of American corn acreage currently being grown with genetically modified seeds ‚Äì and to Our Little Rebellion's efforts to source the 20 million pounds of corn it uses annually from the other eight percent."" Meeting a growing demand for non-GMO foods To manufacture its products, Our Little Rebellion has had to take a creative approach, partnering with dozens of small farmers like McGowan to restructure supply chains so that they can obtain enough non-GMO corn to keep production steady.The Non-GMO Project says that the growing demand for non-GMO corn, soybean and canola is encouraging more farmers to plant non-GMO crops.Despite massive lobbying and propaganda campaigns on the part of the GM agriculture industry, Americans have consistently spoken out in favor of GMO labeling and the right to have a choice between purchasing GMO and non-GMO foods.There is a market for natural, organic, GMO-free foods , and those who are willing to put the time and effort into developing these products and the supply chains to support them are likely to be rewarded in the long run. GMO industry lies exposed, public now facing the truth Public awareness of the issues surrounding GMOs is growing. More people than ever now realize that the industry has failed to live up to its promise to ""feed a hungry world.""GMO crop yields are not bigger, the GM agricultural model hurts small farmers and poisons the planet with glyphosate, and GM cross-contamination and the development of herbicide-resistant superweeds are threatening the entire agricultural spectrum ‚Äì and the public is finding out about it.The GMO deception is no longer sustainable, just as GM crops are not a part of a truly sustainable agricultural system. The sooner food producers realize that and begin giving the public what it wants ‚Äì i.e. healthy, organically-raised , sustainable food products ‚Äì the more chance they will have to survive and thrive in an evolving and highly competitive marketplace.Smaller companies like Our Little Rebellion and established food giants like Dannon (which recently made a pledge towards GMO-labeling transparency and introducing non-GMO products) are likely to benefit over the long haul for having joined the ""non-GMO rebellion"" early on.The demand for healthy food is real, and the market will eventually be forced to meet that demand.

  Vicki Batts Tags: eminent domain , Dakota Access Pipeline , civil liberties (NaturalNews) There have been countless stories across the web that have documented those struggling to fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Native Americans, farmers, ranchers, landowners and environmental activists have joined together to oppose the pipeline and bring the project to a grinding halt.Just recently, 127 Native American activists were arrested at a construction site near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota. Despite the corporate media's attempts to suppress information surrounding the controversial pipeline, concerns about the Dakota Access project have become increasingly visible.However, one issue has remained in the dark: the government's abuse of eminent domain.Eminent domain is what gives the government the right to seize private, law-abiding citizens' properties for public use. Normally this means a road, a school or another public structure that will be used by the citizens of a town or which in some way serves them. However, the government can also seize private land if they can prove that it will provide some sort of ""public good."" This loophole ‚Äì and yes, it is a loophole ‚Äì has allowed our government to steal land from taxpayers for years, and then give it to a private citizen or company. Such is the case with the Dakota Access Pipeline.This pipeline is not a public project; it is being conducted by a private company that will profit off their endeavors. And yet, in spite of all the land that will be destroyed and the people whose lives will be disrupted by this project, the government has still seen fit to steal land and give it to the pipeline's creators under the guise of ""public good.""In Iowa, a major conflict between farmers and the government has broken out. You see, the state government is trying to take their land, and consequently, their livelihoods, to make way for the pipeline .The state's decision to hand over land owned by farmers to the Dakota Access LLC has been met with quite a lot of opposition ‚Äì as it should have. Just last week, Calhoun County farmer Cyndy Coppola was arrested on her own property for protesting the government's usurpation of her own land .Apparently, they expected farmers to idly sit back and watch them steal what they worked so hard for.Cyndy Coppola's arrest has been ignored by the mainstream media, probably because it doesn't align with their narrative that Big Government knows best. An injurious move at best, her arrest highlights everything wrong with the way our government is being run.The theft of privately owned land simply cannot be ignored any longer ‚Äì it is unconstitutional for the government to give a tax-paying citizen's land to a multi-billion dollar energy company so that they can make even more money. And it won't just be the oil and gas companies that profit off this disgusting display of government; dozens of big banks and investment firms will also be taking home a piece of the pie. Food and Water Watch reported in September than 17 financial institutions loaned Dakota Access LLC a whopping $2.5 billion to launch their project. They noted that banks have also given a substantial number of resources to the Energy Transfer Family of companies, such as billion-dollar credit lines and revolving credits. In total, a staggering 38 banks have given this corporation over $10 billion in loans and credits.How many of those banks do you think have ties to our government? Goldman Sachs is on the list, as are several other infamous industry names.If you think the pipeline is being constructed to better our country, you're wrong. It's being constructed to make money for a group of elitist corporations ‚Äì and they plan on taking down anyone and anything that stands in their way.

  Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: glyphosate , PAN report , toxicity (NaturalNews) The popular herbicide glyphosate, also known as Roundup, is far more toxic to humans than the chemical industry claims it is, a new report has found. The Pesticide Action Network (PAN) in a 96-page document entitled Glyphosate , reveals how people all around the world are being systemically poisoned by glyphosate, and many of them are even dying.Aerial sprayings of the chemical across crop fields are said to be safe for humans, because the so-called ""shikimate"" pathway upon which the herbicide acts exists only in plants, and not in animals or humans. But the report highlights the fact that, regardless of the supposed nonexistence of this pathway in humans, glyphosate is sill wreaking havoc on human health .Some of the acute health effects of glyphosate exposure include gastrointestinal and skin infections, headaches, blistering on the skin, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, dizziness, numbness, insomnia, blurred vision, abdominal pain, chest pains, problems breathing, respiratory problems, sore throat and strange tastes in the mouth.Other lesser-reported symptoms include problems staying balanced, cognitive abnormalities, impaired senses, muscle paralysis, peripheral neuropathy, decreased motor skills, chronic fatigue and abnormal body temperature. And none of this even touches on the long-term health effects of glyphosate exposure, which are significantly more problematic.According to the report, glyphosate directly interferes with ""numerous mammalian organs and biochemical pathways, including inhibition of numerous enzymes, metabolic disturbances and oxidative stress leading to excessive membrane lipid peroxidation, and cell and tissue damage."" Furthermore, the report highlights ""genotoxicity and endocrine disruption"" that lead to ""chronic health and developmental effects."" South American doctors confirm that glyphosate spraying is causing infertility, cancer Though U.S. doctors and health experts appear reluctant to report on their observances with glyphosate, their counterparts in South America have a lot to say on the subject. Doctors in Argentina, for instance, are reporting what's being described as a ""dramatic upsurge"" in long-term health effects where glyphosate is being sprayed on genetically-modified soybean crops.Included in the list of effects are infertility, pregnancy problems, birth defects, respiratory disease and various forms of cancer. Epidemiological studies have established a link between glyphosate exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma and DNA damage. Even at very low concentrations, glyphosate has been shown to damage vital organs like the liver and kidney, as well as skin cells.Not only is glyphosate sprayed all over food crops during the growing season to kill weeds, but it's also used as a pre-harvest desiccant to speed up the growing and harvesting process. According to the report, this process is used on wheat, cotton, various cereal grains, peas, and beans, as well as other crops.It's bad for the people who end up eating these food crops, but great for farmers and the chemical companies like Monsanto that they support when they purchase all that extra glyphosate. And the repercussions are startling. Glyphosate residues are now being found in women's breast milk, as well as in blood and urine. Even vaccines are starting to turn up as glyphosate-contaminated, which means developing babies are now being injected with this lethal poison.""The PAN Report is extremely comprehensive and really needs to be mainstreamed so that food growers, in particular, can understand the harm they are doing to crops, the soil, the environment, wildlife, pollinators, water resources and humans,"" writes Catherine J. Frompovich for Natural Blaze .""However, it will be up to consumers and farmers ... to make their concerns and priorities known about saving the planet and humankind from toxic chemicals in food, water and the air, if we are to survive toxic chemicals and their currently unavoidable poisonings.""The full PAN report is available for free online here .

  Natural News Editors Tags: war on women , democrats , campaign tactic (NaturalNews) Single women are a crucial element of the Democrat constituency, pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it wasn't so effective in election after election. We may pause to remark that Republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016, but we should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012, regardless of how absurd it was to suggest Mitt Romney was leading a ""War on Women.""(Article written by John Howard, republished from Breitbart.com )Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity, given the emergence of ""Strange New Respect"" for Romney this year. Of course this new respect is pure political opportunism ‚Äî and don't be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative Republican presidential candidate isn't as candid and relaxed about social issues as Donald Trump was in the good old days of 2016.We should practice a little political opportunism of our own, and put the Left's revised opinion of Romney to good use. What they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. They've wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of Russia, which means they're tacitly admitting Barack Obama didn't know what the hell he was talking about. They razz Trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didn't care a whit that Romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions.Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an out-of-touch Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. Lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about ""binders full of women ,"" and now they can't quite remember what they were going on about.As for Mrs. Romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stay-at-home motherhood. When a mild backlash ensued, the White House memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name. [1, 2]In the Democrat imagination and campaign ads, Republicans are constantly targeting American woman. You can draw a straight line from Anita Hill's hit on Clarence Thomas in the Nineties, to ""journalist"" George Stephanopoulos ambushing the Republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.It's all pure opportunism, not principle. Romney was a choirboy, so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast. Trump's policies include a family-leave plan, a culture-war cease-fire declared by Peter Thiel at the GOP convention, and an unease with late-term abortion that tracks with the majority of the country. There's precious little that could be twisted into a War on Women narrative, even by the people who used Sandra Fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery. Therefore, the Left ignores Trump's policies and hits his character, while Bill Freakin' Clinton gets ready to move back into the White House.In the Nineties, Democrats argued that Clinton's sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed, so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to MoveOn.org from, even when he was in the dock for perjury. Liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion Bill Clinton's libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy. He was good for the abortion industry, so his treatment of actual women was irrelevant.Partisan feminism is at a strange crossroads, as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics. Women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong, capable... and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism. They can only achieve personal ""independence"" through total dependence on the Big Government, which is staffed and managed by the only men in America who supposedly aren't looking to exploit them. (You're not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers.) [3]The great left-wing project to rewire society in defiance of biology has saddled America with devastating social problems, but that's not a problem for the social engineers. Indeed, it's more of a feature than a bug.Everything from illegitimacy, to crime, to the enormous difficulty of raising children as a single mom becomes another opportunity for them to push increased government power on a fearful, atomized population, which is rapidly losing its ability to form non-government voluntary structures of enduring social value, such as thriving small businesses and stable marriages.The dirty little secret known to the Left all along, but denied vociferously by them until their plans were fully up and running, is that most of these societal changes hit women harder, due to everything from their voluntary career choices, to the realities of child-rearing.So in the world liberals have made, single women become more anxious than ever, about everything from campus rape to the ""implicit bias"" of a systematically misogynist workplace, and they rush to government for protection from the harms caused by that abusive government.Read more at: Breitbart.com";english;2016-10-28T09:33:59.057+03:00;naturalnews.com;US;6416.0;Whether it's John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats always run 'War on Women' tactic to destroy the Republican candidate;0.0;http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/640/Business/Business-Women-Team-Happy-Victory.jpg;0;1;114;0;114;junksci

  Vicki Batts Tags: scary movies , immune system , weight loss (NaturalNews) Who doesn't love a good horror flick, right? There may actually be some health benefits to be found in watching scary movies, too. Experts say that when you watch something frightening, it engages your fight or flight response. This in turn raises the amount of adrenaline pumping through your veins, which can be pretty good for your body.Psychologist Mark Griffiths, a professor of behavioral addiction at Nottingham Trent University, says that there are a number of reasons why people typically seek out fear-inducing films. While the desire to experience something unusual isn't totally health related, Griffiths also commented on the potential healthy release some people may experience. ""Watching such films 'may also be cathartic, providing an emotional release for pent-up frustrations,'"" he told the UK's Daily Mail .But there could be more to it than just that, at least according to some new research. Evidence indicates that the fear you experience while watching a scary movie could help to temporarily bolster your immune system .Scientists from Coventry University took blood samples from a group of test subjects before, during and after they either watched a scary movie or spent time in a quiet room. Their findings, which were published in the journal Stress , revealed that white blood cell counts were increased in those who saw the horror film . Normally, white blood cells respond in this way when there is a sign of infection.According to Natalie Riddell, an immunologist at University College London, this is all part of our evolutionary process, which has been ""geared to promote the survival of the individual."" Getting scared can engage the ""fight or flight"" response, which in turn, causes the release of adrenaline.The surge of adrenaline then launches the immune system into action ‚Äì leading to an increased white blood cell count.That's not all adrenaline can do, either. The survival hormone also elevates your heart rate and boosts your metabolic rate ‚Äì the speed at which your body burns calories. You may think that the number of calories you could burn by watching horror movies is negligible, but studies have shown that you can actually burn a surprising amount of energy just by being scared. That's right, watching horror movies could help support your weight loss efforts.In 2012, researchers from the University of Westminster conducted an experiment to see how many calories volunteers could burn off while watching 10 classic scary films. On average, each film scared the participants into torching about 113 calories ‚Äì which is equivalent to walking for about 30 minutes. The researchers found that the best horror movie for burning calories was none other than a classic Steven King film. That's right, when people watched The Shining directed by Stanley Kubrick, they burned away a whopping 184 calories.The classic films Jaws and The Exorcist came in second and third place, respectively, for total calorie burning. Dr. Richard Mackenzie, senior lecturer and specialist in cell metabolism and physiology at the university commented that each of the 10 films sent hearts beating and pulses racing. He explained, ""As the pulse quickens and blood pumps around the body faster, the body experiences a surge in adrenaline. It is this release of fast-acting adrenaline, produced during short bursts of intense stress (or in this case, brought on by fear), which is known to lower the appetite, increase the basal metabolic rate and ultimately burn a higher level of calories.""Overall, calorie burning increased by about one-third while the study participants watched the films. Of course, this doesn't mean that you should watch a movie instead of exercising or eating healthfully . But the next time you sit down to watch a movie, you might want to pick one from the horror genre.

  David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags: soy , fermentation , phytoestrogens (NaturalNews) The recent history of soy in the Western diet has been a turbulent one, from its status as a non-food item in the early 20th century through its transition to a health food in the last few decades of that century to current concerns over its high content of natural estrogen mimics.What many debates over the nature of soy fail to take into account is that soy-based foods are neither healthy nor unhealthy; it all depends on the processing.The soy bean itself is highly unhealthy for human consumption. In addition to potentially dangerous levels of phytoestrogens, it contains exceptionally high levels of chemicals that bind to the nutrients in the bean, preventing their absorption. Soy derivatives such as soy protein are even worse, as they are isolated from the rest of the nutrients in the bean and have usually been extracted with toxic chemicals.Traditional cultures developed two major ways to bypass this problem: fermentation and curdling. Both are ancient techniques for changing the fundamental nutritional makeup of foods. These processes are what transform soy (the dangerous food) into the healthful products of tofu, tempeh, miso and soy sauce that have played a major role in the diets of many Asian cultures for hundreds of years.

  by: Vicki Batts Tags: weight lifting , dementia , brain health (NaturalNews) There are many reasons to partake in strength training; weight-baring exercises are known for their health benefits. But, could lifting weights also boost your brain? Recent research indicates that may just be the case.To begin the study, researchers asked a group of people aged 55 to 86 to engage in a mix of weight lifting and brain training exercises. All of the people who partook in the study had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer's disease , and is an early sign of dementia.While this particular study did not examine whether the benefits of exercise could be extended to the general population, the results were quite impressive. Published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society , the study found that weight-baring exercises could indeed provide some brain benefits. The researchers found a casual relationship between an increase in muscle strength and an increase in brain function. On that basis, the team recommended that more people begin a strength training regime so that the world's aging population can hopefully be a little healthier. It is currently projected that about 135 million people will have dementia by the year 2050.The same team behind this most recent research also published a paper in 2014 that revealed that weight training provided cognitive benefits to just about every area of the brain ‚Äì something cognitive training failed to do.While discussing their most recent data, one of the study's researchers, Dr. Yorgi Mavros of Sydney University, commented, ""What we found in this follow-up study is that the improvement in cognition function was related to their muscle strength gains. The stronger people became, the greater the benefit for their brain.""For the strength training, study participants were asked to lift weights that were equivalent to about 80 percent of their maximum capacity, twice a week for six months ‚Äì similar to the way in which many athletes train. And, as the participants got stronger, the amount of weight they lifted went up as well, in order to maintain the desired 80 percent of their maximum effort.Brain scans revealed that certain regions of the brain actually increased in size for those who took part in the exercise regime. Dr. Mavros says that the benefits were profound enough to warrant recommending weight training for everyone.""The more we can get people doing resistance training like weight lifting , the more likely we are to have a healthier ageing population,"" he told the Independent . Dr. Mavros also added that the best way to ensure that you get the most benefit from exercise is by maintaining a regular routine. Exercising frequently, and with some intensity, is key to getting the most out of what you're doing.This new research is not the first to suggest that exercise can provide benefits to brain health . The body of research linking physical exercise to better cognitive function has only continued to grow over the last several years. Science has indicated that in addition to better mental health, exercise can also promote both better memory and concentration.Dr. James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society, also had a few things to say about this new study. He noted, ""New research is beginning to unravel how physical exercise may have benefits for the brain as people get older. This study suggests that people with minor memory and thinking problems, known as mild cognitive impairment, may benefit from weight training to improve their brain health.""Pickett also noted that while it is not yet clear if exercise can reverse dementia, they do know that it is one of the most important factors in its prevention. Along with being active, he says that not smoking and eating a healthy, balanced diet are all essential to reducing the risk.

Posted Friday, October 28, 2016 at 10:11am EDT 
Vitamin B12 is crucial for the brain, nerves, DNA and blood cells. Unfortunately, it becomes harder and harder for our bodies to absorb vitamin B12 as we age. In fact, 4 in every 100 women between age 40 and 60 have vitamin B12 deficiency . But age isn‚Äôt the only contributing factor ‚Äì avoiding certain foods is what‚Äôs making you vitamin B12 deficient. 
Here are signs of vitamin B12 deficiency and the foods you should eat to combat them. 
Signs of vitamin B12 Deficiency Being sleepy all the time despite getting adequate sleep at night Strange sensations in the body ‚Äì pins and needles sensations Feeling of weakness and sluggishness Loss of memory and impaired thinking Feeling dizzy while doing simple things like walking Skin looks pale (yellow) Tongue gets swollen and red Anemia Blurry vision 
Note that very low levels of vitamin B12 can have more harmful effects. Also, vegan and vegetarian diets don‚Äôt offer enough vitamin B12 so you‚Äôll need supplementation if you‚Äôre either. But non-vegetarians can get enough vitamin B12 from their diet. Below are great sources of vitamin B12 
15 Best food sources of vitamin B12 
1. Oysters: Oyster has high amounts of vitamin B12, it is also a great source of zinc. Zinc boosts testosterone, libido and benefits the ovaries. 
2. Clams: Clams contain more vitamin B12 than any other food. They‚Äôre also rich in potassium. 
3. Mussels: Other than vitamin B12 mussels are also rich in protein, potassium, omega 3s and vitamin C. 
4. Sardines: This fish is known for its omega 3 properties, it can also fight vitamin B12 and D deficiency. 
5. Crab: Crabs are loaded with lots of nutrients, they‚Äôre rich in magnesium, zinc, and vitamins A, B and C. 
6. Salmon: 3 ounces of cooked salmon have 4.8 mcg of vitamin B12. Salmon is also contains vitamin D and omega 3s. 
7. Trout: This fish can help you fight inflammation and improve brain function. 
8. Tuna: Just make sure the tuna is bred in a clean environment. It‚Äôll give you lots of omega 3s and vitamin D. 
9. Grass-fed beef: Beef will give you lots of proteins and B vitamins. 
10. Haddock: This fish has low amounts of mercury and it will give you omega 3s. 
11. Milk: Not only is milk a good source of vitamin D and calcium, recent studies show it can reduce PMS symptoms. 
12. Yoghurt: Yoghurt is rich in probiotics, magnesium, calcium and protein. Plain greek yoghurt is the best option. 
13. Whole eggs: Eggs will also give you vitamin D and aid absorption of calcium in the bones. 
14. Chicken: Chicken will give you lots of protein and keep you full. 
15. Turkey: Turkey has small amounts of vitamin B12 so it may not be the best option for folks with severe deficiency.

Keywords: Atlanta , food , food waste , fresh food , Georgia , hunger , landfills , perishable food , Second Helpings Atlanta , volunteers , waste managment 
Food waste and hunger are enormous global, environmental, and public health problems. As overwhelming as these issues are, community groups, volunteers, local businesses, and organizations are working on trying to find a solution. 
What started as a social action project in 2004, a few members of a small community in metro-Atlanta, Georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste. 
And they‚Äôre succeeding! 
The project grew into a non-profit organization with a team of more than 400 volunteer drivers, a network of more than 50 donors, and front-line agencies who feed the hungry on a daily basis. 
Amazingly, the entire group has rescued more than 5.5 million pounds of food ‚Äî enough to provide 4.6 million meals. Here‚Äôs more of this motivating, against-all-odds story. Food Waste and Hunger 
About a third of the planet‚Äôs food goes to waste. That‚Äôs enough to feed two billion people. 
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) report that about one-third of all food produced worldwide ‚Äî worth around $1 trillion ‚Äî are lost or wasted in food production and consumption systems. 
Furthermore, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) cites the following: 
‚ÄúForty percent of the food in the United States is never eaten. But at the same time, one in eight Americans struggles to put enough food on the table.‚Äù 
Nearly 800 million people worldwide suffer from hunger . But according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, we squander enough food ‚Äî globally, 2.9 trillion pounds a year ‚Äî to feed every one of them more than twice over. 
In developing nations, much of the food is lost after harvest, because of the lack of refrigeration, good roads, and adequate storage facilities. On the other hand, developed nations waste more food when retailers order, display, or serve too much. 
Additionally, consumers waste food when they ignore leftovers in the back of their refrigerators ‚Äî or toss perishable food out before it expires. More Alarming Statistics of Wasted Food 
Much of the wasted food in the U.S. ends up in landfills. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste sent to landfills in the United States. 
And it accounts for about 18 percent of the waste stream. That‚Äôs more than 30 million tons of food waste that the U.S. sends to the landfills each year. 
Additionally, according to NRDC, on average, people dining out leave 17 percent of meals uneaten and 55 percent of these potential leftovers are not taken home. 
In spite of the dismal statistics on food waste ‚Äî and the struggles and pain hungry people endure ‚Äî community groups, organizations, local businesses, and volunteers in metro-Atlanta, Georgia are making headway in not wasting food and feeding people in need. People Are Fed, Perishable Food Not Wasted 
More than ten years ago, a few members of a community in metro-Atlanta, Georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste. They wanted to take leftover fresh food from grocery stores and restaurants and quickly deliver it to agencies that provide food to families and individuals in need. 
Since the first delivery was made in 2004, the group has ‚Äúrescued‚Äù more than 5.5 million pounds of food. And the group believes this figure equals enough to provide more than 4.6 million meals. 
As success mounted in eliminating food waste and feeding people in their community, the group established itself as a non-profit organization called Second Helpings Atlanta . Now, Second Helpings Atlanta has 62 donors, 31 partner agencies, and a team of more than 400 volunteer drivers who pick up and drop off perishable food every day. 
Executive Director Joe Labriola says, ‚ÄúThe challenge is getting the food from those who have it to those who need it, and that‚Äôs what we do. We play a very specific role. We do 125 scheduled pickups and deliveries a week. We‚Äôve gotten pretty good at this.‚Äù Fresh Food versus Non-Perishable 
Fresh food provides more nutrition than the non-perishable, processed diet that so many people eat ‚Äî especially people with low or no income. One of Second Helpings Atlanta‚Äôs goals is to change that standard, offering fresh food that will ideally help prompt healthier eating habits. 
This year, the group has delivered 962,635 pounds of food and Labriola estimates they will pick up and deliver more than 1.3 million pounds by the end of the year. 
‚ÄúThe reason we‚Äôre so focused on perishable food is that we‚Äôre providing nutrition to the diets of people who are surviving on processed food. We‚Äôre breaking the cycle and hope that some of the health benefits of fresh food will start to kick in.‚Äù 
According to Labriola, he sees no reason why this type of food waste program can‚Äôt easily be adopted anywhere. He adds that 40 percent of the food produced in the U.S. is never consumed. And the average annual cost per household of food that is thrown out is $650. 
Twenty percent of people in Georgia live in a food-insecure environment ‚Äî meaning they‚Äôre not sure when they‚Äôre going to eat next. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pretty grim story,‚Äù Labriola says. ‚ÄúBut if we rescue just 15 percent of that food, we can feed 25 million Americans.‚Äù How it‚Äôs Working 
When people sign up to volunteer, they‚Äôre shown the available routes. Then they‚Äôre asked to choose the route that would work best with their location and schedule. 
Most pickups are regularly scheduled. However, the group often gets calls from people holding weddings, bar mitzvahs, or festivals ‚Äî knowing there will be leftover food at the end of the night. Then, a call goes out to find a volunteer to help pickup and delivery the leftover food. 
Volunteer drivers make food deliveries every day of the year, except Christmas. Food pickups range in size ‚Äî so people can pick them up no matter if they own a small sedan or a minivan. That way volunteering is within the reach of everyone. 
From the time a driver leaves home ‚Äî stopping to pick up the food and drop it off at a partner agency ‚Äî it usually takes no longer than 90 minutes for he or she to return home. Families Volunteer 
Quite often, entire families will volunteer and work together for the weekly delivery service. Labriola says families volunteering are instrumental to educating younger generations about hunger and food waste. 
For example, around Thanksgiving, a family with two young children met Labriola one day to pick up dozens of turkeys at a grocery store. The children looked amazed as they helped carry the delivery ‚Äî bird-by-bird ‚Äî from the store to the truck, and into the agency that would distribute them to families. Labriola told the kids they just helped feed 225 families. The children soon realized what they did. One of the children said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs as many kids that are in my school!‚Äù 
The exemplary work and dedication exhibited by volunteers in the metro-Atlanta, Georgia community is a truly successful model of how to eliminate food waste and hunger. Perhaps more community groups, organizations, local businesses, and volunteers will consider following their worthy example.

One of the major reasons why lots of people choose organic foods is to avoid exposure to chemicals. However, most of these organic foods, such as beans , often come in packaging which, if not done well, there are lots of chemicals present that can greatly interfere with the normal physiology especially if there is a wrong choice of packaging company. 
Various types of food packaging can possibly leach compounds into your food. Investigate your packaging, kitchen, and you‚Äôll observe a lot of materials to be concerned about. Regardless of the possibility that you‚Äôre for the most part a ‚Äúreal food‚Äù type of individual, you presumably have canned merchandise, oats, pasta‚Äôs, and granola bars packaged in plastic bags, plastic wrap and plastic storage in your washroom. 
Most by far of food and refreshment cans which seem, by all accounts, to be made of metals like steel and aluminum in reality are lined with BPA, BPS or ‚Äúdeplorable substitutes‚Äù like polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which contains the known cancer-causing agent vinyl chloride. Your canned soup, soda, significantly seltzer or juices are likely exposing you to BPA and different compounds you‚Äôre in an ideal situation not ingesting. 
Even packaging made of evidently amiable paper might be lined with chemicals of concern like PFASs, which can be found in pizza boxes and the wrapping of slick takeout food. Extra chemicals from flame retardants to BPA have worked their way into our paper packaging as laudable efforts to recycle paper have presented a variety of different contaminants. 
The Environmental Working Group (EWG) has added yet another database to its arsenal of chemical data for consumers, permitting the individuals who need to avoid exposure to toxins to check for BPA in their food packaging. They built up the database since they contend that ‚ÄúConsumers have a right to recognize what‚Äôs in their food ‚Äì particularly with regards to an ingredient, for example, BPA, that has been linked to cancer, infertility, mind, nervous system and cardiovascular abnormalities, diabetes, obesity and different genuine disorders. There‚Äôs no simple route for your average consumer to discover what their food is stuffed in, and little research demonstrating the amount of these chemicals migrate into our food. 
A whole-food, unpackaged eating regimen is your best safeguard against the chemicals in packaging. Also, it is very important to check the reputation of the packaging company and if they are positively or negatively rated. Since there are such a large number of unknowns with regards to packaging, your most solid option is to avoid it when conceivable. Proper packaging is can go a long way in ensuring that you retain the health of your body. 
One of the key things in making the packaging safe is by entrusting a packaging company that knows the importance of eliminating all chemicals in the food stuffs. There are packaging companies that are more careful when dealing with food. Packaging your foods wrongly and without proper care can not only pose a risk in your health, but it can ruin your name as the packaging company. Below are some of the ways that you can drastically reduce the harm that may arise during the food packaging. At the point when conceivable avoid canned foods and beverages, plastic wrap, and plastic bottles. Instead, pick a glass when you can, and cook beans yourself but if you must buy, look out for the reputable packaging companies. Accomplish your very own greater amount food preservation to lessen your exposure to packaging chemicals. Have a go at dehydrating some of your garden‚Äôs harvest and storing it in glass containers. Avoid putting hot food in plastic storage containers or heating foods packaged in plastic in the microwave. Plastics are significantly more inclined to leach chemicals when heated. Experts recommend keeping plastics out of the dishwasher too. 
By following the above measures, it can go a very long way in ensuring that you do not consume chemicals that are risky to your health.

Keywords: fallout , Nuclear , nuclear attack , nuclear attack survival , nuclear bomb , nuclear bomb survival , nuclear power , nuclear radiation , nuclear war , nuke , radiation , survival , tactical nuke With the ongoing tensions between the United States and Russia, fears of a nuclear World War 3 breaking out are running at an all-time high. 
With that in mind, I thought it needful to write an article on how to survive the aftermath of a nuclear fallout. Obviously we could discuss the likelihood of such an event occurring but that isn‚Äôt within the scope of this article. Personally I believe that at this point in time, such a scenario is not at all far fetched, however the situation is very fluid and thus things could change at any time. 
Basically there‚Äôs two main types of nuclear weapons out there. First, you‚Äôve got what is known as the ‚Äòtactical‚Äô nukes and then the intercontinental sort ‚Äì the stuff that would basically flatten the earth. In that case there‚Äôs no point even trying to survive that. I‚Äôm going to be talking about how to survive a tactical nuke incident. #1. Don‚Äôt be anywhere near ground zero 
Obviously the first step to surviving the initial explosion is to not be there in the first place. Of course, there‚Äôs not a ton that you can do if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. You‚Äôve just got to hope that you exit this world pretty quick ‚Äì which would most certainly happen if you‚Äôre anywhere close to ground zero. 
The tremendous heat and sheer force of the explosion is enough to kill anyone and flatten anything within an 8 km radius of the detonation site. The intense thermal radiation emitted by the flash of light at detonation is enough to blind you, burn your flesh and start fires in the impact zone. 
If you‚Äôre outside when this happens and you happen to survive, you should take immediate cover in a building. If you get any debris on you, you should wash it off with soap and water as soon as possible. 
As a survivor of the initial explosion, you now have around 10 to 20 minutes to bail out of the area before a lethal amount of radiation (fallout) comes down from the mushroom cloud. In those 10-20 minutes, you need to get at least 1.5 km (1 mile) from the blast zone to survive the fallout however within 24 hours lethal radiation will spread with prevailing winds so keep moving to safety. You should feel for the wind and begin running perpendicular to it ‚Äì not upwind or downwind. #2. Getting to shelter 
If you can‚Äôt get out of ground zero for whatever reason, then you need to get to shelter as soon as possible. Get into the deepest underground basement that you can find, or the highest story (above the 9th level) if possible. 
If you are in the fallout zone, but safely sheltered, you need to remain there for at least 9 days. During this time, food and water should be carefully rationed and clothing layered up to prevent radiation. 
Really the best way to survive a nuclear event is to prepare for one. 
Remember the nuclear fallout shelters of the Cold War era? Well that‚Äôs what you need to be inside to survive. But not just any shelter. It‚Äôs got to meet a number of different specifications which I am not going to go into because you can find plenty of information on that if you Google ‚Äòhow to build a nuclear fallout shelter‚Äô etc. #3. Personal protection measures 
Protecting your body from harmful radiation and fallout particles is your number one priority after getting to shelter. 
Like I said before, being prepared prior to such an event is very important which is why it‚Äôs a good idea to carry the gear I‚Äôm going to talk about shortly inside a ‚ÄòGo Bag‚Äô that you can keep in your car, house or workplace. 
Some quick first aid tips: It is necessary that all wounds should be covered to prevent contamination and the entry of radioactive particles. Any burns caused by radiation must first be washed and then normal burn first aid procedure should be followed. 
Now let‚Äôs look at the gear you should have ready before a nuclear attack happens. 
Gas mask: You‚Äôll need a gas mask to protect your face and respiratory system from airborne pathogens and chemical particles. Israeli Military Surplus M-15 Gas Masks fitted with NATO 40 mm CBRN filters are some of the best and cheapest around, yet are getting harder and harder to find these days with huge supplies flying off the shelves in the relatively recent Ebola scar. I have the M-15 civilian version of this gas mask and it‚Äôs extremely comfortable, has a port for a hydration tube and best of all it‚Äôs been tested in real life conditions in the Middle East. 
Military chemical suit: These suits provide optimal protection from chemical and biological attacks and are used by the British army. These are surprisingly cheap yet are proven to work by soldiers whose lives depend on them in everyday combat situations. You can get these for around $25 from Amazon.com 
Gloves: You‚Äôre going to need gloves to protect your hands from contact with chemical pathogens and biological particles. Long, chemical resistant gloves can be found online, at some supermarkets and hardware stores. You can get these at around $10 ‚Äì $15 depending on the brand etc. 
Boots: In order to have full protection from chemical and biological hazards, it is important to have a good pair of rubber over-boots to protect your feet and legs from chemical and biological particles from coming into contact with your body. Ensure that you ‚Äòblouse‚Äô your trousers inside your boots for maximum protection. Once again, these boots that I recommend are used by the UK military and you can get them on Amazon.com for around $25. 
Nuclear Protection: There is a way to reduce the effects of nuclear radiation in your body. Its called Potassium Iodide and its available on Amazon for less than $10 for a pack of 14 tablets. What this basically does is it reduces the chances of harmful radioactive iodine from entering your thyroid glands. 
If you don‚Äôt have any of these when a nuclear attack happens, you can improvise. As I mentioned before, clothing should be layered up to prevent radiation contact with the skin. Cover your eyes with close-fitting sunglasses or improvised goggles. 
#4. Decontaminating food and water 
Water and food will be contaminated by debris from the nuclear fallout making procurement and consumption difficult, however it is not impossible to make them safe to consume. 
Whenever possible, try to use water that has been sealed in a container or bottle as you can safely assume that the water inside the sealed container is not contaminated. Wash the container thoroughly with soap and water or boil it for at least 10 minutes before breaking the seal. If water in sealed containers is not available, your next choice, only under emergency conditions, is water from springs. Again, boil the water for at least 10 minutes before drinking. Keep the water covered while boiling to prevent contamination by airborne pathogens. 
Your last choice (only in an extreme emergency where sealed water and spring water are unavailable) is to use standing water (that found in small pools, ponds and basically any water that does not flow). Contaminants, micro-organisms and germs can survive easily in stagnant water. First, boil this water as long as practical to kill all organisms. Next, filter it through a cloth to remove the nasties. 
In all cases mentioned above, use water purification tablets (following all directions on the bottle/packaging) after boiling and initial filtration prior to consumption. 
Like water, you can also assume that sealed containers or packages of processed food are safe. To ensure safety, decontaminate all food containers by washing with soap and water or by boiling the container in water for 10 minutes. This is where it helps to have a decent supply of sealed buckets and containers of military-style MRE‚Äôs and freeze-dried foods such as Wise Foods and Mountain House. 
You should consider supplementing your sealed rations with local plants, animals and produce only in extreme emergencies. Unfortunately, no matter what you do to prepare or decontaminate the food, there is no guarantee that cooking will kill all the biological agents. 
Remember, you can survive for a long time without food (at least 3 weeks, but can be longer), especially if the food you eat may potentially kill you! 
If you must use local food, select only healthy-looking plants, animals, fruit and vegetables. Do not select known carriers of organisms such as rats or other vermin. Always use gloves and protective clothing when handling and dressing animals, plants etc. Cook all plant and animal food by boiling only. Boil all food for at least 10 minutes to kill all pathogens. Do not try to fry, bake, or roast local food as there is no guarantee that all infected portions have reached the required temperature to kill all pathogens. Do not eat raw food at all costs! 
Obviously this article is nowhere near comprehensive, but I hope it gives you some idea of what you need to do in order to survive the aftermath of a nuclear attack. We can only hope and pray that such an event does not happen and that peace will prevail on this planet.

The Himalayan Salt Lamps are made from Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt Rock formed millions of years ago in the foothills of Himalaya. Salt lamps are blocks of pure Himalayan salt, so they come from the same region of the world. Also known as the ‚ÄòVitamins of the Air‚Äô, they are made from the salt that came from ancient oceans, and serve as a perfect air ionizer. How Himalayan Salt Lamps Work? 
Himalayan salt lamps emit negative ions in the air which are healthy for the human body. The ionization is supported by the bulb inside of the salt block since the bulb heats the salt block around it. Himalayan salt attracts the water around it and this process called as hygroscopic. Therefore, the Himalayan salt lamps may become dump or wet, especially in an environment with high humidity. As the bulb heats the salt lamp, the water evaporates and the negative ions are released in the air. The negative ions bind with the positive harmful ions such as allergens, molds and bacteria, and neutralize the environment in the house. Improve Blood Flow 
Particular studies have suggested that negative ions, such as those emitted by Himalayan salt lamps, can accelerate blood flow. This boost helps to improve several disorders of the vascular system and can prevent certain damage to the lungs. Purify Air 
Dust, pollen, cigarette smoke and other pollutants ruin the purity of the air we breathe, and the perfect way to neutralize it is to use Himalayan salt lamp on your room. It acts as air purifier through its ability to absorb water and evaporating them after. They attract water molecules in the air, which traps impurities in the air and leaves you with fresh, clean air: this is known as hygroscopy. Good Vibrations 
Salt has been used through out the ages to clean energies from homes and people. You can use Salt to clear crystals, clear your body and clear your home. Because Salt Crystals vibrate at a frequency closer to the earths magnetic frequency known as the shuman resonance frequency they can also help bring us back in balance. Boost Energy Levels 
Positive ions deplete the body of energy, and it is believed that Himalayan salt lamps can actually do the opposite. The negative ions increase energy levels, which yields a refreshing effect similar to the feeling of rejuvenation achieved from spending time in nature. Improve Your Breathing 
Asthma and other breathing complications can be triggered by polluted, corrupted air. Salt lamps ensure that you breathe cleaner air whenever you are around them, helping to improve breathing and prevent contaminants from entering your lungs. Other Benefits of Using Himalayan salt lamp

The answer is evident to film festival attendees who were shocked when Robert De Niro, under enormous pressure, pulled the film ‚ÄúVAXXED‚Äù from the Tribeca Film Festival. For all others, you may not need to see VAXXED first before you see Un-VAXXED. 
A new film by award-winning author and filmmaker, Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz, contributes more than the ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù actor Robert De Niro sought to prompt by screening the controversial film VAXXED at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. De Niro, whose son, like millions of other children who became vaccine-injured, came under fire from both sides of the vaccination safety debate after ‚Äúpulling‚Äù VAXXED from the event. Agents pressured the Hollywood celebrity to censor that film by producer Del Bigtree and director Andy Wakefield. De Niro later pledged to investigate who caused the censorship, and why. 
‚ÄúUn-Vaxxed: A Docu-Commentary for Robert DeNiro‚Äù was the Overall Grand Jury Winner of Cinema Los Angeles, a Film Festival which takes place annually in central Los Angeles from November 1-2 nd . 
I saw the trailer and the filmmakers, Dr. Leonard Horowitz and Sherri Kane promise to continue the dialogue and contribute to the questions actor Robert De Niro asked while being interviewed on TODAY (April 2016). He wanted answers and an investigation to the autism controversy around vaccines.

Bio on Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz taken from his website: Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz is the world‚Äôs most prolific, best credential, and most controversial drug industry whistleblower. This award-winning author, film-maker, pharmaceutical industry critic, and intelligence industry analyst has published seventeen books and dozens of peer reviewed scientific articles. Dr. Horowitz‚Äôs first of three American bestsellers, Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola‚ÄìNature, Accident or Intentional?, is largely credited for prompting the global vaccination risk awareness movement. The book caused several governments to reconsider their ‚Äúimmunization‚Äù policies, and became the center of political debate in 2008 when Barack Obama‚Äôs minister, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, credited Horowitz and this book for evidencing HIV/AIDS as a genocidal weapon of mass depopulation targeting Africans and African Americans courtesy of covert U.S. military contractors named in the publication. Dr. Horowitz‚Äôs second bestseller, Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse, prompted a revolution in the music and natural healing industries. The retired dentist and naturopathic physician‚Äôs consumer health guidebook, Healing Celebrations: Miraculous Recoveries Through Ancient Scripture, Natural Medicine and Modern Science, pioneered the protocol adopted by thousands of natural healers and doctors worldwide.";english;2016-10-28T22:21:55.232+03:00;naturalnews.com;US;6416.0;Who is Dr. Leonard G.

When I was a kid, if I were told that I‚Äôd be writing a book about diet and nutrition when I was older, I would‚Äôve thought that whoever told me that was out of their mind. 
Living in Newark, New Jersey, my parents and I consumed anything and everything that had a face or a mother except for dead, rotting, pig bodies, although we did eat bacon (as if all the other decomposing flesh bodies were somehow miraculously clean). Going through high school and college it was no different. In fact, my dietary change did not come until I was in my 30‚Äôs. 
Just to put things in perspective, after I graduated from Weequahic High School and before going to Seton Hall University, I had a part-time job working for a butcher. I was the delivery guy and occasionally had to go to the slaughterhouse to pick up products for the store. Needless to say, I had no consciousness nor awareness, as change never came then, despite the horrors I witnessed on an almost daily basis. 
After graduating with a degree in accounting from Seton Hall, I eventually got married and moved to a town called Livingston. Livingston was basically a yuppie community where everyone was judged by the neighborhood they lived in and their income. To say it was a ‚Äúplastic‚Äù community would be an understatement. 
Livingston and the shallowness finally got to me. I told my wife I was fed up and wanted to move. She made it clear she had to be near her friends and New York City. I finally got my act together and split for Colorado. 
I was living with a lady in Aspen at the end of 1974, when one day she said, ‚Äù let‚Äôs become vegetarians‚Äù. I have no idea what possessed me to say it, but I said, ‚Äúokay‚Äù! 
At that point I went to the freezer and took out about $100 worth of frozen, dead body parts and gave them to a welfare mother who lived behind us. 
Well, everything was great for about a week or so, and then the chick split with another guy. 
So here I was, a vegetarian for a couple weeks, not really knowing what to do, how to cook, or basically how to prepare anything. For about a month, I was getting by on carrot sticks, celery sticks, and yogurt. Fortunately, when I went vegan in 1990, it was a simple and natural progression. Anyway, as I walked around Aspen town, I noticed a little vegetarian restaurant called, ‚ÄúThe Little Kitchen‚Äù. 
Let me back up just a little bit. It was April of 1975, the snow was melting and the runoff of Ajax Mountain filled the streets full of knee-deep mud. Now, Aspen was great to ski in, but was a bummer to walk in when the snow was melting. 
I was ready to call it quits and I needed a warmer place. I‚Äôll elaborate on that in a minute. 
But right now, back to ‚ÄúThe Little Kitchen‚Äù. Knowing that I was going to leave Aspen and basically a new vegetarian, I needed help. So, I cruised into the restaurant and told them my plight and asked them if they would teach me how to cook. I told them in return I would wash dishes and empty their trash. They then asked me what I did for a living and I told them I was an accountant. 
The owner said to me, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a deal. You do our tax return and we‚Äôll feed you as well‚Äù. So for the next couple of weeks I was doing their tax return, washing their dishes, emptying the trash, eating three squares a day and learning as much as I could. 
But, like I said, the mud was getting to me. So I picked up a travel book written by a guy named Foder. The name of the book was, ‚ÄúHawaii‚Äù. Looking through the book I noticed that in Lahaina, on Maui, there was a little vegetarian restaurant called,‚Äù Mr. Natural‚Äôs‚Äù. I decided right then and there that I would go to Lahaina and work at ‚ÄúMr. Natural‚Äôs.‚Äù To make a long story short, that‚Äôs exactly what happened. 
So, I‚Äôm working at ‚ÄúMr. Natural‚Äôs‚Äù and learning everything I can about my new dietary lifestyle ‚Äì it was great. Every afternoon we would close for lunch at about 1 PM and go to the Sheraton Hotel in Ka‚Äôanapali and play volleyball, while somebody stayed behind to prepare dinner. 
Since I was the new guy, and didn‚Äôt really know how to cook, I never thought that I would be asked to stay behind to cook dinner. Well, one afternoon, that‚Äôs exactly what happened; it was my turn. That posed a problem for me because I was at the point where I finally knew how to boil water. 
I was desperate, clueless and basically up the creek without a paddle. Fortunately, there was a friend of mine sitting in the gazebo at the restaurant and I asked him if he knew how to cook. He said the only thing he knew how to cook was enchiladas. He said that his enchiladas were bean-less and dairy-less. I told him that I had no idea what an enchilada was or what he was talking about, but I needed him to show me because it was my turn to do the evening meal. 
Well, the guys came back from playing volleyball and I‚Äôm asked what was for dinner. I told them enchiladas; the owner wasn‚Äôt thrilled. I told him that mine were bean-less and dairy-less. When he tried the enchilada he said it was incredible. Being the humble guy that I was, I smiled and said, ‚ÄúYou expected anything less‚Äù? It apparently was so good that it was the only item on the menu that we served twice a week. In fact, after about a week, we were selling five dozen every night we had them on the menu and people would walk around Lahaina broadcasting, ‚Äòenchilada‚Äôs at ‚ÄúNatural‚Äôs‚Äù tonight‚Äô. I never had to cook anything else. 
A year later the restaurant closed, and somehow I gravitated to a little health food store in Wailuku. I never told anyone I was an accountant and basically relegated myself to being the truck driver. 
The guys who were running the health food store had friends in similar businesses and farms on many of the islands. I told them that if they could organize and form one company they could probably lock in the State. That‚Äôs when they found out I was an accountant and ‚ÄúDown to Earth‚Äù was born. ‚ÄúDown to Earth‚Äù became the largest natural food store chain in the islands, and I was their Chief Financial Officer and co-manager of their biggest store for 13 years. 
In 1981, I started to do a weekly radio show to try and expose people to a vegetarian diet and get them away from killing innocent creatures. I still do that show today. I pay for my own airtime and have no sponsors to not compromise my honesty. One bit of a hassle was the fact that I was forced to get a Masters Degree in Nutrition to shut up all the MD‚Äôs that would call in asking for my credentials. 
My doing this radio show enabled me, through endless research, to see the corruption that existed within the big food industries, the big pharmaceutical companies, the biotech industries and the government agencies. 
This information, unconscionable as it is, enabled me to realize how broken our health system is. 
I left Down to Earth in 1989, got nationally certified as a sports injury massage therapist and started traveling the world with a bunch of guys that were making a martial arts movie. After doing that for about four years I finally made it back to Honolulu and got a job as a massage therapist at the Honolulu Club, one of Hawaii‚Äôs premier fitness clubs. 
It was there I met the love of my life who I have been with since 1998. She made me an offer I couldn‚Äôt refuse. She said,‚Äù If you want to be with me you‚Äôve got to stop working on naked women‚Äù. So, I went back into accounting and was the Chief Financial Officer of a large construction company for many years. 
Going back to my Newark days when I was an infant, I had no idea what a ‚Äúchicken‚Äù or ‚Äúegg‚Äù or ‚Äúfish‚Äù or ‚Äúpig‚Äù or ‚Äúcow‚Äù was. My dietary blueprint was thrust upon me by my parents as theirs was thrust upon them by their parents. It was by the grace of God that I was able to put things in their proper perspective and improve my health and elevate my consciousness. 
The road that I started walking down in 1975 has finally led me to the point of writing my book, A Sane Diet For An Insane World. Hopefully, the information contained therein will be enlightening, motivating, and inspiring to encourage you to make different choices. 
Doing what we do out of conditioning is not always the best course to follow. I am hoping that by the grace of the many friends and personalities I have encountered along my path, you will have a better perspective of what road is the best road for you to travel on, not only for your health but your consciousness as well.

Saturday, October 29, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: Ammon Bundy , Oregon ranchers , court decision (NaturalNews) In what freedom fighters across the country are calling a stunning victory against a tyrannical government agency, a jury in Oregon has acquitted all seven defendants involved in the armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in January.Cheers broke out in the Portland, Ore., federal courtroom when the jury announced the acquittals of Ammon Bundy, along with brother Ryan Bundy and five others, the Chicago Tribune reported .The seven were charged with conspiracy to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which is located about 300 miles southeast of Portland. Also, the jury could not reach a verdict on even one count of theft for Ryan Bundy. Shocked by the acquittals The announcement by the jury did not come without additional drama, however. Upon hearing the jury's decision, Marcus Mumford, one of Ammon Bundy's attorneys, demanded his client be released, even shouting at the judge. That prompted U.S. marshals to tackle Mumford to the ground and use a stun gun on him a number of times before arresting him, the Tribune reported.U.S. District Judge Anna Brown said she was not able to release Bundy because he faces federal charges in Nevada, his home state, related to an armed standoff with federal Bureau of Land Management agents at his father Cliven Bundy's ranch in 2014 .As reported by KATU , the armed standoff began Jan. 2 and lasted nearly six weeks. The incident brought new attention to the long-running issue of too much federal ownership of lands in the American West. The confrontations at the refuge earlier this year and on Cliven Bundy's ranch in 2014 essentially reignited arguments between private citizens ‚Äì mostly ranchers ‚Äì and the federal government that stem from the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion in the late 1970s, when Western states like Nevada attempted to wrestle more control of their own territory from the federal government .As noted by The New York Times the federal government owns nearly half of the land ‚Äì 47 percent ‚Äì in the West.The Tribune noted that even the defendants' attorneys were shocked by the acquittals.""It's stunning,"" said Robert Salisbury, an attorney for defendant Jeff Banta. ""It's a stunning victory for the defense. I'm speechless.""The U.S. Attorney in Oregon , Billy J. Williams, said in a statement that his office stood by its decision to prosecute the seven defendants.""We strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a Court, publicly tried, and decided by a jury,"" the statement said. 'When the jury hears the story, I expect the same result' The Oregon case was, in a sense, an extension the tense standoff between federal officials with the BLM and other authorities, and the Bundy's two years ago in Nevada. Cliven, Ammon and Ryan Bundy are all scheduled to go on trial for that standoff early next year.It's not clear what the outcome of the Nevada trial will be. Federal attorneys have said they don't feel like the outcome in Oregon will have any effect whatsoever on the Nevada trial.But defense attorneys involved in the Nevada trial aren't so sure. Daniel Hill, an attorney for Ammon Bundy , says the Oregon acquittal bodes well for his client and the other defendants, all of whom are facing felony weapon, conspiracy and other charges, the Tribune reported.""When the jury hears the whole story,"" he told The Associated Press , ""I expect the same result.""

Saturday, October 29, 2016 by: Amy Goodrich Tags: running , brain repair , longevity (NaturalNews) We don't have to be scientists to know that exercise is good for us. However, researchers at the Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa in Canada have added another item to the long list of potential health benefits of regular exercise. They found that running triggers a particular molecule called VGF, a nerve growth factor that can help repair brain and nerve damage in mice with an unusually small cerebellum and a shorter lifespan. The cerebellum is the part of the brain important for balance and coordination.Although more research will be needed to determine how the healing process would work in a human brain, the Canadian researchers are hopeful that their groundbreaking discovery may open new doors in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Put on those running shoes and extend your life In the study, published in the scientific journal Cell Reports , the researchers reported that VGF production induced by running in a wheel extended the life of mice with smaller cerebellums and difficulties in walking. Typically these mice only lived for 25 to 40 days, but when they were allowed to run, they lived for over a year , which is the normal lifespan for a mouse.Furthermore, they discovered that the running mice had a better sense of balance, and showed increased levels of myelin production. Myelin plays a key role in a healthy brain . It is the insulating material of our nerves, and is best compared to the plastic material around electrical cables. Lose that protective layer and nerves will have difficulty carrying their messages as quickly or efficiently, resulting in a host of neurological issues.While running improved the quality and quantity of life for the mice, they had to maintain their healthy running habit. Once the opportunity to exercise was taken away, they began to degenerate again and their lifespans shortened once more. The positive effects of regular exercise Dr. Picketts, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital and professor at the University of Ottawa, said that these findings shine a new light on the effect exercise might have on people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, like multiple sclerosis (MS), that involve a loss of myelin or insulation of the nerve fibers.""With multiple sclerosis, you get a lot of degeneration of the (neuron) insulation, and patients with MS go through these relapses and remissions,"" Picketts said. ""We're really hoping that maybe if we could use VGF to limit the number of degenerations, (it would) really allow remissions to be more prevalent and longer,"" he added.Last month, another study published in the journal Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair , showed that exercise helped gerbils who had a stroke to recover their memory, partly though myelin repair around the neurons.However, when Dr. Picketts and his colleagues analyzed myelin levels in healthy mice, running didn't seem to produce any significant change. These findings suggest that VGF-triggered myelin repair probably only kicks in when our brain or nerves are under attack.""Generally, healthy people [already] have normal levels of myelin,"" noted Dr. Matias Alvarez-Saavedra, lead author of the study.Of course, that doesn't mean healthy people should not exercise. Many studies have linked regular exercise to healthy brain changes such as improved memory, increased blood flow and decreased inflammation in the brain.

Saturday, October 29, 2016 by: Isabelle Z. Tags: fast food , obesity , children (NaturalNews) Fast food chains know how to squeeze every last dollar out of their customers. From decorating their establishments with appetite-stimulating colors, to pricing their meals to encourage people to get bigger sizes, their every move is perfectly calculated to maximize profits. Unfortunately, these practices are hurting a lot more than just your wallet ‚Äì they are also affecting the health of your children.A study led by researchers from the NYU Langone Medical Center found that children who ate at any of five fast food chains consumed an average of 179 more calories when their meals came with soda, juice, sweetened tea or flavored milk, when compared to those who drank unsweetened beverages with their meals.The researchers also discovered that the children consumed an average of 82 more drink calories when the drinks were part of bundled meals than when the drinks were bought separately. Moreover, parents who bought a combo meal were 24 percent more likely to buy a high-calorie drink sweetened with sugar.The study looked at almost 500 children aged 18 and younger who ate food from McDonald's, KFC, Burger King, Subway or Wendy's in New York and New Jersey between January 2013 and June 2014. Seventy-four percent of the combo meals purchased were kids' meals. Half of the drinks were sodas , and 38 percent of them were juice, with flavored milk making up 5 percent. A further 5 percent was made up of lemonade, sweetened tea and hot chocolate. Non-sugary drinks proved to be quite unpopular, with regular milk accounting for just 2 percent and water a measly 1 percent.Dr. Brian Elbel of NYU Langone, the study's senior investigator, said: ""Our study strongly suggests that uncoupling sugary drinks from combo meal deals might reduce high-calorie beverage consumption and help to curb childhood obesity rates fueled by these kinds of liquid calories."" Parents need to take responsibility Combo meals tend to appeal to big families, which can find their bills quickly adding up at fast food restaurants. Well-meaning parents who might not normally allow their children to drink sugary beverages sometimes find themselves giving in when the drink is included.Although the practice on the part of fast food chains of bundling unhealthy foods together to create perceived value encourage unhealthy habits, it is ultimately up to the parents to decide which meals to buy for their children. Parents have the final say, and just because that super-sized Coke comes with your child's meal does not mean that you should let them drink it. Fast track to diabetes Fast food meals are already high in calories, which means that the last thing you should be doing is pairing them with high-calorie beverages. Research published in the journal Diabetes Care showed that drinking even just one sugary beverage each day raised a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 25 percent. It also upped the risk of developing metabolic syndrome by 20 percent.With around 17 percent of our nation's youth believed to be obese, there is an urgent need for poor eating habits to be curbed. Until people start giving up the convenience of the local drive-through and start making a concerted effort to feed their children clean food , the situation is only likely to get worse, and more and more children will end up obese or diabetic.So, the next time you're thinking of ordering that combo meal, keep in mind that any money that you might save on a meal deal is likely to end up costing far more in medical bills down the road.

Saturday, October 29, 2016 by: Natural News Editors Tags: Zika , mind control , propaganda (NaturalNews) It's been nearly nine months since the word ""Zika"" flashed like a lightning bolt in the headlines of mainstream news. Before January 1, 2016, Zika was just one of many viruses that public health officials monitored. But suddenly in January of this year everything changed, as a nearly harmless virus was transformed into a worldwide threat.(Article by John P. Thomas, republished from HealthImpactNews.com )As we will see, the Zika propaganda machine was turned on in October of 2015 and it has been running wild ever since. This is a classic example of a mind control program, a public brainwashing project, or a high powered marketing campaign.Regardless of what you call it, it is clear that the mainstream news media, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Big Pharma, Big Chem, and both Republicans and Democrats have joined forces to sell a Zika eradication program to the people of the United States and to the rest of the world.This has been and continues to be one of the best orchestrated programs of propaganda in recent history. This article will discuss how the program started, how it has been developed, and where it is going. Zika is not a Threat to the Babies of the World Just to be absolutely clear from the beginning, there is no solid evidence that Zika is a threat to humanity. It is a minimally dangerous viral infection, which does not cause microcephaly.In the almost 70 years since the Zika virus was patented by the Rockefeller Foundation, [1] no one ever noticed any association between Zika infection of pregnant women and their babies being born with abnormally small heads or with defects in brain development. But in 2015, we were suddenly made aware of this supposed problem. This claim, based on nothing more than circumstantial evidence, was the beginning point for the propaganda campaign. A propaganda claim doesn't need to be true; it just needs to be repeated over and over again until people believe it is true.After half a year of fear and hysteria in the mainstream media, even officials in Brazil admit that Zika is an unlikely cause of their microcephaly .As reported in Nature News & Comment on July 23, 2016, an official from Brazil's ministry of health raises doubts to suggest Zika is not the only factor in the reported microcephaly surge in his country. The report stated: Zika virus has spread throughout Brazil, but extremely high rates of microcephaly have been reported only in the country's northeast. Although evidence suggests that Zika can cause microcephaly, the clustering pattern hints that other environmental, socio-economic or biological factors could be at play. ""We suspect that something more than Zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases,"" says Fatima Marinho, director of information and health analysis at Brazil's ministry of health. If that turns out to be true, it could change researchers' assessment of the risk that Zika poses to pregnant women and their children. [2] Despite this admission from Brazil, the Zika propaganda campaign is moving ahead without interruption. The campaign will not be stopped by contrary evidence about Zika and microcephaly. Zika is a Mild Viral Infection Most people who get Zika, will be completely unaware of being infected. For those who do get sick, it is similar in many ways to having a cold or a mild case of the flu. People experience fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. Infection is thought to provide lifelong immunity. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon. Deaths are rare. [3]The fact that almost no one dies from Zika infection made it a very unlikely candidate for the development of a vaccine. For those who actually feel sick from a Zika infection, they can receive comfort care and rest while their immune systems overcome the viral illness. Zika Press Releases Set the Stage for a Propaganda Campaign However, if Zika could be connected to some other horrible consequence, such as microcephaly or paralysis (Guillain-Barre syndrome) for example, then people would insist that we create a Zika vaccine and would insist that every person on planet Earth take it. They would be willing to give up basic individual freedoms for the benefit of society, which is always the goal of mind control programs.In 2015, a number of press releases and reports were released by the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and the CDC, to set the stage for the unfolding of a grand mind control project.The documents they published raised the red flag of alarm that a Zika epidemic was unfolding throughout South America and Mexico. The conventional media got excited about the epidemic when they saw the word ""microcephaly."" The prospect of large numbers of babies being born with abnormally small heads and brains was a story that would really grab the attention of their audience.The media used pictures of deformed babies to build fear in the hearts of people and to create the perception that we better watch out or Zika is going to get us and our babies! They worked really hard to instill public panic about Zika in January and February of 2016 .In the timeline that follows, you will see the word ""autochthonous."" Public Health agencies use the word autochthonous to say that an infection was locally generated. An autochthonous case of Zika is one that was acquired in the local area where a person lives. This is in contrast with a Zika infection that was acquired while visiting another region or country.I will list a few of the key points from some press releases to show how a foundation for the Zika campaign was built and how momentum was established to project the campaign into mainstream media. May 2015: Brazil confirms first autochthonous cases of Zika. [4] October 2015: Columbia confirms first autochthonous cases of Zika. [5] October 2015: Brazil reports unusually high number of babies with microcephaly. [6] November 2015: El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Suriname, and Venezuela report autochthonous Zika infection. [7] November 17, 2015: WHO calls upon member states to watch for the occurrence of microcephaly. [8] December 1, 2015: PAHO/WHO issued the first of dozens of reports, which chronicled the history of the growing Zika epidemic and warned of microcephaly. [9, 10] December 21, 2015: WHO reports autochthonous Zika infections in Honduras. [11] December 22, 2015: WHO reports autochthonous Zika infections in Panama. [12] December 31, 2015: US CDC reports autochthonous Zika infections in Puerto Rico, and makes note of microcephaly in Brazil. [13] Counting Babies with Microcephaly The mainstream media suddenly picked up on the Zika/microcephaly story in January of 2016 and began sensationalizing it. General concern was quickly transformed into alarm as officials in Brazil reported a steady increase in the number of microcephaly cases. As of January 30, 2016, they reported 4,783 cases of microcephaly and/or Central Nervous System (CNS) malformation suggestive of congenital infection. They compared this with 2001 ‚Äî 2014 data where there was an average of 163 microcephaly cases. [14]The Brazil data about the babies was poor. We didn't know their definition of microcephaly. We didn't know how many of the mothers actually tested positive for Zika. We didn't know how the data was collected. We also didn't know why there was a strong level of insistence that the only thing that could cause these birth defects was infection with the Zika virus. Propaganda campaigns always dismissed other viewpoints other than the one being promoted. They don't want an investigation of truth or a debate about the facts ‚Äì they just want belief and submission. The US Propaganda Machine Goes Public in January 2016 CDC officials begin to ponder the situation. First they say there might be an association between Zika and microcephaly, but they are far from asserting any kind of causative relationship. [15]""Good for them,"" I thought when I heard that report. But their apparent wisdom took a nosedive a minute later when the same CDC official went on to issue a travel warning to women to avoid traveling to Brazil and other South American countries if they are pregnant, think they might be pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant in the next couple years.""What did the CDC just say?"" There is no evidence of causation, and we don't even know there is even a problem, but women should stay home any way. ""Strange,"" I thought as I began to remember how the conventional media, the CDC, and the WHO hyped up the African Ebola epidemic in a similar kind of propaganda campaign just 18 months earlier. The worldwide threat of Ebola Zaire completely died out long before a vaccine could be developed, which must have been a major disappointment to Big Pharma.But this time, they have a virus that is not going to die out. This time their propaganda campaign will be much more sophisticated, and it will make major steps toward the acceptance of universal mandatory vaccination for diseases such as Zika. A False International Crisis Involving Deformed Babies Justifies Action All through January and early February of 2016, the news media provided us with a non-stop litany of stories about Zika and deformed babies. In a previous article I examined some of the headlines in the propaganda campaign.The CDC was still using the word ""possible association,"" while the news media insisted on using the word ""cause."" Despite the initial reserve of the CDC, the news media began to shout the message across America, ""Zika is going to deform the heads of our babies while they are in the womb, and there's no vaccine to protect us!""It seems like every Zika story I saw included at least one photo of a baby with microcephaly and always stated that there is no vaccine yet. We were reminded over and over again that Zika is causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads, mental retardation, and blindness. We were warned that some babies were dying at birth because of the severity of their brain deformation. We were told that each baby born with microcephaly will cost ten million dollars or more in medical expenses during the child's life. [16] These stories created ever increasing levels of apprehension and fear as they were intended to do.As the mainstream media struggled to keep the fear level high and keep the story line flowing from week to week, they began to focus in on government efforts to save us from Zika. It didn't take long for them to find people to interview who would ask the question they wanted asked. ""What is the Government Going to Do to Protect Our Babies?"" This question was asked over and over again even though there was no proof that Zika infection and microcephaly were related. The question was asked so many times by the media that no politician could dare to say, ""I am not going to do anything, because as far as we know Zika doesn't cause microcephaly."" President Obama Responds to the Question On February 22, 2016, President Obama requested 1.9 billion dollars to study the situation and to develop a Zika vaccine. [17]Let's look at this more carefully. We are going to spend 1.9 billion dollars to develop a vaccine for a virus that almost never kills anyone and has not been proven to cause birth defects ‚Äî just to be safe. Or is something else going on here?Perhaps the real story is that Big Pharma wants another cash cow vaccine and the Zika threat has been promoted in such a way that people will insist that Big Pharma develop a Zika vaccine for us. Suddenly, Big Pharma companies will be able to put on their white hats and rescue all the babies of the world. This would be such sweet deception if they could pull it off. CDC Declaration: Zika Causes Microcephaly The CDC announced in April of 2016 that Zika causes microcephaly. [18]This decision was based on a CDC analysis of available data. They did not conduct comprehensive research. They used a quacking duck kind of analysis. If it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck then it must be a duck. They couldn't tell if it had feathers like a duck or has a bill like a duck, but they still insisted on calling it a duck named Zika. In doing this, they ignored some of the most important criteria in their analysis.CDC researchers stated: The seventh [of Shepard's] criterion, proof in an experimental system that the agent acts in an unaltered state, is aimed at medications or chemical exposures and does not apply to infectious agents. Thus, given Shepard's criteria as a framework, criteria 1, 3, and 4 have been satisfied ‚Äî evidence that is considered sufficient to identify an agent as a teratogen. [19] In other words, they used a set of seven criteria to determine whether Zika could be considered to be a cause of microcephaly. They determined that the association between Zika infection and microcephaly was causative for 3 of the 7 criteria. They suggested that additional study was needed before 3 of the other criteria could be met. They excluded the seventh criteria altogether, because it examined whether medications or chemicals might have caused microcephaly.I couldn't believe that they excluded the seventh criteria when it is clear that microcephaly is known to be caused by pesticide exposure, and could just as easily be caused by vaccinations during pregnancy as it was likely to be caused by Zika infection.These CDC scientists were only looking for causation from infectious agents. Nothing else seemed to matter. This exclusionary mindset was present since the very beginning of the Zika propaganda campaign.They ignored the effect of the Tdap vaccine given to pregnant women in Brazil in 2015. They ignored the side effects of medications. They ignored the consumption of GMO food, glyphosate, and Pyriproxyfen that were widely used in Brazil. They ignored chemical exposure from Brazil's large chemical manufacturing facilities. They ignored alcohol and drug use. They ignored the effects of extreme multi-generational nutritional deficiencies and extreme poverty. They ignored the introduction of genetically modified mosquitoes that were released in Brazil. They ignored exposure to rubella, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus. They ignored the combined effects of all these factors as well as multigenerational modifications to the local gene pool from these potential causes.I discussed these potential causes of microcephaly in my first article on Zika, published in January of 2016.There is one key point that I want to bring forward from the previous article concerning the number of babies born with microcephaly. First we heard that there were some 4,783 cases of microcephaly in Brazil. After the initial shock and panic was produced, we learned that further investigation showed that the number of confirmed cases was only 483.The mainstream media also didn't mention that the number of babies born in the United States with microcephaly in a typical year is 25,000. When adjusting for population differences between the US and Brazil, we find that the rate of microcephaly in the US is actually 40 times higher than the rate in Brazil.In other words, the US microcephaly incidence is much higher than Brazil, and our babies didn't get it from Zika. Maybe our babies got it from the various potential causes I discussed in my previous article.I should also state that the researchers who put their names on this article are all employees of the CDC. [20] I must question whether their analysis was truly objective and whether their findings were influenced by CDC ties to Big Pharma. The Zika Vaccine is in the Pipeline Based on this single poor quality analysis, it's full speed ahead for developing a Zika vaccine. There are at least four companies plus the CDC working on a Zika vaccine. We are told that it will still take several years before a Zika vaccine can be properly tested and made available in large quantities for the population of the world.Zika vaccine trials have already begun and they are already recruiting volunteers in the US. The US National Institutes of Health hopes to start phase II trials of its vaccine in early 2017. [22] Congress Tries to Protect Our Babies with Zika Funding Now that the CDC has settled the Zika-microcephaly question, it was time to get congress to fund the President's request for a Zika vaccine development program. The House and the Senate passed Zika funding bills. However, they have different ideas of how much money should be spent and how the funds should be generated. The funding process stalled at the end of June when the Senate and House could not reconcile their differences. [23]Congress went on a seven week summer vacation, and wasn't available to try to resolve their differences. This created a problem for the Zika mind control campaign, because it might mean there would be no new Zika news to report during the summer. Keeping the Propaganda Campaign Going by Killing Mosquitoes The mainstream media switched their focus from vaccine development to eradication of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is known to carry the Zika virus. If an infected mosquito bites a person, then the person might develop the infection. This is a fact that no one is disputing. The Great Mosquito Chase of 2016 The CDC continues to count the number of Zika cases in the US and Puerto Rico. The numbers continue to rise through the spring and early summer. They were looking for autochthonous cases of Zika in the US, but they could only find infected people who had traveled to Zika infected countries or who had sex with people who traveled to those countries.Finally, at the very end of July, 4 people in the Wynnewood section of Miami, Florida, were found to have Zika even though they had not traveled to a Zika infected country or had sex with a Zika infected person. [24]Public health officials at the state and federal level interpreted the presence of these cases to mean that Zika must have been transmitted to these people by mosquito bites. They ignored the possibility that the infected people might have been lying about their exposure, for example, having sexual contact with an infected person. Nevertheless, officials concluded that they must implement a strong mosquito control program to prevent Zika from spreading any further.Now that the Zika epidemic was on US home soil; the media had another fear inducing story to add to their propaganda campaign. ""There are mosquitoes that are out to get you and our babies!"" The Governor of Florida Goes Door to Door to Find more People with Zika On August 1st, the governor of Florida contacted the US public health system and asked them to send a specially trained squad of federal public health agents to help with the Zika emergency in Miami. These agents and Florida officials went door to door in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami and collected urine samples to identify additional cases of Zika.10 more cases were found, but all were asymptomatic ‚Äì the people didn't even know they were infected. [25] Problem ‚Äî They can't find a Zika Infected Mosquito 5,000 mosquitoes were tested for the presence of Zika, but all tests were negative. [26]Officials dismiss the negative infection results by saying that finding a Zika infected mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack. [27] Aerial Mosquito Spraying Program Initiated The governor of Florida in conjunction with federal public health agents decided that they needed to do aerial spraying of pesticide. Even though the Aedes aegypti mosquito wouldn't travel more than 300 feet from its birth place in the Wynwood neighborhood where the autochthonous Zika cases were located, the officials decided to spray a ten square mile area just to be safe. [28]A spraying program that covers ten square miles would make a sensational story in the media. It would be much more alarming than a story about a neighborhood aerial spray zone. It also would expose many more people to a toxic pesticide (more about that later).The first aerial spraying took place on August 4, 2016. [29] Toxic Pesticide Used in Aerial Spraying Causes Microcephaly Officials told the public not to worry about the pesticide that was being sprayed, because it (naled) is harmless. They pointed to EPA reports, which supported their claim. [30]They didn't mention that naled was banned in Europe in 2005. They didn't mention that officials in Puerto Rico recently refused to allow the spraying of naled over their citizens. They didn't mention that naled kills many other types of insects and aquatic creatures in addition to mosquitoes. [31] Most importantly, official didn't mention that naled and the chemicals that are created when it breaks down in the environment have the potential for causing human birth defects. [32] Could Pesticide Naled Cause Microcephaly and other Life Threatening Diseases? Officials didn't mention that the pesticide that they were spraying over the densely populated minority neighborhood of Wynwood [33] was particularly dangerous for babies in the womb.This is what the JOURNAL OF PESTICIDE REFORM has to say about naled: Like all organophosphates, naled [Dibrom] is toxic to the nervous system. Symptoms of exposure include headaches, nausea, and diarrhea. Naled is more toxic when exposure occurs by breathing contaminated air than through other kinds of exposure. In laboratory tests, naled exposure caused increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning. Naled's breakdown product dichlorvos (another organophosphate insecticide) interferes with prenatal brain development. In laboratory animals, exposure for just 3 days during pregnancy when the brain is growing quickly reduced brain size 15 percent. Dichlorvos also causes cancer, according to the International Agency for Research on Carcinogens. In laboratory tests, it caused leukemia and pancreatic cancer. Two independent studies have shown that children exposed to household ""no-pest"" strips containing dichlorvos have a higher incidence of brain cancer than unexposed children. [34] [Emphasis added] Naled exposure causes increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning. These are some of the symptoms that are also found in children on the autism spectrum.One of the most toxic break down products in Naled is Dichlorvos. This chemical caused a 15% reduction in brain size in pregnant lab animals after 3 days of exposure. Another word for reduced brain size is microcephaly.So, the pesticide they are spraying could increase the rate of autism among children in the spray zone, and could cause microcephaly to occur in the babies of pregnant women.Question: If there are babies born in Miami with microcephaly in the next nine months or if the autism rate in the spray zone increases, will we blame Zika or Naled? I am sure that no one from the CDC or from a public health agency will ever point a finger at Naled. They will use the children to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Zika is to blame. Naled is also Harmful to Adults Dr. Naresh Kumar, a Professor of Public Health at the University of Miami, commented about the risks of using pesticides in aerial spraying. His statement came from CBS Miami: ""All are a neurotoxin, meaning it will directly affect our nervous system."" ""It will affect not only the pregnant woman ... it is also equally for children who have asthma and airway disease because when you are spraying in the air, these aerosols stay in the air for at least five days."" [35] The Miami Herald provided this advice to people in the pesticide spray zone. They stated: The agency [EPA] says the insecticide poses no risk for the majority of people, but those sensitive to chemicals may want to stay inside during spraying, close windows and turn off window air conditioners. Fruits and vegetables should also be washed before eating and outdoor furniture and grills covered. [36] So, if you are concerned about being exposed to the chemicals they are spraying, then you should stay inside for 5 days until the pesticide falls out of the air. You should keep your windows closed, and turn off window air conditioners. I wonder how many people were able to follow this advice in the subtropical urban climate of Miami in August.Mind control programs always try to make life difficult for those who live outside the box of normality. They want us to follow their instructions, which in this case would be to just not worry about the spraying. If you are concerned, then you can take their ridiculous suggestions, which won't really protect you from the spray. Does Zika also Cause Guillain-Barre Syndrome? Apparently the CDC suspects that Zika causes the paralytic syndrome called Guillain-Barre. If you look at the data collection forms for monitoring Zika in the US you will see another masterful stroke of mind control in the making. They are counting cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome on the same form with cases of Zika. [37]Why would the CDC try to make this connection? The CDC indicates on their Guillain-Barre Syndrome page that they are not sure what causes this syndrome. They do mention that there were some cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome associated with the swine flu vaccine in 1976, but otherwise the condition is rare with unknown etiology. [38]If they can make a case for the Zika virus being the cause of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, then they will shift attention away from the fact that many vaccines and pesticides have a harmful effect on the human nervous system and are able to produce this type of paralysis.I anticipate seeing a Guillain-Barre Syndrome research paper just like the one produced by the CDC on microcephaly. Their new paper will just substitute the phrase ""Guillain-Barre Syndrome,"" for the word ""microcephaly."" They will show through statistical smoke and mirrors that the Zika virus is causative for Guillain-Barre Syndrome as well as microcephaly.If they can pull this off, then the Zika virus will be blamed for all cases of vaccine damage in which microcephaly or paralysis results. If they can pull this off, and I suspect they will, then pesticide manufacturers will also be able to blame the Zika virus for microcephaly, neurological malformation, and paralysis that results from the use of their products. The Zika virus will be the perfect scapegoat. The List of Birth Defects Being Blamed on Zika with No Evidence is Increasing Propaganda campaigns always seek to worsen the devastating effects of whatever they want us to fear. First we heard that Zika causes microcephaly. Then we heard that it might also cause Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Now we are hearing that Zika causes a whole host of other birth defects, some of which might not appear until months or even years after birth.The New York Times stated: The images [of babies with microcephaly], published Tuesday in the journal Radiology, also suggest a grim possibility: Because some of the damage was seen in brain areas that continue to develop after birth, it may be that babies born without obvious impairment will experience problems as they grow. Images of another baby girl show contracted hands and arms, the result of another common symptom. Zika seems to damage the nerves in a developing fetus so that sometimes ""muscles aren't developing normally because they don't have the nerve impulses to move normally,"" she [Dr. Levine] said. With such a vicious and unpredictable virus, ""it's key to realize that Zika is more than microcephaly, that there's a number of other abnormalities as they've shown in this paper, and its effects are going to be even more broad,"" said Dr. Spong, whose agency has begun a study of what will ultimately be 10,000 babies born in Zika epidemic areas including Brazil and Puerto Rico. ""It's going to be essential to follow them to look at their development, to look at their ability to learn, to look at hearing problems, balance problems, behavior problems, all those issues, to make sure that we don't miss anyone."" [39] Zika: The New Scapegoat for All Childhood Diseases? Can you tell where this is going? It seems to me that they are planning to put together a catalog of major injuries that results from Zika infection.It will include most if not all injuries that result from vaccines, pesticides, GMO food, pharmaceutical drugs, the high-carbohydrate low-fat standard American diet, and anything else that might lead to a successful lawsuit against Big Pharma or Big Chem. Zika might just become the standard defense for suit against corporations. ""It wasn't our product that harmed this little baby, it was Zika!"" Conclusion: Another Government Tool for ""The Greater Good"" to Strip Away Freedoms? It won't be long before the mainstream media will be showing us pictures of US babies from Florida who were born with microcephaly. The mainstream media will tug at our heartstrings and will remind us that this horror will soon become preventable when the Zika vaccine is developed.We will hear about more and more connections between Zika and other terrible health conditions experienced by children. We will be told that all this suffering and all this expense will be avoided when all the mosquitoes are killed and everyone receives the Zika vaccine.Mind control programs always talk about the greater good and how individuals must give up their individual freedoms, their rights, and even their preferences for the sake of the collective benefit. Zika will be one of the tools used by mind controllers and the ruling elite to move us toward mass vaccination and total government control over our lives.Read more at: HealthImpactNews.com [1] ""Zika Virus is property of Rockefeller Foundation,"" Feb 7, 2016 Anonews.co [2] ""Brazil asks whether Zika acts alone to cause birth defects"" July 25, 2016 Nature.com [3] ""First case of Zika virus reported in Puerto Rico"" Dec 31, 2015 CDC.gov [4] ""Epidemiological Alert ‚Äì Neurological syndrome, congenital malformations, and Zika virus infection ‚Äì Implications for Public Health in the Americas"" Dec 1, 2015 Paho.org [5] IBID.[7] IBID.[8] ""Epidemiological Alert Increase of microcephaly in the northeast of Brazil"" Nov 17, 2015 Paho.org [9] ""Epidemiological Alert ‚Äì Neurological syndrome, congenital malformations, and Zika virus infection ‚Äì Implications for Public Health in the Americas"" Dec 1, 2015 Paho.org [10] ""Archive by Disease ‚Äì Zika virus infection"" Paho.org [11] ""Zika virus infection ‚Äì Honduras"" Dec 21, 2015 Who.int [12] ""Zika virus infection ‚Äì Panama"" Dec 22, 2015 Who.int [13] ""First case of Zika virus reported in Puerto Rico"" Dec 31, 2015 CDC.gov [14] ""PAHO WHO Reported increase of congenital microcephaly and other central nervous system symptoms"" February 10, 2016 Paho.org [15] ""Why is Zika virus spreading so quickly?""

Friday, October 28, 2016 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: breast cancer , mammography , harming women (NaturalNews) Every year, millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms, a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a woman's breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors. But surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice , which studies show isn't even an effective screening tool, and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive it.The public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early, but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure, found that mammography is neither effective nor safe. After looking at data on more than 600,000 women between the ages of 39 and 74 who underwent the procedure on a routine basis, researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed. Many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy , resulting in their rapid demise.As published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good , because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer. Thus, the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments, and not at the forefront of women's medicine.""If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women , who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily,"" the authors concluded. Group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good One year after this review was published, a second one published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) came to a similar conclusion. A team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist, a clinical epidemiologist, a pharmacologist, an oncologic surgeon, a nurse scientist, a lawyer and a health economist, decided that the medical industry's claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunk.They found that for every 1,000 women screened in the U.S. over a 10-year annual screening period beginning at age 50, one breast cancer death would be prevented, while a shocking 490 to 670 women would have a false positive, while 70 to 100 would undergo an unnecessary biopsy. Between three and 14 of these women, the study found, would also be over-diagnosed for a non-malignant form of cancer that never even would have become ""clinically apparent.""This study out of Switzerland corroborates another out of Canada ‚Äì the 2014 Canadian National Breast Screening Study ‚Äì which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination. In other words, the procedure is completely unnecessary, and in many cases exceptionally harmful .And on and on the list goes, with data out of Norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isn't all that it's cracked up to be. U.S. data spanning the course of nearly 40 years shows that more women are over- or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully early-diagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization. This represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesn't work.""I believe that if you did have a tumor, the last thing you would want to do is crush that tumor between two plates, because that would spread it,"" says general practitioner Dr. Sarah Mybill, as quoted in the documentary film The Promise .

Sunday, October 30, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: shrimp imports , chemical injections , food fraud (NaturalNews) It seems that the more advanced human civilization becomes, the less we learn about what is and isn't good for our bodies. That's the only way to explain why many commercial food operations are so toxic and hazardous to our health.The UK's Daily Mail is reporting on a commercial shrimp operation in Vietnam where workers have been videotaped injecting them with disgusting gel-like substances in order to make them appear bigger and fresher before they are sold and exported.The video shows factory workers injecting tiger prawns (shrimp) in the head, tail and midsection with a gel substance to make them heavier before they are sold.Vietnam is the largest source of imported shrimp for many countries.The video footage was shot by a Vietnamese television station earlier this year. Since surfacing, it has gone viral online on social media sites like Facebook, with many people expressing disgust and outrage.The substance is often used in food as a thickening agent, in particular for icing. But many people who have watched the video are labeling the Vietnamese factory and its workers as ""shameless"" and dishonest in their attempt to make the shrimp appear bigger and more meaty. In addition, the practice makes one wonder what else is being done to shrimp or other food products, not just in Vietnam, but throughout the region. 'All local shrimp suppliers do this' Environmental protection organization Greenpeace recently released a report titled, ""Dodgy Prawns,"" as an aid for importers of shrimp to find sources that are harvested without using slave labor, methods that are destructive or harmful to ocean ecosystems, or that utilize toxic chemicals.The guide recommended shrimp harvested in and around Australia, but also ""ecologically certified"" black tiger prawns from Vietnam. The organization also warned against all imported vannamei, which very often is sourced from Vietnam, because of concern about mangrove destruction, pollution and the use of invasive species. Natural Blaze , in reporting on the story , noted that workers at the Vietnam shrimp preparation factory in question said they injected the shrimp there because ""all local shrimp suppliers do this.""The site noted further that the largest suppliers of shrimp products in Vietnam import more than half of their raw materials for processing from other countries, including China, which has a well-deserved reputation for unclean, unsanitary food production.In the U.S., about 100 million pounds of shrimp ‚Äì or about 8 percent of the amount of shrimp Americans consume annually ‚Äì comes from Vietnam, which in turn gets most of its shrimp from China, where food regulation is a cruel joke. Added weight means additional profits Natural Blaze reported that after about $150 million worth of shrimp was imported into the U.S. from China between January and October 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an import alert in December of that year. The alert warned importers of the ""presence of new animals' drugs and/or unsafe food additives"" in seafood originating in China, and that included shrimp.The Daily Mail said that workers were injecting the shrimp with a substance known as carboxymethyl cellulose, or CMC. Many say it is not considered harmful because it dissolves in water and becomes a smooth liquid before it is then pumped into the shrimp.But obviously CMC is not a naturally-occurring element either, which means shrimp that it is injected into are no longer organic and natural . And the substance has been linked to diarrhea, abdominal cramps, eye pain and irritation, and lingering changes in vision, Natural Blaze noted.And yet its use in food continues. That's because wholesalers and retailers see a bigger profit margin in artificially inflating the size of shrimp that is then sold by weight. And even if retailers aren't doing the injecting, they are knowingly selling a product that has been injected at the source.

Sunday, October 30, 2016 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: superbugs , antibiotics abuse , Big Pharma (NaturalNews) As new guidelines set forth by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to curb antibiotic overuse and abuse on factory farms slowly come into effect, the drug industry is apparently setting its greedy sights elsewhere ‚Äì towards countries where restrictions on antibiotic use are looser, or simply where ""anything goes.""Livestock are the single biggest consumers of antibiotic drugs in the U.S. ‚Äì not by choice, of course, but because farmers have long been sold a bill of goods by Big Pharma when it comes to using them to bulk up their cattle more quickly and get them to market as fast as possible. It's a common practice that generates a lot of money in the short-term, but a whole lot of problems in the long-term.The use of antibiotics on farms is arguably the biggest contributor to antibiotic resistance among humans, where drugs that used to treat deadly bugs no longer do. The result is the emergence of so-called ""superbugs"" that are capable of outsmarting even the most potent antibiotics, a phenomenon that's killing people by the hundreds of thousands.Some of the latest reports indicate that the superbug epidemic is claiming the lives of some 700,000 people annually all around the world. And if nothing is done now to stop the drug industry from continuing to poison the well, so to speak, then this number is expected to balloon more than 14-fold to 10 million lives lost by the year 2050.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are very few countries in the world with any sort of formidable plan in place to address antibiotic resistance. Even with the U.S. somewhat taking the lead with voluntary FDA suggestions on the matter, none of this will stop drug companies from preying on the developing world that has yet to enact any sort of restrictions on antibiotic use.""They're international companies,"" Gail Hansen, a veterinarian and consultant who works with drug companies, governments and nonprofit organizations, told Bloomberg . ""What happens in the U.S. does certainly make a difference, but it's not the only market they have."" Antibiotic resistance kills 10 times more people than opiate overdoses While it's become common practice for factory animal rearers to exploit antibiotics as a way to fatten their stocks more quickly and supposedly keep them healthy, the use of these drugs for such purposes is disastrous for public health. Comparatively speaking, only 69,000 people die from opiate overdoses globally, which translates to 10 times more people dying from superbugs than from the most deadly pharmaceuticals on the market.Antibiotics are also overused in the realm of human medicine, with some one-third of all prescriptions, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Pew Charitable Trusts, being completely unnecessary. This translates to roughly 47 million prescriptions that aren't even helpful, either because the patients have a viral infection, or don't have an infection at all.The only way anything is going to change is if Big Pharma is barred from selling antibiotics to farmers whose only desire is to rush their animals to market for maximum profits. Doctors must also be reigned in and stopped from indiscriminately handing out antibiotics whenever their patients feel any kind of ailment ‚Äì and again, these measures must have a global reach.""If some of the biggest responsible parties ‚Äì namely the companies making the products ‚Äì are still selling the antibiotics in other countries, it just underscores that this has to be a change that happens across the entire world,"" David Wallinga, a senior health official and physician at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), told Bloomberg .""And the companies bear a big responsibility for that approach.""

Sunday, October 30, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: tainted food , organic label , China (NaturalNews) The Chinese food production industry is one of the world's least-regulated and most corrupt, as has repeatedly been proven time and again. Now, it appears, there is no trusting anything that comes from China marked ""organic."" Natural Health 365 reports that several foods within the country are so contaminated that Chinese citizens don't trust them. What's more, the countries that import these tainted foods are putting their citizens at risk.U.S. Customs personnel often turn away food shipments from China because they contain unsavory additives and drug residues, are mislabeled, or are just generally filthy. Some Chinese food exporters have responded by labeling their products ""organic,"" though they are far from it.There are several factors at play which make Chinese claims of organic unreliable. First, environmental pollution from unrestrained and unregulated industrial growth has so polluted soil and waterways with toxic heavy metals that nothing grown in them is safe, much less organic. Also, there is so much fraudulent labeling and rampant corruption within the government and manufacturing sectors that it's not smart to trust what is put on packaging.In fact, farmers in China use water that is replete with heavy metals, Natural Health 365 noted in a separate report . In addition, water used for irrigation also contains organic and inorganic substances and pollutants. Chinese ""organic"" food is so contaminated that a person could get ill just by handling some of it. 'Dirty water' is all there is The report noted further:""This is reality ‚Äì all of China's grains, vegetables and fruits are irrigated with untreated industrial wastewater. The Yellow River, which is considered unusable, supports major food producing areas in the northeast provinces.""Many Chinese farmers won't even eat the food they produce, if you can believe that. That's because it's clear that China's water pollution issues are so pronounced that it threatens the country's entire food supply .Chinese farmers have said there is no available water for crops except "" dirty water ."" As part of the country's industrial prowess, it is also one of the largest producers (and consumers) of fertilizers and pesticides, Water Politics reported.The site noted further that as China's industrial might grows, so too does the level of contaminants in the country's water supply. Lakes, rivers, streams and falling water tables are becoming more polluted by the year.In addition to man-made pollutants, animals produce about 90 percent of the organic pollutants and half of the nitrogen in China's water , say experts at the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning. There are times when water is so polluted it turns black ‚Äì yet it is still used to irrigate crops, and of course, that affects so-called organic farming operations as well.These nine foods are particularly vulnerable to becoming tainted, Natural Health 365 noted: Fish: Some 80 percent of the tilapia sold in the U.S. come from fish farms in China , as well as half the cod. Water pollution in China is a horrible problem, so any fish grown there are suspect. Chicken: Poultry produced in China is very often plagued with illnesses like avian flu. Apples and apple juice: Only recently has the U.S. moved to allow the importation of Chinese apples, though American producers grow plenty for the country and the world. Rice: Though this is a staple in China and much of the rice in the U.S. comes from there, some of it has been found to be made of resin and potato. Mushrooms: Some 34 percent of processed mushrooms come from China. Salt: Some salt produced in China for industrial uses has made its way to American dinner tables. Black pepper: One Chinese vendor was trying to pass off mud flakes as pepper. Green peas: Phony peas have been found in China made of soy, green dye and other questionable substances. Garlic: About one-third of all garlic in the U.S. comes from China.Shop wisely.";english;2016-10-30T21:57:47.483+02:00;naturalnews.com;US;6416.0;Contaminated food from China now entering the U.S. under the 'organic' label;0.0;http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/640/Locations/China-Map-Close-Up-Country.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;junksci

Sunday, October 30, 2016 by: Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: Herculex , Yield Guard , crop failures (NaturalNews) The utter failure of genetically-modified crops (GMOs) is once again on full display, this time with crop products made by companies other than the usual Monsanto . A novel variety of transgenic corn produced and marketed by both Dow Chemical Corporation and DuPont is not exactly working as claimed, new reports indicate, and agricultural experts are urging the chemical industry to immediately cease selling these failed products to farmers.Known as ""Herculex,"" the synthetic corn in question contains a gene modification that's supposed to prevent a pest known as the western bean cutworm from destroying crops. But so far, the genetic alteration has done nothing to stop this worm, which means farmers everywhere have been paying through their teeth for a technology that not only doesn't work , but that's also proprietary and exceptionally costly, especially when compared to non-GMO and organic crops that are open-source, and are not patented or owned by multi-national corporations.A group of six entomologists published an open letter to the seed industry in a recent issue of Purdue University's Pest & Crop Newsletter , calling on those involved to do the right thing and fess up to the fact that Herculex doesn't work. Farmers will soon be gearing up to plant next year's crops, and they need to know that it's best to look elsewhere for corn that's not going to result in massive yield reductions.""People are frustrated and angry and, more importantly, yield was lost,"" the letter states. ""Before growers make seed choices for 2017, we again urge the seed industry to acknowledge the reality of what is happening in the field."" DuPont quietly admits Herculex doesn't work, but refuses to take responsibility In typical corporate fashion, the owners of Herculex are refusing to take the letter seriously, resorting instead to excuses and legal speak to try to explain away the GM crop's failure. Rather than pull the Herculex product from the market, DuPont, according to Bloomberg , has instead decided to merely decreased its efficiency rating in the company's 2017 Product Use Guide from ""very good"" to ""moderate.""DuPont has also issued an accompanying statement urging farmers to add other inputs to try to control cutworms, including spraying additional chemical insecticides. In other words, Herculex doesn't actually work, and DuPont's solution is to have farmers just go ahead and blast away with all those endocrine-disrupting, cancer-causing chemicals to kill anything and everything that might be living on or around the crop .It's basically the same advice that Monsanto is giving to farmers who foolishly adopted a similar GM corn product known as ""YieldGard"" that was supposed to deter the western corn root worm. The insecticidal proteins in this crop product, just like the one in Herculex ‚Äì known as Cry1F ‚Äì haven't lived up to all the wild marketing claims, and yet both Monsanto and DuPont's products continue to be sold to farmers.""Cry1F has failed in our states,"" the letter continues, adding that the scientists involved have already received dozens of calls and emails about the problem from concerned farmers. ""For growers in our states, the costs of scouting and spraying Cry1F corn negates a major reason they purchased and planted a hybrid with the trait in the first place.""If left to run their course, western bean cutworms and western corn root rooms will effectively eat up all the corn kernels and leave the plant defenseless, encouraging the growth of harmful fungi and mycotoxins. And since none of what the chemical industry has proposed as a solution is working, their only recommended option is to spray more glyphosate, dicamba, 2,4-D and other chemicals on their products.

Sunday, October 30, 2016 by: David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags: cancer prevention , onions , quercetin (NaturalNews) A chemical naturally occurring in onions may be able to suppress the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, and perhaps even initiate cancer cell death, according to a study conducted by researchers from Kumamoto University in Japan, and published in the journal Scientific Reports .These particular anticancer effects come from a chemical called onionin A (ONA). The study focused on the effects of ONA on the most common form of ovarian cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). This type of cancer has a five-year survival rate of only 40 percent. It is the 10th most common female cancer in the United States, and the fifth most lethal form of cancer in women. As many as 80 percent of EOC patients relapse after their first course of chemotherapy. Kills cancer cells, suppresses tumor growth In a prior study, the researchers found that ONA suppressed the tumor-promoting activity of a type of white blood cells known as myeloid cells.In the new study, researchers further examined cell-based models of EOCs. Firstly, they found that the introduction of ONA caused EOC tumor growth to slow. Further examination showed that ONA was inhibiting the tumor-boosting activities of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), thereby confirming the findings of the prior study.Previous research has suggested that in the presence of cancer, MDSCs may function to suppress anti-tumor activity by the rest of the immune system.The researchers also found that when combined with anti-cancer drugs, ONA boosted the ability of the drugs to block cancer proliferation.""We found that ONA reduced the extent of ovarian cancer cell proliferation induced by co-culture with human macrophages,"" the researchers wrote. ""In addition, we found that ONA directly suppressed cancer cell proliferation.""The researchers then performed an additional experiment, giving mice with EOC oral treatment with ONA and comparing them with a control group. They found that the mice given ONA lived longer, and their tumors did not grow as aggressively. No side effects were observed from the treatment.The researchers concluded that with some additional testing, ONA could be used as an oral cancer treatment.""ONA is considered useful for the additional treatment of patients with ovarian cancer owing to its suppression of the pro-tumor activation of [tumor-associated macrophages] and direct cytotoxicity against cancer cells,"" they wrote.Studies have also linked onions to a lower risk of stomach and colorectal cancers. The overlooked superfood Scientists continue to uncover remarkable health benefits of the humble onion, which is a staple food in every culture in which it is found.The benefits of onions start simply with their nutrient profile: These vegetables are highly nutrient dense, delivering high levels of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, with relatively few calories. A single cup of chopped onions contains 10 percent or more of the daily recommended amount of vitamin B6, vitamin C and manganese, and also contains calcium, folate, iron, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium. In addition to vitamin C, onions are high in other antioxidants, particularly quercetin . Antioxidants help protect the body from free radicals that cause chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.Researchers attribute many of onions' health benefits to quercetin, including lower blood pressure and improved cardiovascular health. Quercetin is also a potent anti-inflammatory.Other benefits of onions may stem from some of the other nutrients it contains. Studies have shown that onions can help fight depression, an effect that may come in part from their high folate content. Folate helps prevent a buildup in the body of homocysteine, which in turn can suppress the production of mood-regulating neurotransmitters. Excess homocysteine can also interfere with sleep and appetite.Onions are a versatile food. The entire plant is edible (except for the small roots), and can be eaten in nearly any form. It can be cooked into recipes, added raw on top of salads or sandwiches, or used as an ingredient in dips and sauces.

Sunday, October 30, 2016 by: David Gutierrez, staff writer (NaturalNews) Inexpensive, nontoxic, versatile and potent: Hydrogen peroxide is a wonder product that belongs in every home.Hydrogen peroxide is widely known as a disinfectant for minor cuts and scrapes, but many people don't understand that it works simply by oxidizing microbes to death. Hydrogen peroxide is simply water with an extra oxygen atom attached; in this unstable form, the oxygen breaks off from the water and forms a free radical solution that is highly reactive. But once it has reacted, the only byproducts are non-reactive oxygen and water. This is why, when used properly, hydrogen peroxide is so safe.Hydrogen peroxide is so safe and effective that our own immune systems actually generate it as the first line of defense against microbes as diverse as bacteria, viruses, yeast and parasites. In this context, it also appears to act as an anti-inflammatory. Natural remedies So how can you make hydrogen peroxide work for you? Unsurprisingly, many of this product's greatest uses are as natural cures or for some other health-promoting function. For example, a nasal spray made from one tablespoon of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide in a cup of non-chlorinated water can be an effective treatment for sinus infections. Toothaches caused by minor infection can be treated with a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash; the same mouthwash can also remove bad breath.If you think you're coming down with a cold, stave it off by placing a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in your ears each morning.Hydrogen peroxide is also a potent anti-fungal. A 50‚Äì50 mix of hydrogen peroxide and water, sprayed on the feet every night and allowed to dry, is a good way to get rid of athlete's foot and other fungal infections. A similar (but much more diluted) cure can be used on plants suffering from fungus; in this case, dissolve half a cup of hydrogen peroxide in a gallon of water and spray on the affected plant. Replace your cosmetics! You can also get lots of use from hydrogen peroxide around the home. Mixed with baking soda, it makes a great toothpaste. It can also be used to protect water that you expect to be standing for a while, such as that in a humidifier or steamer ‚Äì a pint of hydrogen peroxide mixed in will prevent microbial growth. Similarly, you can use hydrogen peroxide as a toilet bowl cleaner; let it sit for 20 minutes and then scrub.When properly diluted, hydrogen peroxide can detox your skin by stripping away harmful environmental toxins. Just mix 2 quarts of hydrogen peroxide into a full bathtub and soak for half an hour or more.Other cosmetic uses of hydrogen peroxide include cleaning your contact lenses ‚Äì it denatures proteins that build up on the lenses ‚Äì or helping to remove ear wax buildup. A few drops in the ears, followed by a few drops of olive oil, will cause earwax to break up and drain out.Hydrogen peroxide can also be used as a safer, gentler alternative to bleach for lightening your hair. Household uses Hydrogen peroxide isn't just for your body; it can also be for your dog's! Hydrogen peroxide can induce rapid vomiting in dogs that have swallowed dangerous objects. Vomiting should only be induced upon a vet's recommendation, however.Finally, hydrogen peroxide can be great for your clothing. Use it instead of bleach to whiten your laundry. More carefully applied, it can take out organic stains by breaking apart the proteins causing the discoloration. This is particularly effective with blood.Use caution when applying hydrogen peroxide directly to clothing, as it may bleach or discolor some fabrics. But if you have a fresh, organic stain, you should be fine if you pour on just a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, wait a few minutes (it should foam), and then rinse it off with cold water and soap.

Saturday, October 29, 2016 by: Amy Goodrich Tags: cinnamon , intelligence , Parkinsons disease (NaturalNews) Cinnamon is one of the world's most consumed spices. For thousands of years, it has been prized for its medicinal properties and sweet, warming taste. Aside from sprinkling cinnamon on top of your lattes or adding magic to grandma's apple pie, researchers have found that consuming this tasty household spice also might enhance learning skills.Scientists at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago found that increased ingestion of cinnamon significantly improved the memory of ""poor learning"" mice. Recently, their findings were published in the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology in an article entitled ""Cinnamon Converts Poor Learning Mice to Good Learners: Implications for Memory Improvement.""The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Alzheimer's Association. How cinnamon affects the brain For the study, lead researcher Kalipada Pahan, a neurology professor at Rush University Medical Center, and his team zoomed in on two key proteins, GABRA5 and CREB, located in the hippocampus region of the brain. The hippocampus is a small part of the brain that generates, organizes, and stores memory. Previous research has shown that lower levels of CREB and higher levels of GABRA5 occur in the brain of poor learners.To see if ground cinnamon could improve the memory of slow learners, the researchers took a group of mice and placed them in a maze with 20 holes. The experiment was focused on watching the mice learn how to locate their target hole.When they tested the mice again after one month of cinnamon feeding, the researchers found that the mice determined to be poor learners had significantly improved their memory and learning skills. They could find their target hole twice as fast.Pahan and his team explained that when cinnamon is ingested the body converts it into sodium benzoate, a chemical compound used to treat brain damage. Furthermore, they discovered that when benzoate entered the mice's brains, it increased CREB, decreased GABRA5, and stimulated hippocampal neurons, which led to improved memory and learning skills.""We have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical, cellular and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning,"" Pahan said.However, no significant improvements were seen in the mice that were considered good learners. But Pahan added that if these results could be replicated in slow learning students, cinnamon could become one of the safest and easiest approaches to convert weaker students to good learners. Cinnamon may halt the progression of Parkinson's disease Pahan and his colleagues previously found that cinnamon had a positive effect on the brains of mice with Parkinson's disease. When cinnamon transforms into sodium benzoate, it works to protect the neurons, normalize brain cells, and improve communication within the brain, which slows down the progression of the disease.Given their promising results, Pahan and his team - supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health ‚Äì plan on moving forward with testing in human patients with Parkinson's disease.""This could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in Parkinson's patients,"" Pahan said. ""It would be a remarkable advance in the treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disease,"" he added.Before starting to add cinnamon to all your dishes, know that not all cinnamon is created equal. Pahan explained that there are two major types of cinnamon available in the United States - Chinese or cassia cinnamon and Ceylon cinnamon. While both metabolize into sodium benzoate, Ceylon cinnamon is much better than Chinese cinnamon. Chinese cinnamon contains coumarin, a molecule that can damage the liver .

  Monsanto , Hillary Clinton fundraiser , Charles Burson (NaturalNews) Wikileaks email 28657, part of the John Podesta email leaks, reveals that the Hillary Clinton campaign sought money from a top Monsanto executive to put her into the White House. See the email here .Hillary Clinton, known as the Bride of Frankenfood , is a longtime supporter of Monsanto, a corporation whose deceptive tactics of collusion, intimidation and bullying are a perfect fit for the Clinton regime, which even a former FBI official now describes as a criminal operation .The Monsanto operative invited to the fundraiser was none other than Charles W. Burson, Monsanto's former Executive V.P., Secretary and General Counsel. Burson, who retired from Monsanto in 2006 but still maintained an active Monsanto.com email address all the way through 2015, was praised by Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant for pushing the corporation's international imperialism agenda to force patented seeds down the throats of poor farmers in developing nations. It's sickening. Via PR Newswire : ""On behalf of the Monsanto Board of Directors and the employees of Monsanto, I thank Charles for his service to our company,"" said Hugh Grant, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Monsanto. ""During his tenure, Monsanto successfully transitioned from an agricultural company fueled by its chemistry business to one led by its seeds and traits businesses. Charles has played an important role in building the company's legal organization to better serve our growing business, not only in the United States but also in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, where farmers are increasingly choosing to plant Monsanto seeds and technologies. Clinton fundraiser sought money from one of the most evil corporations in the history of humankind In other words, Charles Burson was instrumental in Monsanto suing farmers whose fields were contaminated by genetically modified Monsanto seeds . This legal action by Monsanto is globally considered to be one of the most evil, anti-human rights abuses of legal power ever witnessed in the modern world, yet the Hillary Clinton campaign saw this man as an opportunity to raise more money to put Hillary Clinton into the White House (where, no doubt, she would return the favor to Monsanto through government policy decisions at the USDA and FDA).Fully consistent with the criminal conduct of the Clinton crime mafia, Charles Burson also took part in excusing Monsanto's illegal bribery of over 140 Indonesian officials as part of its international agricultural imperialism march against subsistence farmers.After caught committing massive bribery and collusion in Indonesia, Monsanto's then general counsel Charles Burson explained that no, Monsanto isn't a bad company. They're super honest, and transparent and ethical, too!""The company has taken remedial actions to address the activities in Indonesia. At every stage of this process -- beginning with our voluntary disclosure and throughout the governmental investigations and settlement process -- Monsanto has been fully cooperative, and has made clear that improper activities will not be tolerated by the company. We are pleased today to begin the process of putting these matters to rest,"" wrote Burson. Surprise! The Justice Department then ""defers prosecution"" of Monsanto and forgets these crimes ever happened... Whaddaya know! With the corrupt, lawless Justice Department calling the shots, Monsanto was then given a get out of jail free card by the political elite in Washington.From the same link above: The Justice Department said it had agreed to defer prosecution on the criminal information for three years, saying it would dismiss it after the period if Monsanto fully complied with the terms of the agreement. So, wait. You mean to tell me that a corporation which got caught bribing 140 foreign officials in Indonesia -- a felony crime under U.S. law -- was able to get away with it by claiming they will be honest from now on? And the Justice Department says oh yes, you're fine now, there will be no prosecution for your serious crimes? And then the Clinton fundraiser people specifically reach out to the Monsanto attorney who orchestrated all this and said, ""Hey, this guy would be awesome to help support a Clinton presidency?""Yep.That's Hillary Clinton in a nutshell: Hopelessly corrupt... criminally involved... collusion at every level and the total abandonment of human rights and human dignity.

  Clinton corruption , John Podesta , crime family (NaturalNews) It's not just that the corruption and criminality of the Clintons knows no bounds; it's also that the democrat political machine trying to thrust her into power also has total disregard for democracy, truth and ethics. Their mission? Put our nation's worst political criminal into the White House by any means necessary, including systematic lying, fraud, money laundering, intimidation of opponents and even murder of those who might testify against her. The Clinton machine is a mafia operation , and every person involved in it must go to jail.That includes not just the deep operatives like Podesta, Lynch and Abedin, but also all the deep cover Clinton operatives pretending to be journalists , including Stephanopoulos, Maddow, Hayes, Milbank and all the rest ( see the list here ). Every one of these people has committed crimes of sedition against the United States of America and is guilty of attempting to defraud democracy, steal the election, and place a mafia criminal into power at the highest level of government through the deliberate pursuit of journalistic malpractice . Seditious Clinton operatives must be arrested and put behind bars to protect America We the People are beyond the stage of merely wanting to vote you out of power and turn off your broadcast networks. It's now time to seek your indictment and imprisonment so that you cannot be allowed to harm this society ever again.Every operative, journalist and co-conspirator with the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton corruption and the Clinton murders must be arrested, indicted and, if found guilty by a fair trial, sent to prison. This nation needs to heal itself from the Clinton nightmare , and the only way that's going to happen is if the criminal traitors, sellouts and corrupt backstabbers are marched away in handcuffs and put behind bars.""A former FBI official said Sunday that Bill and Hillary Clinton are part of a ¬ìcrime family¬î and argued top officials hindered the investigation into Hillary Clinton¬ís private email server while she was secretary of State,"" reports TheHill.com : Kallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late '90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a ¬ìpathological liar.¬îHe also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clinton¬ís private server.¬ìThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,¬î he said. ¬ìThat¬ís the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I¬ím sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.¬î ¬ìGod forbid we put someone like that in the White House,¬î he added of Clinton.Kallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBI¬ís leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau.¬ìThe agents are furious with what¬ís going on, I know that for a fact,¬î he said. Corrupt, pro-Clinton ""journalists"" should not be given any quarter in all this. Much like the propagandists of the Third Reich, they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the American people. Did you know that Hillary Clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the Russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her Clinton Foundation? If you aren't aware of this, you need to watch Clinton Cash immediately . The simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel What America has now come to realize via the Wikileaks email dumps , the Project Veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former FBI agents who know what's really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel .From the DNC (which actively conspired to sideline Bernie Sanders during the nomination process) to the left-wing media (which coordinates false smear attacks against Donald Trump), every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt. Democrat political operatives abide by no laws, no ethics and no boundaries. They lie, cheat and steal their way into power at every election... and they're desperately trying to steal this election, too.It's not just that the Clinton crime family must be taken down, you see: It's that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned . There isn't a high-level operative inside the DNC who isn't committing election fraud on a daily basis. The coordination and collusion, money laundering and pay-to-play ""influence for sale"" schemes are all illegal, yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists today.Every one of these people needs to be arrested, indicted and imprisoned. This is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across America. Aside from their criminality, democrats' policy ideas just don't work Even on policy alone, democrats are total failures . None of their ideas or policies actually work. Look at Obamacare, with its insurance costs now doubling every 2-3 years , with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding. This was hailed as an historic solution by Obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through Congress and the Supreme Court. In reality, Obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis, and I called it that from its inception.Democrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail. They confiscate money from taxpayers, waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up, while siphoning off billions for their own salaries, bonuses and luxurious lifestyles. Then, if you oppose their complete idiocy, they invoke the IRS to have you audited or arrested. This is Amerika today under Obama and the Clintons.This racket must end. The Clintons and all their co-conspirators must be sent to prison. Donald Trump is right when he says this is ""Bigger than Watergate."" There's no comparison. The crimes of the Clintons are a thousand times larger and more damning to democracy than anything Richard Nixon ever attempted. Corrupt leftist media still lying every hour in a desperate attempt to defeat Trump While all this is happening, the corrupt leftist media -- Washington Post, New York Times, MSNBC, CNN, Google News, Yahoo News, etc. -- has long since abandoned any pretense of engaging in journalism and is now all-in for the Clinton criminal mafia.They have thrown their reputations to the wind, betting everything on the most corrupt criminal to ever seek the office of the presidency. They're bleeding readers and viewers by the millions as fed-up Americans change the channels or turn off their cable TV altogether (who needs politicized ESPN, anyway?) to seek out more accurate news online from sites like Natural News and Breitbart.com .Even the mass censorship of political trends by Facebook and Twitter can't stop the avalanche of awakening now sweeping across America. Across every sector of society, the American people are saying ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! We will not allow the criminal democrats to steal this election and install a totalitarian dictator into the White House.We will vote against the establishment in record numbers. We will overwhelm the fraud, out-vote the brain-dead leftists and achieve a landslide victory for Donald Trump.And if the corrupt, criminal democrats still fake the numbers, bribe the electoral voters or commit massive fraud to steal the election, We the People will take to the streets and take our democracy back . We the People will NOT accept a Clinton presidency under these conditions of massive fraud, collusion and extreme media bias Based on everything we are seeing right now, there is no scenario under which Hillary Clinton will be accepted as the legitimate victor of this election. In no way has this been an open, fair and free election. It has been a warped, one-sided exercise in media collusion that isn't fooling anyone.In the minds of the real American people, Hillary Clinton is done for . The People will not stand for more corruption, collusion and criminals running our system. The revolt has begun , and it will sweep through the voting booths, the electorate and if necessary, the very streets of America to demand an end to the failed, corrupt political establishment run by sinister criminals who belong behind bars.Get ready, my friends, to take this country back. First, vote for Donald Trump as a vote against corruption and collusion of the leftist establishment.Secondly, demand the arrest of all Clinton-linked operatives , including those in the leftist lying media.Thirdly, do not tolerate the theft of your democracy by corrupt Clinton operatives who are trying to steal this election. If they steal the votes or steal the Electoral College outcome, prepare to march in the streets to take your country back .Yes, I'm calling for peaceful mass protests, everywhere across America, if the criminal democrats and corrupt leftist media steal this election through fraud. Bring plenty of rope because you may have to swing across moats and scale the walls of the castle to finally reach the inner layers of corruption and criminality in Washington D.C. (That's a metaphor, for the dumb-as-dirt left-wing media journalists who are too stupid to parse a sentence.) DEFEAT Clinton now or lose America to a totalitarian regime that will never let go of absolute power This is your LAST CHANCE to take America back. If you allow the Clintons and the corrupt democrats to seize power through widespread fraud and theft, there will never be an open, fair and free election in America ever again . All opponents of Clinton will be imprisoned or executed. All conservative media outlets will be taken offline or silenced. The borders will be opened to a massive wave of illegal aliens from all across the world, and they will overrun and occupy America, destroying it from within while the bigoted, intolerant democrats turn the entire nation into a ""sanctuary nation"" where illegals have absolute immunity while patriots are executed or imprisoned by the millions.That's the ""American Holocaust"" you're going to be witnessing if you allow these criminals -- Clinton, Abedin, Podesta, Stephanopoulos and all the rest -- to remain in power. Throw them behind bars if you want to see your country survive the next four years .";english;2016-10-30T23:01:00.763+02:00;naturalnews.com;US;6416.0;Clinton crime family must be taken down...

Monday, October 31, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: Flint , water crisis , EPA cover-up (NaturalNews) The federal bureaucracy and corresponding state agencies have never been much good at responding to crises in a timely fashion, and that tradition was alive and well during the recent toxic water crisis in Flint, Michigan.In fact, according to a newly released watchdog report, Americans now know that the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could have intervened in the crisis a full seven months before it finally did, meaning thousands of residents in Flint would have had to drink far less water tainted with lead.As reported by The Associated Press , the EPA's inspector general said that the agency had the authority and enough information to issue emergency orders to protect Flint residents from the lead-contaminated water they were drinking as early as June 2015, seven months before officials finally declared an emergency.Inspector General Arthur Elkins said in an interim report that the water crisis should have created ""a greater sense of urgency"" for the EPA to ""intervene when the safety of drinking water is compromised."" Everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else The drinking water in Flint became tainted with unsafe levels of lead after city officials decided to begin drawing from the Flint River in April 2014, in a bid to save money. The broke city of about 100,000 residents north of Detroit was under state control at the time.Regulators did not make sure that the water was properly treated, so lead from aging pipes leached into the supply, the AP reported.Since the discovery of high levels of lead, federal, state and local officials have traded accusations about who is most to blame for the crisis , even as residents are still forced to drink bottled or filtered water.Doctors have detected higher than normal levels of lead in hundreds of children around the city. And many taps remain off-limits.Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, appointed a panel to look into the matter. It concluded that the state is ""fundamentally accountable"" for the lead crisis due to decisions made by state environmental regulators as well as state-appointed emergency managers who were in charge of running the city.But that said, once the EPA discovered that water being consumed by city residents was tainted with unsafe levels of lead, Snyder believes the agency should have acted ‚Äì and he is right.""As Gov. Snyder has stated all along, what happened in Flint was the result of failure of government at all levels,"" his spokeswoman, Anna Heaton, said recently.Since the crisis began, officials have tried to reshuffle the deck, so to speak, and call it ""reform."" They say some state agencies have undergone ""culture changes"" that will supposedly prevent future recurrences of epic failure, according to Heaton, who called such changes ""encouraging."" People should be held accountable ‚Äì but won't be It's unclear how many people actually believe that, considering that state agencies had mandates already to protect the public from polluted and contaminated water (as did the EPA). By ""culture changes,"" does Heaton mean that people were fired and actually replaced by others who will do what taxpayers are paying them to do?Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, a Democrat who took office after the crisis emerged, said agencies like the EPA and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality are there ""to help ensure the well-being and safety of men, women and children,"" yet they failed in their core mission to do so. She also called for those who are responsible for the crisis to be held accountable, though we advise her not to hold her breath.As for the EPA's inspector general report, it said that the agency's Midwest region did not issue an emergency order because officials concluded actions taken by the state prevented the EPA from doing so. The report says that their interpretation was not correct, and that according to federal law, when state actions are deemed to be unacceptable, ""the EPA can and should proceed with an (emergency) order"" designed to protect ""the public in a timely manner.""Without EPA intervention, ""the conditions in Flint persisted, and the state continued to delay taking action to require corrosion control or provide alternative drinking water supplies,"" the report said.

Monday, October 31, 2016 by: Natural News Editors (NaturalNews) I've been trying to figure out what common trait binds Clinton supporters together. As far as I can tell, the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its forms.If you have a Trump sign in your lawn, they will steal it.If you have a Trump bumper sticker, they will deface your car.if you speak of Trump at work you could get fired.(Article republished from Dilbert.com )On social media, almost every message I get from a Clinton supporter is a bullying type of message. They insult. They try to shame. They label. And obviously they threaten my livelihood.We know from Project Veritas that Clinton supporters tried to incite violence at Trump rallies. The media downplays it.We also know Clinton's side hired paid trolls to bully online. You don't hear much about that.Yesterday, by no coincidence, Huffington Post, Salon, and Daily Kos all published similar-sounding hit pieces on me, presumably to lower my influence. (That reason, plus jealousy, are the only reasons writers write about other writers.)Joe Biden said he wanted to take Trump behind the bleachers and beat him up. No one on Clinton's side disavowed that call to violence because, I assume, they consider it justified hyperbole.Team Clinton has succeeded in perpetuating one of the greatest evils I have seen in my lifetime. Her side has branded Trump supporters (40%+ of voters) as Nazis, sexists, homophobes, racists, and a few other fighting words. Their argument is built on confirmation bias and persuasion. But facts don't matter because facts never matter in politics. What matters is that Clinton's framing of Trump provides moral cover for any bullying behavior online or in person. No one can be a bad person for opposing Hitler, right?Some Trump supporters online have suggested that people who intend to vote for Trump should wear their Trump hats on election day. That is a dangerous idea, and I strongly discourage it. There would be riots in the streets because we already know the bullies would attack. But on election day, inviting those attacks is an extra-dangerous idea. Violence is bad on any day, but on election day, Republicans are far more likely to unholster in an effort to protect their voting rights. Things will get wet fast.Yes, yes, I realize Trump supporters say bad things about Clinton supporters too. I don't defend the bad apples on either side. I'll just point out that Trump's message is about uniting all Americans under one flag. The Clinton message is that some Americans are good people and the other 40% are some form of deplorables, deserving of shame, vandalism, punishing taxation, and violence. She has literally turned Americans on each other. It is hard for me to imagine a worse thing for a presidential candidate to do.I'll say that again.As far as I can tell, the worst thing a presidential candidate can do is turn Americans against each other. Clinton is doing that, intentionally. Intentionally. As I often say, I don't know who has the best policies. I don't know the best way to fight ISIS and I don't know how to fix healthcare or trade deals. I don't know which tax policies are best to lift the economy. I don't know the best way to handle any of that stuff. (And neither do you.) But I do have a bad reaction to bullies. And I've reached my limit.I hope you have too. Therefore... I endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States because I oppose bullying in all its forms. I don't defend Trump's personal life. Neither Trump nor Clinton are role models for our children. Let's call that a tie, at worst.The bullies are welcome to drown in their own bile while those of us who want a better world do what we've been doing for hundreds of years: Work to make it better while others complain about how we're doing it.Today I put Trump's odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%. Remember, I told you a few weeks ago that Trump couldn't win unless ""something changed.""Something just changed.";english;2016-10-31T08:22:49.479+02:00;naturalnews.com;US;6416.0;Dilbert creator Scott Adams endorses Trump, says Hillary is a bully;0.0;http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/640/EditorialUse/Editorial-Use-Donald-Trump-Hat.jpg;0;1;941;0;941;junksci

We all know about the popular and ancient practice of oil pulling, but many of us don‚Äôt understand how this practice works or how exactly it benefits our teeth! Oil pulling began in Ayurvedic medicine thousands of years ago and has achieved widespread popularity in modern society today. 
But the question remains‚Äîdoes it help your smile? And how? 
The Claims of Oil Pulling 
Let‚Äôs take a look at each of these popular claims of oil pulling! 
It makes your mouth healthier. By pulling out bad bacteria that can cause cavities and gum disease, oil pulling can actually make your mouth healthier and even stop chronic bad breath. 
It whitens teeth. Research has not proved this, but some people claim they get whiter teeth with oil pulling. This should be considered a side effect of oil pulling (albeit a great one) rather than its main purpose. 
It heals cavities. Oil pulling can remove the bacteria and plaque that cause tooth decay, but typically oil pulling alone is not enough to heal cavities. You need to stop eating so much sugar, get more vitamins and minerals (such as K, D, and calcium), and switch your toothpaste to help heal cavities with oil pulling! 
It cures disease. Ancient cultures used oil pulling as a way to draw out toxins from the mouth to prevent them from affecting the body. Research doesn‚Äôt show whether or not oil pulling can help any type of disease, but research does link oral health to body health‚Äîso a healthy mouth could help you prevent heart disease , respiratory illnesses, and even cognitive decline! 
What the Research Says 
Now that we‚Äôve seen the popular claims of oil pulling, let‚Äôs find out what modern research actually says about this age-old practice. 
Research shows that oil pulling can actually the stop inflammation, bacteria, plaque, and bad breath associated with gum disease, therefore it may be an effective treatment for gum disease combined with a healthy diet and great oral health practices! 
It can decrease the likelihood of tooth decay and reduce overall plaque content in the mouth. Oil pulling can also help prevent tooth loss and oral diseases such as oral cancer, periodontal disease, and oral thrush. Oil pulling may be able to reverse tooth decay, but only when combined with other healthy practices. 
Although research hasn‚Äôt proved that oil pulling helps decrease your chances for developing chronic disease, keeping your mouth healthy and free of toxins can benefit your whole body! 
The Verdict 
If you want to give oil pulling a try, do this practice every day: put a tablespoon of oil in your mouth (preferably sesame or coconut) and swish it around for up to twenty minutes as soon as you wake up. Spit out in the trash, then brush and floss your teeth as normal. Easy! 
The verdict is in: oil pulling can help you get a beautiful and healthy smile, but it should not replace regular brushing and flossing as your oral care routine. Practice oil pulling first thing in the morning before you eat or brush, then enjoy the benefits of a healthy smile without giving up your brushing and flossing habits!

My husband and I have made many mistakes along the way, but we have never been afraid to put in the hard work to get any job done. For all our hard work, we have become one of the rare profitable homesteads that are more than just surviving. 
We all have our own reasons that we want to try homesteading, so don‚Äôt base yours off of mine. I am just hoping to spark some interest to get you off your feet so you can make your dream become a reality. I Provide Healthy Food For My Family 
We are not vegan, vegetarian, of allergic to gluten, but we are completely aware of what we are putting into our bodies. I just don‚Äôt like to buy vegetables from the grocery store that have been produced chemically. I also don‚Äôt like to buy meat that was fed all sorts of things that I don‚Äôt know about. 
Everything that I put on my kitchen table, to feed my family, has been grown or produced by me or someone I know. I know that the corn we ate last night was grown using some organic soil, water, and a little alpaca poop for good measure. The pork also came from our farm, and I know about everything that pig ate in his very happy two years of life. 
I‚Äôm not saying that we are the healthiest family in the world, but I know we aren‚Äôt eating chemicals . That is what matters to me and my husband! The Food Tastes So Much Better 
The food that we produce on our homestead is so much better that the food you are purchasing at the grocery store. The truth is that they are looking to produce as much perfect looking food as they can, as fast as they can. They don‚Äôt want to grow the strands of produce that take a little longer but taste exponentially better. 
The meat also takes better because you aren‚Äôt rushing that either. Not to mention the fact that you are feeding the animals with healthier and better tasting food. When you slaughter the food yourself, it will taste better as well. Animals that are stressed when they get slaughtered produce meat that is much tougher that meat that we produce here on the homestead. Freedom 
Not many people can say that they have complete freedom to do what they please during the day. Now, that doesn‚Äôt mean that we don‚Äôt have responsibilities, but we can take an hour off in the middle of the day to attend the elementary school winter concert. We can also take those doctor appointments in the middle of the day when the office isn‚Äôt insane. 
If you want to get freedom over your own life, start homesteading today ! We Have Economic Security 
If the economy crashes, we are not in risk of going without anything that we really need. We don‚Äôt rely on anyone for any of the basic necessities, including a source of income. We have everything that we need in order to survive right here on the homestead. There isn‚Äôt much that can go wrong with the government that could put us at risk. 
I am not an apocalypse prepper, but I will say that homesteaders are more prepared should a disaster occur. We have more knowledge and experience in all of the tasks needed in an extreme survival situation than most people I know. Our Kids Understand The Meaning of Hard Work 
I‚Äôm not saying that your kids don‚Äôt understand the meaning of hard work, but my kids have been there and done that. My nine year old wakes up two hours before school and takes care of the chickens every day. Those chickens are completely her responsibility and she know that. 
I do allow my kids to use electronics during down time, they just know the difference between down time and chore time. They feel like they are part of the team, so it doesn‚Äôt feel like we are making them do chores every day.

There was a time when my son‚Äôs eczema became so severe I was willing to try any natural healing method. My baby was 5 months old when he developed eczema. We tried the usual dose of steroids and over-the-counter creams from our family doctor. It got so bad that his scars were not healing. He wasn‚Äôt sleeping. And I wasn‚Äôt sleeping. As a child, my mother took me to an Acupuncturist for migraines. And the migraines stopped after a handful of visits. I remember it being a pretty relaxing experience with the smell of incense and herbs and the quietness of the room. So, I took a leap of faith and booked us for an appointment with a Traditional Chinese Doctor who specialized in skin disorders, allergies, and asthma. Why Try Acupuncture & Traditional Chinese Medicine? Reason 1: Acupuncture has been practiced for almost 4000 years in China. 
With that much history, it‚Äôs worth a try. It is a method of relieving pain or curing an illness by placing needles in the patient‚Äôs body at precise points along the 12 meridians in the body. Meridians are energy pathways that are associated with different organs within the body. The World Health Organization lists 300 ailments that are treatable by Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture. Reason 2: Acupuncture has helped children with eczema 
In a study of 37 children who were treated with Chinese Medicinal herbs, the treatment reduced eczema symptoms by 90% in 18 of the children (see Sources). Although it was a small study size, the benefits seem to far outweigh the risks. When my son was a baby, even a 10% improvement in his symptoms would have been amazing for us. Reason 3: Acupuncture does not hurt babies 
Many people worry about the needles hurting. But the needles that Acupuncturists use are about 1/100 th of a syringe needle. My son was a baby when we started the treatments, and he never cried out when getting the needles in him. Reason 4: Acupuncture relieved my baby‚Äôs eczema by 80% 
Acupuncture healed the eczema to the point where we could figure out his triggers. Our doctor stabilized the eczema. Best of all, flare-ups only occurred when my baby was teething. His skin was softer than it had been in months. Acupuncture needs to be done on babies for a minimum of 3 months in order to see an improvement. This is because the treatment is trying to alter the immune response, which is a long process. But sometimes babies will respond quicker than that. We used a topical herb powder given to us by the doctor, and applied it to his skin. This topical mix had a similar effect as hydro-cortisone cream if I applied it 3-5 times per day with a cotton ball. Reason 5: Acupuncture is affordable 
This is true especially if you go to a student clinic. You can pay the affordable price and yet the students are supervised by very experienced doctors. For child and baby treatments, it is even more affordable. It cost us about $15-$30 per visit on average (we tried a few different clinics). Some health plans will cover Acupuncture, so check with your health plan to see if yours covers it. To keep it affordable, I suggest trying to find a specialist in Acupuncture & TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), not a practitioner who does many different types of treatments. Tips for Helping Your Child While Getting Acupuncture 
Bring a favorite stuffed animal, a book, or some toys. Try nursing your baby while they are receiving acupuncture. A baby only needs the needle in the acupressure point for a second and then they are pulled out. Adults typically have needles in for 45+ minutes for each treatment, because our bodies do not respond as quickly as babies‚Äô bodies do. Check out my YouTube video for more tips! Find an Experienced & Accredited Acupuncturist 
Make sure to look for an Accredited Acupuncturist or TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) Doctor. Be sure the Acupuncturist has some experience in your condition. Chat with the people in the waiting room. And see if they‚Äôve had success with your doctor. I met a few moms in the waiting room that swore by the Chinese Doctor we were going to see. That made me feel more comfortable. 
Find a TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) Doctor who offers Certified Organic Chinese herbs. ‚ÄúCertified Organic‚Äù means the herbs were never sprayed with toxic pesticides and herbicides. As well, there have been some reports of heavy metals residue in Chinese herbs. Herbs are just as powerful as prescription medications and can have adverse effects if used improperly. Make sure to ask about the testing done on the herbs that you or your baby are prescribed. Every Condition Has Different Treatment Needs 
Check with your family doctor to be sure you don‚Äôt have any conditions that would prevent you from using Acupuncture or Chinese Medicine. All the information in this article is provided for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for medical counseling.

This is just a straight up fact, especially since many of our voting machines are so antiquated. As you vote this year you should watch out for these glitches. Sometimes the votes appear to be ‚Äúflipped‚Äù as in a voter intends to vote for Candidate A, but Candidate B‚Äôs name is selected on the screen. 
When this happens it is known as ‚Äúvote flipping,‚Äù and is supposed to only happen rarely. With millions of votes cast, there have supposedly only been a few hundred reports of vote flipping every year for the past decade. These are the ones reported so you do wonder whether this happens unnoticed much more often. I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôm seeing reports of this specifically happening all around the country so cast your vote and double check. Check your ballot after you cast your vote and if it happens to you call on a poll worker to help get it fixed. Remember Voting Machine malfunctions do happen. 
There are reports of this happening already in North Carolina, Texas and Nevada with machines vote flipping in the last couple weeks. 
‚ÄúYou have to remember that the majority of the machines in use today predate the iPhone or the iPad, and most of them use technology from the late ‚Äô90s,‚Äù Lawrence Norden, a voting technology expert at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, told TIME. ‚ÄúAs these machines age, you start to have hardware issues.‚Äù 
One problem that also occurs on older machines is the glue that attaches the screen to the machine breaks down and you can get alignment issues as well. Poll workers and technicians need to reset the machines regularly to ensure the buttons are lined up right. In other cases, it can just be a user error because no one uses the type of equipment used at the voting centers on a regular basis. 
In Texas voters reported attempting to vote a straight Republican ticket, but found the Clinton/Kaine ticket selected instead. This can be found specifically in voting districts where they use the old, rotary-style voting machine. 
If you select one candidate and the other appears on the screen or if you‚Äôre looking at the summary screen and it just isn‚Äôt right voters should notify the poll workers. They can cancel out your session so you can do it over.

You are not alone. There are more than 3 million reported cases per year in the USA alone! Hemorrhoids are often caused from straining during bowel movements, obesity and are especially prevalent in pregnancy. Mild to excruciating discomfort is the number one symptom, especially during bowel movements or when sitting. Other very unpleasant symptoms include itching and bleeding. The older you get the more likely you are to experience them. They are very rare in the under 13 year age bracket, common between 14-18 and become very common for the over 18 crowd. Hemorrhoids Related to Digestive Problems 
Hemorrhoids are often a sign of inefficient digestion, decreased liver function and/or not having enough digestive enzymes to properly digest your food. It can also indicate inflammation in the small intestines. Hemorrhoids occur when the bowel and liver are stagnate. Symptoms become apparent due to swollen and inflamed veins around the anus and rectum (sorry!). This can be caused by chronic constipation, straining and putting pressure on the lower bowel 
During digestion we produce enzymes in our mouth and stomach which break down the foods and help to absorb nutrients. When enzymes are not sufficient to break foods down, it sits in the stomach and ferments. This leads to gas, bloating and fermentation. Liver Health is Crucial to Prevention 
The liver is most active between 1-3 am when it is processing wastes, cleansing, eliminating lymphatic drainage and regenerating. If the liver is not working optimally due to health issues, allergies, drug side effects or poor eating habits then it may be overtaxed. 
Often people will wake up during the time the liver is most active (1-3am) and feel thirsty and hot because the liver is working over time. So this can be why you get up nightly to get a drink of water. How to Heal Hemorrhoids Fast 
Step 1: Optimize liver and kidney function Consider taking an all natural electrolyte powder supplement which can be added to water. These powders are available in health food stores and contain the basic electrolytes Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium and Calcium. Make sure they don‚Äôt contain artificial colors or other unhealthy additives. 
Increase your fluid intake throughout the day especially if you exercise and lose hydration through sweat. Eating Right for Prevention Eat 5 smaller meals a day rather than 3 large ones. Limit sugar, salt, tea, coffee, alcohol and soda In the morning drink a 60z glass of warm water with 1 teaspoon Apple Cider Vinegar, 1/2 tsp honey and either fresh lemon juice or 2 drops of high quality lemon essential oil. (Lemon increases digestive juices, cleanses the bowels and helps the liver to detoxify. Lemon also has the ability to clean out the diverticuli pockets in the bowels and reduce stagnation.) Hydrate well to preventing drying out the bowels which can cause constipation. Eat greens such as radicchio and endive to promote digestion. Drink Peppermint, Dandelion, Burdock or Chamomile herbal teas. Add healthy oils into your diet including avocados, fish oil , virgin olive oil, flaxseed oil, nuts and seeds. These are all good lubricants allowing stools to pass more easily. Add vegetables, fruits and other healthy fibrous foods. Avoid drinking liquids 20 minutes before or after eating to avoid diluting digestive enzymes. Cut down on wheat, dairy, processed and refined foods as well as excessively spicy foods. Additional Preventative Measures 
Consider doing a gentle liver detoxification and overall cleanse every 6 months to promote better digestion and keep your bowels moving properly. Probiotics can help the digestive tract balance of good flora as bloating is often contributed to fermentation, constipation and inflammation which lead to hemorrhoids and bowel issues. Taking Slippery elm supplements before meals can be helpful. As well as taking Vitamin C, bioflavinoids (Rutin) and Magnesium supplements may reduce hemorrhoids and cleanse the bowel. Heal Hemorrhoids Fast Recipe Add 5 drops each of Lavender and Tea Tree (Melaleuca) Essential oil 3 Tbs of fractionated (or melted) virgin coconut oil Place these in a small glass container like a 4 oz mason jar. 
For each application to the affected area take a cotton makeup remover pad and dampen with water before use. Squeeze excess water and then dip into your remedy jar. Wipe with this soothing mixture after each time you use the restroom and you will get instant relief and often clear up the issue in less than 24 hours. You can heal hemorrhoids fast!

When most people think about their eye health , the first thing that comes to mind is whether or not they need to wear glasses. Although your vision is a major part of your overall eye health, there are actually many more things that you need to be concerned about. For example, there are a staggering 56 common disorders that can plague your eyes. These issues range from cataracts to ocular migraines. Fortunately, there are many natural methods you can utilize to help keep your eyes healthy. 
Nutrients Your Eyes Need 
There are three nutrients that are known to be critical for maintaining healthy eyes: Lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin. Each of these nutrients serves as an antioxidant that helps protect your eyes from the damaging effects of free radicals. As Natural News has pointed out before, free radicals are the main basis of all injuries, illnesses and deaths. 
Antioxidants are the only way to fight free radicals, so it‚Äôs a good thing that these three nutrients are found naturally in the human eye. But what happens when something interrupts this process? Sadly, you can end up with a long list of eye health problems that may even lead to blindness. 
Instead of merely sitting back and allowing this to happen, you can be proactive and start taking supplements. The good news is that lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are easy to find. Research has discovered that most of these supplements also contain meso-zeaxanthin, although this isn‚Äôt usually disclosed on the label. In fact, it sounds likely that this recently discovered eye nutrient is a natural byproduct of lutein and zeaxanthin. 
Of course, this doesn‚Äôt absolve the supplement companies of their duty to report whether or not meso-zeaxanthin is present in their products. However, their negligence also doesn‚Äôt reduce the natural reliance that your eyes have on all three of these nutrients. In addition to stocking up on these supplements, it is also wise to increase your intake of other naturally occurring antioxidants, including Vitamin E, Vitamin C and beta carotene. 
Food Sources 
There are many foods that contain antioxidants . Carrots are perhaps the most well-known resource for eye health because they are so rich in beta carotene. It would be a mistake to think of carrots as the prime resource, though. You can also turn to oranges, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and dark berries for a mixture of necessary vitamins. These are some of the best foods for eye health. Even better, you can derive lutein and zeaxanthin directly from food sources such as eggs, pistachios, corn, peppers and kale. With enough of these food items in your diet, you can avoid the cost of supplements while still keeping your eyes extremely healthy. 
Additional Eye Health Tips 
If you are a smoker who is also concerned about eye health, now is a good time to carefully consider quitting. Unfortunately, people who smoke have an increased risk of developing macular degeneration, optic nerve damage and cataracts. If you begin abstaining from tobacco products now, though, your odds of ending up with one of these eye health complications will begin to decline. 
Other easy steps you can take to protect your eyes include always wearing sunglasses during sunny days and steering clear of computer screens as much as possible. If you use a computer for work, take a 20 second vision break every 20 minutes. 
Ultimately, combining the proper nutrients with easy tips such as wearing sunglasses will help keep your eyes healthy throughout your life. If you‚Äôre currently dealing with issues such as light sensitivity and vision loss, you may also be able to naturally regain control of your eye health by using natural vision training and other eye exercises. This is definitely a better option than undergoing a surgery that has an extensive list of serious risks and usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses. As usual, the natural way is better!

Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: China , organ harvesting , political prisoners (NaturalNews) In the U.S. these days, supporting GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump will earn you an assault from Left-wing cowards and bullies who support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . But in China, being a political dissident and opposing the ruling Communist government could earn you a trip to a hospital operating room.Where you'll have your organs removed for waiting ""transplant tourists.""As reported by the Epoch Times , Chinese officials began persecuting the 100 million practitioners of Falun Gong in July 1999, and have continued to do so ever since. To the Chinese communists, there is no such thing as a religious deity or belief, because communists insist that their form of government should be the only thing requiring loyalty and faithfulness.Not long ago this kind of treatment of Chinese ""dissidents"" would draw loud rebukes from the U.S. government, the United Nations and various human rights organizations around the world, as well as major media coverage. But since the Chinese manufacturing economy has become such an integral part of the economies of most of the world's advanced countries, outrage has been muted.The lack of outrage and subsequent media coverage and pressure by governments has essentially given the Chinese communists a green light to treat Falun Gong ‚Äì and anyone else deemed a political dissident ‚Äì in any barbaric way they choose. 'A new form of evil' Hence, the creation of a cottage industry of sorts ‚Äì Transplant Tourism. As the Epoch Times noted, this is essentially "" murder on demand "" for an organ that is purchased ahead of time by someone who then travels to China for a transplant operation. It is a huge source of revenue both for the Chinese military and for private hospitals around the country, according to Nobel Prize nominees and investigators David Matas, an international human rights attorney, and David Kilgour, a former Canadian foreign secretary for Asia-Pacific.Matas and Kilgour published their first investigative report in 2006 , and evidence about forced harvesting of organs in China from prisoners of conscience has only mounted in the years since. The investigators found that the overwhelming majority of the pool of victims did not come from prisoners sentenced to death but rather from prisoners of conscience, primarily followers of Falun Gong ‚Äì the largest group in China's prisons.In their 2006 report, Matas described the systematic harvesting of organs from Falun Gong adherents by the Chinese Communist Party as ""a new form of evil we have yet to see on this planet.""One of the founding board members of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH), Dr. Dana Churchill, spoke at rallies in Los Angeles and Santa Monica Beach earlier this month. She said that to this point the world had never witnessed a ""more horrific and barbaric crime as the Chinese Communist Party has committed against Falun Gong."" 'Crime against humanity' She added that it wasn't just Falun Gong adherents who were being victimized, however. Others include Christians, the Uyghurs and Tibetans, all of whom have also had their organs harvested ""while they are alive, unwilling, and between 20 and 40 years old, the prime of their life,"" Churchill ‚Äì a naturopathic doctor from Pasadena, Calif., said. Epoch Times noted that recently released findings on the number of Chinese prisoners who have been murdered go way beyond original estimates collected from various investigators and organizations.Churchill said: ""With Falun Gong, approximately 65,000 have been murdered, and that is according to DAFOH, our organization.""At a Washington, D.C., rally on July 17, 2015, following nine years of investigation, the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong announced that it had ""concluded that since July 20, 1999, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), lead by its former head Jiang Zemin, has utilized China's entire state apparatus to harvest organs from living Falun Gong practitioners,"" as a way to ""physically destroy"" the group as a whole.""This is genocide and a crime against humanity,"" the organization concluded.

  Amy Goodrich Tags: toxins , childrens health , poisoning (NaturalNews) Toxins are everywhere. They are lurking in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects our modern lifestyle creates. They can suffer profound and permanent adverse health effects which affect their developing brain and nervous system.A leading group of U.S. scientists, medical experts, and health organizations said that they are witnessing a dramatic increase in learning and behavioral issues in children. Therefore, they called for chemicals to be banned at the first sign of danger rather than waiting for direct, scientific proof.""Our failures to protect children from harm underscore the urgent need for a better approach to developing and assessing scientific evidence and using it to make decisions,"" the experts said.Here are the top ten toxins that our kids are exposed to on a daily basis. 1.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exposure to high levels of mercury can cause lung damage, while prolonged low exposure may result in memory loss, neurological impairment, kidney abnormalities, and skin rashes. 2. Vaccines As stated by the National Vaccine Information Center , a typical child receives about 49 recommended doses of 14 toxin-laden vaccines before the age of six. Here's a short list of the most common toxic chemicals found in vaccines: formaldehyde (used to preserve dead things), mercury, aluminum (associated with Alzheimer's), GMO yeast, antibiotics, and monosodium glutamate (MSG). 3. Prescription drugs Overprescribing doctors, with close ties to the Big Pharma are a real treat when it comes to your child's safety. Writing for Blogs Natural News , Dr. Brent Hunter explained that some of these drugs are the legal versions of addictive street drugs. Take ADHD medication as an example. These commonly prescribed drugs are quite similar to drugs like meth and speed. 4. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) MSG is a common, artificial food additive with neurotoxic effects. It has been linked to numerous health problems like brain lesions, obesity, malformed organs, abnormal reproductive systems, infertility, aggression, antisocial behavior, and high cholesterol. 5. Processed and fast foods We all know that processed or fast foods are bad news . They are loaded with artificial synthetic chemicals, preservatives, nitrates and artificial colors and flavors which have been linked to a host of adverse health effects. 6. Toxins in personal care products When you read the label of personal care products such as body washes, moisturizers, deodorants, and toothpaste, you might not recognize most of their ingredients. When these chemicals seep into the skin, they can cause devastating, long-term effects. Opt for non-toxic, organic alternatives instead. 7. Toxins in Laundry detergent If your laundry detergent has a strong, nice fragrance, chances are it is packed with cancer-causing toxins. Some of these chemicals can be absorbed through your skin. 8. Toxic cleaning products ""Keep out of reach of children,"" is not an uncommon phrase on the label of cleaning products. While we all know that they can be harmful or fatal when swallowed, Dr. Brent Hunter said that we don't need to drink them to experience the damaging side-effects. These chemicals can also end up in our body through inhalation or contact with the skin. 9. Pesticides Pesticides are everywhere. They are in our home, the environment, and the food we eat. Opting for natural pest control and organic, homegrown foods is your best chance to avoid these toxins from entering your home. 10. Soda Sodas are loaded with phosphoric acid which weakens your child's bones and teeth. Furthermore, they contain high amounts of high fructose corn syrup that causes obesity and diabetes.

  Isabelle Z. Tags: nutrients , food pairings , turmeric (NaturalNews) If you are making a conscious effort to eat nutritious food, you are already stacking the odds in your favor when it comes to your health and well-being. However, eating all the organic fruits and vegetables in the world is not going to do much for you if your body is not prepared to absorb the nutrients they contain.To be clear, eating a diet that is rich in organic produce, whole grains, and a reasonable amount of healthy fats is always preferable to a diet full of fried food, sugar and processed foods. However, if you want to maximize the benefits of your smart eating choices, you should try some of these food pairings to enhance nutrient absorption and give your health a boost. Milk and honey Your grandmother might have offered you a glass of warm milk with honey when you struggled to fall asleep as a child, and this tried-and-true combination has stood the test of time for good reason: it is a very effective pairing for your health. An amino acid found in milk known as tryptophan is used by the brain to make melatonin and serotonin, while the carbohydrates in honey can help with the uptake of tryptophan. Turmeric and black pepper The active ingredient in turmeric, curcumin, has anti-inflammatory properties, but it tends to be poorly absorbed by the body. Interestingly, the piperine found in black pepper can help boost its absorption significantly, which is why many supplements contain both ingredients. Try cooking a dish that contains generous amounts of turmeric , like curry, and add a sprinkling of black pepper. A tiny pinch of pepper can enhance your absorption of curcumin by more than 2,000 percent! Green tea and lemon If you are drinking green tea for its extraordinary antioxidant content, you might want to start adding some organic lemon juice to your cup. That's because Purdue University researchers have discovered that mixing green tea with lemon juice can significantly boost the amount of antioxidants that are available for your body to absorb. The catechins in green tea can help protect your body against cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Olive oil and tomatoes These two Mediterranean diet staples go hand in hand, and it's easy to see why. Tomatoes contain antioxidants that can protect your body from disease, and adding a small amount of healthy fat to carotenoid-rich foods like tomatoes can increase its absorption. Try making a simple salad of chopped tomatoes drizzled in extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar to reap the benefits. The lycopene in tomatoes is also better absorbed when they are heated first, so take this one step further and make a tomato sauce or pizza sauce by cooking tomatoes and adding olive oil and www.herbs.news ""="""" target=""_blank"">www.herbs.news"">fresh herbs like oregano. Beans and cauliflower People who follow plant-based diets often rely on beans to get iron, but this type of iron is not as easily absorbed by the human body as iron that comes from meat sources. You can increase your body's absorption of the iron from beans by consuming a food that is rich in vitamin C at the same time, and cauliflower fits the bill quite nicely. Pair cauliflower with green beans or garbanzos to give your body an iron boost. You can also try other iron and vitamin C pairings , like strawberries with oatmeal.While all of these foods are quite healthy on their own, if you are looking to increase your intake of certain nutrients, make sure you are opting for food pairings and preparation methods that will boost absorption so you can reap the most benefits.

  S. D. Wells Tags: natural cures , indigenous medicine , healing plants (NaturalNews) Before World War II, very few Americans suffered from cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease, strokes, arthritis, osteoporosis, food allergies, psoriasis, eczema, autism, Asperger's syndrome or even fibromyalgia. There were no processed foods, no genetically modified organisms, no chemical pesticides, no toxic vaccines loaded with mercury and aluminum, no over-the-counter medications loaded with artificial food dyes and heavy metal toxins, no artificial sweeteners, no fluoride in the tap water, no leaking nuclear reactors, and of course, there were no insidious oncologists giving people lethal chemical drugs (chemotherapy) to fight off cell disorder (cancer) that's caused by chemical consumption in the first place.None of that was going on, because the American Medical Association had yet to figure out that if all mainstream medicine was simply made of chemicals, everybody who got sick would stay sick, and the medicine industry would become one of the biggest money makers in the history of the world.Yes, that was the time of amazing indigenous medicine , when natural healers were doing wonders for sick folks using natural remedies . And when people did get sick, they took medicine that had worked for millennia, not some lab-concocted chemicals that crooked science journals swore would work. The Chinese and the American Indians didn't get lucky; they used food as medicine , and it worked.Have you had enough of medicine that's so poisonous that they have to inform you about side effects more dangerous than the condition being ""treated?"" Are you sick of paying an arm and a leg for symptom-cover-up chemicals that make you fat, dumb, sicker and closer to death? So is everybody else. Join the club. End the insanity.

Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: Dakota Access Pipeline , protestors , police violence (NaturalNews) Tensions are ratcheting up in a region of North Dakota where construction of a pipeline that will take oil to a refinery facility in Illinois is being built, as protestors objecting to the project are clashing with increasingly militarized police . The Bismark Tribune reported that police and protestors clashed as authorities moved in to break up a camp on private property belonging to the pipeline developers.Protestors had initially formed a line of no surrender, the paper said, but it became a line of retreat in the face of a militarized police presence that overwhelmed hundreds of Dakota Access Pipeline protestors, pushing them back from the front line of resistance to their main camp.For about five hours on Thursday, beginning around noon, police officers pressed the protesters back about a half-mile on N.D. Highway 1806, which was away from a new camp they had built earlier in the week that sat directly atop the pipeline easement. Rubber bullets, bean bags, smoke grenades and tasers Unrest continued into the evening hours, however, as police said that two fires were started on a nearby bridge, and protestors began lobbing Molotov cocktails at officers. In addition, police reported two incidents where shots were fired.The Tribune reported that one woman allegedly fired a handgun in the direction of police as she was being arrested, while an armed man who was reportedly run off the road by protesters, and was perhaps not connected to the protest, had to be treated for a gunshot wound to the hand.As police moved in, some protestors were urging calm and prayer, but others threw rocks and water bottles at approaching officers. Eventually the crowd retreated under a barrage of pepper spray, rubber and bean bag bullets, smoke grenades and tasers.By late afternoon, flames and thick plumes of smoke belched out of the cab of one of three Dakota Access Pipeline earth movers, while protestors walked back to their main camp on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' land.In all, police arrested 141 people, the local sheriffs' department said, charging suspects with engaging in a riot, maintaining a public nuisance, and conspiracy to endanger by fire and explosion.A day before the violence, as reported by AMI Newswire , opponents of the pipeline barricaded a highway and pitched their camp on private land. These actions were led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.The previous weekend some 127 people had been arrested.Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II issued a statement last week in which he blamed the rising militarization of police for the increased tensions.""The militarization of local law enforcement and enlistment of multiple law enforcement agencies from neighboring states is needlessly escalating violence and unlawful arrests against peaceful protesters at Standing Rock,"" Archambault said, as quoted by AMI Newswire . ""We do not condone reports of illegal actions, but believe the majority of peaceful protesters are reacting to strong-arm tactics and abuses by law enforcement."" Destruction of burial grounds, water are chief concerns Law enforcement officers countered by saying that, for the vast majority of the protest thus far, they have shown remarkable patience and restraint, and that they only moved after protestors became more aggressive.Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier ticked off a list of alleged violations by protestors, including buzzing a police helicopter with a drone and firing arrows in the direction of officers. He also said that journalists had been harassed and security personnel assaulted.""For months protesters have described us as an aggressive police force,"" Kirchmeier said in a prepared statement, AMI Newswire reported. ""We have done nothing but demonstrate patience and restraint.""Protestors are angry about the pipeline stretching across ancient burial grounds, NewsTarget reported , as well as the potential for pipeline leaks that would pollute local water sources .

Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: Amy Goodrich Tags: cold symptoms , natural remedies , immune booster (NaturalNews) Stay well during the colder months with these simple, time-tested home remedies to prevent a common cold, help shorten the duration and get you feeling better in no time. A common cold is caused by a virus, so there is no point in taking antibiotics which only kill bacteria. While there is a host of over-the-counter remedies available to soothe the symptoms of a common cold, nature offers far better and safer solutions.We all know the prevention drill. Load up on immune boosting foods rich in vitamin C , exercise regularly and wash your hands often. But what else is there you can do to avoid a runny nose, sore throat or a cough? Seven Health editors reveal their sickness-preventing secrets. Gargle salt water If you feel the first signs of a scratchy throat, Jeannie Kim, executive deputy editor, recommends a salt-water gargle. She is convinced that it has stopped countless of her colds. To soothe a sore throat and kill the sick-making germs, combine half a teaspoon salt with one cup of water and gargle. Repeat several times a day until scratchiness disappears. Create some heat According to Clare McHugh, editor-in-chief, a hot bath or shower is the thing you need. She explains that viruses that cause a common cold don't like the heat and are discouraged to multiply if you keep your body warm. And why not add immune boosting and cold fighting essential oils to your bathtub to enhance the healing effect?Furthermore, you could try the good old hot water bottle to help loosen phlegm and deep congestions in the chest. Swallow raw garlic If you don't mind to sweat it out and have a garlic breath, Lisa Lombardi, executive editor, recommends eating or swallowing raw garlic. While the next day her symptoms usually get worse, she feels better in 3 days.If you cannot stomach garlic's taste and spiciness, then you might want to go with the traditional garlic cure which consists of garlic, lemon, and honey. Crush one clove of garlic and add it to a cup of warm water with one teaspoon of honey and the juice of one lemon. Give it a good stir and repeat this remedy two to three times a day for the duration of your symptoms. Take Echinacea Michael Gollust, the research editor, swears by echinacea lozenges. He says that while they don't stop a cold in its tracks, they definitely reduce the severity of the symptoms. The BBC, however, reports on a comprehensive review that scanned the literature and included only the very best studies, showing that people who use echinacea may also have 10 to 20 percent less chance to catch a common cold. Stay hydrated Most Health experts agree that hydration is essential for a speedy recovery. Anthea Levi, the editorial assistant, adds that if you are struggling with blocked sinuses, adding lemon juice and cayenne pepper to your glass of water is all you need to breathe freely again. Go to bed early They often say sleep is one the best natural doctors. Tomoko Takeda Canel, the acting beauty director, couldn't agree more. When she gets sick, she cancels all her plans, has a light meal and then prioritizes an early bedtime to get better.Next time you get a cold, keep these tips and tricks in mind, and you won't need over-the-counter drugs that can do more harm than good.

Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: Vicki Batts Tags: FDA , ADHD drugs , market withdrawal (NaturalNews) ADHD medications have been subject to public scrutiny for quite some time. Two years ago, the FDA said it had discovered problems with a generic version of a popular ADHD drug known as Concerta. The generic, produced by the pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt, just wasn't up to snuff. And now, the FDA seems to finally be making moves to pull this inferior product off the shelves.Generic drugs are approved by the FDA through their abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) process. In the ANDA process, the federal agency is primarily focused on data that shows the generic drug is a bioequivalent for the reference listed drug, or what many people refer to as the ""brand name"" drug.The term ""bioequivalent"" means that there is no substantial differences in bioavailability between a generic drug and the brand name product. Specifically, it suggests that the extent and rate of absorption of two drug equivalents over the same period of time, at the same dose and under the same conditions, should exhibit similar results. As the FDA explains on their website, ""The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patient's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the pioneer drug.""Unsurprisingly, discrepancies in actual equivalence are often discovered after a generic has been approved.Mallinckrodt's Concerta generic is not the only brand name knock-off under fire. Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of the Lannett Company, also manufactures a generic form of the medication that the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has deemed insufficient.As reported by the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society: CDER tracked the issues from December 2013 through June 2014, ran a re-analysis of bioequivalence data and ""determined that the Mallinckrodt product may deliver methylphenidate into the body at a slower rate than Concerta during the time period of 7 to 12 hours post-dosing."" Following the CDER's findings, Mallinckrodt filed a lawsuit, which was thrown out by a Maryland federal judge. The pharmaceutical company has since declined to voluntarily withdraw their product from the marketplace. And according to the FDA, the drug manufacturer has yet to submit any new data or information that confirms the bioequivalence of their product to Concerta.Similarly, the CDER concluded in June of 2014 that the data on the Kremers product is insufficient to determine whether or not their generic product is therapeutically equivalent to Concerta. In November that year, the FDA announced that their product was not sufficiently equivalent to the name brand.Both manufacturers may submit a request for a hearing to the FDA within the next month so they can attempt to show why approval for their drugs shouldn't be withdrawn.Of course, the FDA's concerns about the apparent lack of efficacy seen in these generic drugs is rather ironic, given the magnitude of other concerns surrounding these drugs. In 2006, a CBS News report revealed that 25 people died and 54 more suffered serious cardiovascular problems following the use of ADHD medication, in a period of just four years.That may not seem like a lot, but is important to recall that the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which is used to track such events, is a voluntary system. Only drug manufacturers are required to report adverse events ‚Äì if they know about them. Doctors, patients and family members are under no such obligation. PSQH reports that drug safety experts estimate that only about 10 percent of all adverse events will even be reported ‚Äì who is to say how many people have been harmed by ADHD medications (and other drugs) and don't know it or haven't reported it?The FAERS website itself states that because of its own limitations, ""FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the U.S. population."" And yet, in spite of this very statement, the FDA itself used this information to form a safety report?Over the years, several ADHD medications, like Adderall XR, have been linked to sudden death , cardiovascular problems and psychosis. According to Consumer Reports , the long-term safety of these drugs has not been evaluated or studied sufficiently, and there is evidence to suggest that the benefit of such drugs wears off after about two years. Many kids take ADHD medication for quite a bit longer than that.In spite of all of this, the FDA has yet to pull these drugs from the shelves, and is instead concerned with drugs that aren't strong enough. Medications that don't work obviously don't belong in the marketplace. However, drugs that are killing children don't belong there either.

Posted Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 03:54pm EDT 
Joint pain prevents us from exercising or doing simple tasks like walking. Unfortunately, it only gets worse as we age. This happens because the fluid (synovial fluid) in the joints reduces as we age. Reduction of this fluid increases friction on the joints and leads to arthritis. 
But research also shows that uric acid can cause arthritis. Build-up of uric acid in the joints can damage joint tissues and cause pain. The build-up happens when the kidneys don‚Äôt excrete enough uric acid. It can also be triggered by the body converting purines to uric acid fast. Long-term build-up of uric acid can cause inflammation and reduce your mobility. 
Switch to an Alkaline Diet 
There‚Äôs been a never-ending argument about whether alkaline diets reduce acidity in the body or not. In fact, some experts have discredited them as useless. But what does research say? Well, this study found that alkaline diet enhances excretion of uric acid through urine. On the other hand, researchers found that acidic foods reduce excretion of uric acid. 
Another study affirms that alkaline diets can help reduce uric acid in the body. And they can prevent uric acid crystallization in joints. 
Note that more research needs to be conducted on effect of diet on uric acid crystal. 
Eat these alkaline foods 
You simply need to reduce intake of acidic foods and eat more alkaline foods. Alkaline foods are mostly vegetables and legumes.

I‚Äôm sure you have heard about fermented foods and are wondering if this is just a fad. Here are some reasons why fermented foods should not be just a fad but a food group to keep in your diet daily. What are Fermented Foods? 
Bacteria and yeast are used as part of the fermentation process that gives these foods a nutritional boost. The bacteria convert sugars and starches into lactic acid through a process called lacto-fermentation. The yeast undergoes a process called ethanol fermentation. 
These yeasts and bacteria that undergo the fermentation process boosts the nutritional content of the food. What it does to the food Provides beneficial bacteria that promote gut health Provides beneficial enzymes Increases the amount of B vitamins, biotin, and folate. Increases the bioavailability of minerals. Provides short chain fatty acids (which helps to improve your immune function) Provides you with GABA, your calming neurotransmitter How can eating fermented foods help me? Optimize your Gut Health 
Why this may not seem like a big deal, it is. Your immune system is in your gut and much of your serotonin is made in your gut. Your gut may be in bad shape from NSAIDS, antibiotics, unknown food allergies, the standard American diet and more. 
Ideally you want more ‚Äúgood‚Äù bacteria populating your gut as opposed to ‚Äúbad‚Äù bacteria. Fermented foods can help shift the balance since most people who consume the Standard American ‚Äúcrap food‚Äù diet have a disrupted microbiome. 
So, you can take all the supplements in the world, but if your gut is in bad shape, are you even absorbing and benefiting from these supplements or are you just wasting your money? 
A healthy gut can help to balance and support your endocrine system, immune system, digestive system, and nervous system. So, as you can see, a healthy gut is critical to your well-being. Support your Immune System 
The more beneficial bacteria you have, the stronger your immune system is to fight off colds, flu, allergies and more. Almost 80% of your immune system is found in your gut, thus, it stands to reason that to maintain a strong immune system, one needs to support their gut health. 
Asthma and autoimmune conditions, among numerous other health issues, are all linked to having fewer good bacteria in your gut. The less diverse your microbiota is, the greater association with many chronic health issues. 
Adding in probiotic rich fermented foods can also shorten the duration of a cold or upper respiratory infection. Aid in weight loss 
Studies show that those with certain healthy bacteria in their gut can maintain a healthy weight while those with more negative strains have a greater incidence of gaining weight/difficulty losing weight. Obese people have different gut bacteria than lean individuals. 
In a 2011 study, it was found that kimchee had a significant impact on weight and body fat of those who are overweight and obese in the study. In a 2010 study, obese people were assigned to drink fermented milk for 12 weeks. Those that drank the fermented milk had significant fat loss as compared to the control group. Digestive/Bowel Issue Improvement 
Those with IBS or IBD may have reduced symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when fermented foods are added into the daily diet. Dr. David Williams states that to eliminate digestive issues, you need to improve the balance in the gut microbiome and one of the most effective ways of doing so is by adding in fermented foods. Kefir in studies, has shown to improve symptoms of IBS and IBD. Research has shown that anywhere from 50 to 75% of those who make this change (Adding in fermented foods) will notice a significant difference in their IBS symptoms. Improved mental health, mood control and behavior. 
The gut is considered your second brain. A healthy gut therefore can mean a healthy brain. Several probiotic strains have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in short term studies. For this reason, to get more variety of probiotic strains, it is best to not stick with the same fermented food to eat over and over. Mix it up; for instance, have kefir one day, kombucha the next, fermented vegetables the next day and so forth. 
Many of you know that GABA is your calming neurotransmitter. But did you know that fermented foods can supply you with GABA too? Oral administration of fermented rice bran and other traditional fermented foods have been shown to increase GABA content significantly! Whereas GABA in the oral form may have limited benefits due to absorption issues. 
Another study looking at 700 college students found that those who ate a variety of fermented foods has less negative emotions than before such as anxiety, fear, moodiness, worry, envy, frustration, and loneliness. 
It is possible that the fermented foods not only healed leaky gut but also provided some needed GABA. Even in psychiatry they are starting to recognize the benefits of fermented foods for mood disorders. Reduce the risk of brain diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs. 
Some scientists have recently begun to consider the possibility that Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease is in fact an autoimmune disease. And as many of you may know, having one autoimmune condition puts you at risk for more autoimmune conditions down the road. For any autoimmune disease, the immune system must be supported. So, it would make sense that gut health needs to be addressed for AD. If you want to support your brain than I suggest that you add in fermented foods. 
Along with the benefits above, fermented foods can also benefit those with Autism and help prevent H-Pylori. You don‚Äôt need a whole lot of fermented foods daily. Start with small amounts until you know how your body will react and slowly build your way up to say 3 tablespoons of fermented vegetables or a cup of kefir per day. What to add in 
Look for the product to say raw and fermented. These foods should be in the refrigerator section of the store. Sauerkraut or other fermented vegetables : eat these cold, don‚Äôt heat them up. Bubbies pickles is a great way to get introduced to fermented foods. Kimchee : this is a Korean version of fermented cabbage, carrots, onions and garlic. Kefir: usually made from cow‚Äôs milk but is also made from goat milk or coconut milk. It has more of a drinkable texture than yogurt. I buy goat milk kefir and find that it is relatively thick and mix in some of my paleo granola and have this for breakfast. If you suspect any issues with milk it is best to opt for the coconut kefir or the goat milk kefir. If you have asthma or chronic sinus congestion, avoid the kefir until issues resolve. Opt for the other fermented choices instead. Tempeh: Indonesian type of ‚Äúcake‚Äù with a nutty taste and chewy texture. A good vegan source of protein too. Kombucha : a fizzy fermented tea. Most stores carry a variety of flavors now. Don‚Äôt go overboard on the kombucha however. Some people who drink kombucha in excess amounts (i.e.: several bottles per day) report symptoms of gas and bloating. Miso: a fermented soybean paste which can be used in soups and sauces. A miso broth soup is a great way to start a meal and very easy to make. 
Notice I did not sat yogurt. While some yogurts may contain some probiotics, many others are sugary processed foods in disguise. Yogurt is also not going to pack as powerful of a punch as the above-mentioned foods.

What if I told you that by doing this every day, making it part of your morning routine just like brushing your teeth, would help you to lose weight, flush out toxins, hydrate your body and skin, improve brain function, give you more energy and decrease your appetite, would you do it? 
Drinking water upon rising in the morning can have huge health benefits! Some people call it water therapy and has its origination in Ayurvedic medicine. It is purported to help with numerous diseases such as cancer, asthma, high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes and migraines. 
To reap the benefits, drink the water upon waking (ideally 45 minutes before you eat) and make it part of your morning routine. Most us are walking around in a dehydrated state. So, start your day off the right way! 
Ideally filtered water that is void of chemicals and fluoride is best. I personally like the Berkey filter system as this is affordable for many instead of a whole house system. Most water pitchers are ineffective for removing most of the chemicals in our water but there are a couple good ones out there such as the ‚ÄúClearly Filtered‚Äù pitcher. But even if you don‚Äôt have a water filter system, it does not mean you should not drink up. 
For most people 16 oz. of water in the morning is the right amount. Others say to drink double this amount. This may be a lot of water to consume for most people first thing in the morning. My suggestion would be to start out with 8 oz. and slowly work your way up to the higher amount and see how you feel. Moderation is key as too little or too much water is never a good thing. 
The 8 glasses filled with 8 oz. of water is a myth and no science behind this reasoning. Another simple rule is to divide your body weight in half and drink this amount in ounces. But if you are a large person, this may feel like you are spending your day drinking water! 
Instead focus on getting that glass of water first thing in the day and then add in water, herbal teas, fruits and vegetables during the day. If your urine is very pale yellow throughout the day, then you are hydrated. If it is a bright yellow to orange, drink up! Riboflavin, a B vitamin can make your urine a bright yellow. Benefits to drinking water first thing in the morning It can jump start your metabolism 
It can increase your metabolism by 24% for the first 90 minutes after consuming that glass of water. Another study showed that it can increase your metabolic rate by 30% for the next 40 minutes after the water is consumed. Hydration This is more important that you think. When dehydrated, we may experience brain fog, lack of energy and metal clarity. Hydrating in the morning can increase the flow of oxygen which is energizing. Hydrating will also help the skin to look younger. Flushes out toxins 
Support your kidneys by helping them to flush out toxins and give your body the water it needs first thing in the a.m. Speed up the detox process by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice to your morning water. This is best done prior to brushing your teeth in the morning as the film on your teeth will protect the enamel from the acidity in the lemon juice. Support brain health 
Your brain tissue is 75% water. Not having enough water can make you feel tired, drained and can cause mood swings. Prevent you from overeating Just by drinking water you feel full. Studies show that those who consume water before every meal lost an average of 4.5 pounds over a three-month period. That‚Äôs with no dieting, not changing your eating habits-just adding in water. Less colds and Flu 
Staying hydrated helps to maintain the health of your lymphatic system which also affects how your body fights off infection. 
If you are looking for a simple, cheap and effective way to improve your health and stimulate weight loss, then this is it!

Cranberry juice and tablets have been recommended as a way to either prevent recurring urinary tract infection (UTI), or treat the symptoms. But a new study finds there‚Äôs no difference between people treated with cranberries or placebos. 
A lack of evidence for cranberry juice or capsules as being an effective preventative measure or treatment has been a recurring argument in the scientific literature for years now. Cranberry Juice ‚Äì An Unrealistic Recommendation for UTIs 
A urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria gets into your urine and travels up to your bladder. According to the Urinary Care Foundation , ‚ÄúUTIs cause more than 8.1 million visits to health care providers each year. About 10 in 25 women and 3 in 25 men will have symptoms of at least [one] UTI during their lifetime.‚Äù 
For years now, cranberry juice has been recommended to aid in preventing or treating UTIs. However, there‚Äôs no solid evidence that any amount is having a positive effect. 
Additionally, based on the results of a recent study led by infectious disease specialist Manisha Juthani-Mehta from the Yale School of Medicine, even if you switch to highly concentrated capsules, you still don‚Äôt see a noticeable positive effect. 
In response to this recent study, Lindsay E. Nicolle, an expert on UTIs from the University of Manitoba advises the following: 
‚ÄúThe continuing promotion of cranberry use to prevent recurrent UTI in the popular press or online advice seems inconsistent with the reality of repeated negative studies or positive studies compromised by methodological shortcomings.‚Äù 
Nicolle adds, ‚Äú[C]linicians should not be promoting cranberry use by suggesting that there is proven, or even possible benefit. Any continued promotion of the use of cranberry products seems to go beyond available scientific evidence and rational reasoning. It is time to move on from cranberries.‚Äù Myth versus Facts 
There‚Äôs a couple of reasons why the myth that cranberry juice is beneficial in preventing and treating UTIs has persisted for so long. 
First, the active ingredient in cranberries ‚Äî A-type proanthocyanidins (PACs) ‚Äî has been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to the wall of the bladder. So, a vast majority of people have reasoned that if bacteria are causing UTIs, something that blocks bacteria from accumulating in the bladder could be a potential preventive or treatment measure. 
But, according to Timothy Boone, M.D., Ph.D., vice dean of the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine Houston campus and chairperson of the department of urology for Houston Methodist Hospital, there‚Äôs one problem . 
‚ÄúCranberry juice, especially the juice concentrates you find at the grocery store, will not treat a UTI or bladder infection, It can offer more hydration and possibly wash bacteria from your body more effectively, but the active ingredient in cranberry is long-gone by the time it reaches your bladder.‚Äù 
Dr. Boone adds, ‚ÄúIt takes an extremely large concentration of cranberry to prevent bacterial adhesion. This amount of concentration is not found in the juices we drink. There‚Äôs a possibility it was stronger back in our grandparents‚Äô day, but definitely not in modern times.‚Äù 
For example, Ocean Spray‚Äôs cranberry juice cocktail is only 27 percent juice. Something so watered down could not be so ineffective. 
The second reason the myth continues is that it‚Äôs a tempting myth to believe. If you experience recurring UTIs and want to prevent them ‚Äî or you want to feel empowered while you‚Äôre waiting for the antibiotics to take effect ‚Äî drinking cranberry juice or taking capsules is a fairly easy and simple way to feel like you‚Äôre helping resolve your problem. 
Unfortunately, though, you‚Äôre paying a lot of money for something that‚Äôs only really doing the same job as a glass of water. And cranberry juice is full of sugar anyway. Golden Rules for Kidney Health 
You can do a number of things to help keep your kidneys functioning properly at every stage of life. 
Here‚Äôs a list of ways to reduce the risk of kidney disease ‚Äì including urinary tract infections. Drink plenty of liquids, especially water . Drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that you‚Äôll urinate more frequently ‚Äî allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin. Stay active and keep fit . Keeping fit helps to reduce your blood pressure. Staying active and keeping fit also reduces the risk of chronic kidney disease. Eat healthy and keep your weight in check . This can help prevent diabetes, heart disease, and other debilitating conditions associated with chronic kidney disease. Reduce your salt intake . The recommended sodium intake is 5-6 grams of salt per day ‚Äî around a teaspoon. Try limiting the amount of processed and restaurant food. And don‚Äôt add salt to food. It‚Äôs easier to control your salt intake if you prepare the food yourself with fresh ingredients. Don‚Äôt take over-the-counter pills on a regular basis . Common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ‚Äî like ibuprofen ‚Äî are known to cause kidney damage and disease if taken regularly. This type of medication probably doesn‚Äôt pose considerable danger if your kidneys are reasonably healthy and you use them for emergencies only. However, if you are dealing with chronic pain ‚Äî like back pain or arthritis ‚Äî work with your doctor to find natural ways to control your pain without putting your kidneys at risk. Wipe from front to back . Doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra. Change your birth control method . Diaphragms, or unlubricated or spermicide-treated condoms, can all contribute to bacterial growth. Avoid potentially irritating feminine products . Using deodorant sprays or other feminine products, such as douches and powders, in the genital area can irritate the urethra. Empty your bladder soon after intercourse . Also, drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria. Regularly control of your blood sugar level . About half of people who have diabetes develop kidney damage, so it is important for people with diabetes to have regular tests to check their kidney functions.

Tuesday, November 01, 2016 Tags: Donna Brazile , cheating democrats , racketeering (NaturalNews) Dirty Donna Brazile. Political filth on display. The stench of dirty democrat tactics has now reached a new, nauseating milestone in America with the revelation that ""Dirty"" Donna Brazile, a DNC operative working for Clinton, smuggled debate questions out of CNN and handed them over to the Clinton camp before the debates ever took place so that Hillary Clinton could CHEAT.Yes, Hillary Clinton CHEATED in the debates. As I've said all along, they were 100% rigged by CNN, the ""Clinton News Network,"" which now functions as the propaganda front of the criminal Clinton cartel seeking to steal power by crushing the very concept of open, fair and free elections in America.""CNN commentator Donna Brazile, who is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee, [was] caught again passing debate questions from the network to the Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary,"" reports Breitbart.com .Dirty Donna Brazile was caught so blatantly that even CNN had to fire her to create the appearance that CNN is still engaged in something resembling ethical journalism. Funneling town hall and debate questions to Hillary Clinton days before the events... The Daily Caller adds even more stunning revelations to the depths of cheating carried out by Dirty Donna Brazile on behalf of the corrupt, criminal-minded Clintons: Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show.The email threads also show that Brazile, a former CNN contributor, revealed to the Clinton campaign the name of the person who provided her with a question that was asked of Clinton at a March 13 town hall co-hosted by CNN and TV One. Brazile also shared a question from a debate hosted by CNN a week earlier.A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN's Jake Tapper.A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich. ARREST Brazile, Mills, Podesta, Schultz, Abedin and Clinton What we are all witnessing here with these revelations about cheating, corruption, obstruction of justice, bribery and vote fraud is nothing less than the inner workings of a criminal cartel composed of a modern day political mafia .All these political scumbags need to go to jail. They are all guilty of serious crimes against the United States and against democracy itself. They respect no law. They follow no rules. They cheat, lie, deceive, steal and intimidate their way to power, election after election. They live as legally immune parasites feeding off the blood, sweat and tears of the American middle class who are barely staying afloat while Washington elitists like Brazile, Abedin and Clinton dine on luxury meals like a disturbing scene out of the Hunger Games .But it's not President Snow we have to worry about in the real world... it's the haunting possibility of a President Clinton. Why We the People must NEVER allow Hillary Clinton to seize the White House We the People must never allow Hillary Clinton to seize the White House. We must halt this sociopathic liar and cheater at the ballot box on November 8th. And once that's accomplished, we must petition President Trump to relentlessly pursue criminal indictments of the HUNDREDS of seditious traitors inside the Clinton regime who have blatantly violated numerous federal laws to commit massive fraud and attempted theft of power across America.There are literally hundreds of these democrat criminals who need to be locked up for life. They are a danger to democracy and a danger to a free society. They are sociopaths, liars, cheats and even murderers. They are fraudsters and political con artists who prey upon the weak-minded (i.e. democrats who are still so stupid and clueless that they're voting for Hillary ). If we don't stop them now, they threaten to turn America into a Fourth Reich , complete with the mass murder of political dissidents and the silencing of all critics of the Clinton regime.These democrats like Dirty Donna Brazile want to run America like Haiti , complete with all the corruption, bribery, scandals and economic collapse that Third World countries routinely suffer.But filthy scumbags like Brazile are about to find out something rather shocking: We the People won't tolerate your lies and corruption any longer! We the People are going to arrest you, indict you, prosecute you and see you and your co-conspirators behind bars where you belong. The Trump movement is awakening tens of millions of Americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in Washington There's an unstoppable movement rising up in America now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power. If they steal the election, we will take to the streets and declare a Clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal . We will stand behind the military men and women in uniform as the U.S. armed forces depose you and remove you from office , to announce new elections without the festering, cancerous stench of the DNC and the Clintons hanging over this nation like a putrid cloud of filth.We the People have had enough of you demons, you creatures from Hell, you walking bags of anti-human reptilian snakes who pretend to be ""leaders"" in Washington. Your days of tyranny and totalitarian domination are rapidly coming to an end. And you will soon face the informed justice of an enraged population that refuses to be enslaved by your incessant corruption and wretched government rackets.From Breitbart.com : Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton's abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a ""racketeering enterprise,"" which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained:Under RICO, an ""enterprise"" can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate ¬ñ it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through ""a pattern of racketeering activity."" A ""pattern"" means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute ""racketeering activity"" if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute. It's time to defeat Clinton , followed by arresting all the Clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these Third World fraudsters. That's how we take back America, restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order. NOTE TO THE FEDS: Arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in America REMEMBER: If federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the Clintons and all their co-conspirators, they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority. At that point, the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes, obey federal laws, abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in Washington at all.After all, a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law. At that point, ""justice"" becomes a sad, tragic joke against the citizens, and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens' revolt. If the FBI won't seek criminal indictments against Hillary Clinton and her criminal cohorts, sooner or later the military or the citizens will do it for them .

Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: L.J. Devon, Staff Writer Tags: heart failure , pain management , antioxidants (NaturalNews) When elderly patients with joint problems start taking common painkillers such as ibuprofen and naproxen, their risk of heart failure increases. This is the finding of a UK study published in the British Medical Journal . The study investigated 10 million people with an average age of 77 from the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. Those who took non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were rushed to the hospital with heart failure 19 percent more often than those who did not take the drugs. The same awful correlation was not made for those under the age of 65, but the study does point out that serious health problems are being ignored and numbed by painkillers. Dealing with the root cause of inflammation is more important for long-term health Regular use of NSAIDs is becoming a popular strategy to help manage pain later in life. Using these over-the-counter painkillers may take the edge off the pain, but continued use does not deal with the problems that are causing the inflammation in the first place. And old age is not the reason for the pain.For this reason, elderly patients could benefit more from natural anti-inflammatory substances that work with the body's healing process. Over time, giving the body phyto-nutrients such as astaxanthin, curcumin and capsicum do much greater damage repair than NSAIDs. These plant based medicines go after the free radicals that are causing damage at the cellular level.Numbing the pain is not enough, and allows heart conditions to go unnoticed, leading to heart failure . Pain within the joints and tissues is a signal to the conscious self that there is indeed a breakdown, an imbalance, or a deficiency. When NSAIDs are thrown at the problem regularly, there can only be a numbing of the real problems that the elderly patient faces. When the correct nutrients are absorbed and toxins are removed, then the root problem sending the message of pain can be repaired. Better pain management essential for the elderly Flu shots and other vaccines containing aluminum are pushed on the elderly as ""medicine."" The aluminum acts as an inflammatory adjuvant to trigger the immune system to respond to the virus material in the vaccine. The inflammation and genetic damage that aluminum is known to cause may be exacerbating pain in elderly patients and causing damage to their nervous systems.Natural substances that repair the nervous and immune systems would be better advised for the elderly population. However, the medical system and the common patient do not understand how to use substances such as phenolic compounds that come from plants. These real life medicines possess antioxidant properties that act as therapeutic agents to counteract oxidative stress. Something as simple as Siberian ginseng ( Eleutherococcus senticosus ) can be included in the diet to provide greater mental and physical stamina. This root contains a powerful combination of sterols, coumarins, flavonoids and polysaccharides that lessen the effect of stress on the body, allowing one to adapt to high stress situations and manage pain more effectively.

Monday, October 31, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: Zika virus , medical hoax , infectious disease (NaturalNews) One of the most interesting things about the Zika virus is that it is not a new ailment. It was first discovered in monkeys in 1947 and in humans in 1952, according to a fact sheet from the World Health Organization .While researchers have admittedly probably learned more about the virus since it was first identified, some of the health problems now being associated with Zika ‚Äì such as microcephaly in newborns ‚Äì have never before been seen, leaving many to wonder if there isn't some sort of conspiracy being devised by globalists to suit their political agenda.For instance, according to TruthWiki , an investigative site that has recently delved into the history of the disease, populations in the past that were heavily infected with Zika never reported a single case of a newborn with a shrunken head. The current outbreak is far from being the only one. In the 1960s, outbreaks occurred in Oceania and Southeast Asia. And in 2007, the so-called ""Yap epidemic,"" which occurred on the Yap main island ‚Äì part of the Caroline Island chain in the Western Pacific ‚Äì infected three-quarters of the population. But no cases of newborn birth defects, like microcephaly, were reported. So the current hysteria over microcephaly allegedly being tied to Zika appears completely unwarranted. Will we see another 'swine flu fiasco' with the Zika vaccine? The same year, TruthWiki reported, using funding that was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a genetically altered version of the virus was developed by Oxitec (Oxford Insect Technologies), a British biotechnology company. Roughly two years later, in the fall of 2009, Gates helped usher in the first outdoor trials of genetically modified transgenic Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are the species known to transmit the disease. They were released ostensibly to fight the spread of mosquito-borne diseases including dengue, yellow fever and Zika , among others. The plan was to get the GM mosquitoes to mate with females to produce offspring that would die soon after birth, thereby halting the spread of the disease. But, TruthWiki noted, there was another agenda.In May 2014, the WHO and the Brazilian government colluded to spread propaganda that there were nearly 1 million ""suspected"" cases of Zika in Brazil, and recommended that the deadly poison pyroproxyfen be spread, to include areas of drinking water. The propaganda disseminated was that since mosquitoes were breeding in those areas of standing water, then they too had to be treated with the chemical, which was then spread primarily over poverty-stricken areas.The next thing we know, scores of cases involving microcephaly in Brazil began cropping up. And they were then blamed on Zika. Coincidence? Many think not. What's more, there were really only about 500 children born malformed ‚Äì not 5,000-plus as originally reported, TruthWiki points out.As TruthWiki notes further, Zika is a mild viral infection ‚Äì always has been ‚Äì and resembles the typical cold or flu. Most of those afflicted with it suffer a low-grade fever, some pain in their joints, a skin rash and conjunctivitis. In other cases, people have no idea they've even been infected. If symptoms appear at all, they may last up to a week. But like chicken pox, a one-time Zika infection can provide lifelong immunity. While severe cases of Zika may require hospitalization, they are rare, as are Zika-related deaths. Overkill? And yet, despite the virus' relatively mild symptoms, the U.S. government is set to pay a Japanese Big Pharma firm as much as $300 million to develop a vaccine , Natural News reported recently. If that's not overkill, then nothing is ‚Äì especially given the fact that most vaccines contain harmful substances and preservatives .Another disease outbreak ""emergency."" Another vaccine with even more harmful chemicals and preservatives will go on the market. In fact, due to the ""gravity"" and ""dire nature"" of the Zika emergency, we may even see mandatory vaccination as we did with the swine flu fiasco in the mid-1970s. Then, a mandatory program of vaccination for the illness, which only killed one person, led to a dramatic spike in Guillain-Barre syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the nerves, causing paralysis. Ironically, today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is claiming that Zika may be causing GBS.Propaganda anyone?Read the entire TruthWiki report on the Zika hoax here .

Wednesday, November 02, 2016 Tags: deep state , Clinton cartel , damning evidence (NaturalNews) My fellow Americans, we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime. As of today, I am now convinced that the deep state has turned on Hillary Clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the Clintons' reign of terror over America and collapse her bid for the presidency.The mainstream media, of course, will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal Clinton cartel. As such, they will lie to the public to the bitter end, even as the Clinton Titanic sinks with all of them on board (in deep, frigid waters, no less, with no more lifeboats to be found).The so-called ""deep state"" -- the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy -- has decided Hillary Clinton is too damaged to defend any longer . Even if she were to win by stealing the election, she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survival.It has now been decided, I believe, that Hillary Clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the NSA and FBI. This will likely happen before the coming weekend. Once that is accomplished, the next goal will be to wait for President Trump to take office, then destroy the U.S. economy through a controlled, global debt collapse so that Trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies. (Remember: The deep state isn't pro-Trump. They're still all about defending the establishment. But Hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomach...)Instead of allowing Hillary Clinton to take power and destroy America from the top, in other words, deep state power brokers have reverted to ""Plan B"" which is to let Trump take the White House, then destroy America through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy. This is simpler than it sounds. Bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly $20 trillion in national debt isn't exactly rocket science. All they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates. Monetary gravity will do the rest...In the mean time, Hillary Clinton and a long list of her co-conspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice , lying under oath, destruction of evidence, conspiracy, corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for many.The criminal racket of the Clintons is about to implode. The participants will be charged under the RICO Act for ""racketeering"" activities, for which ample evidence already exists. A new video from Steve Pieczenik describes some of this In this video, intelligence insider Steve Pieczenik lays out how high-level intelligence insiders are now working in concert to ""reverse the Clinton coup"" that's attempting to take over America and destroy it from within.Even if you don't believe Pieczenik -- and I fully realize he's controversial in his own way -- this short video is a very important ""must watch"" explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing... ""we've initiated a counter-coup..."" The Clintons are going to go ""full murder"" in a last ditch, desperate effort to save themselves Beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days. Like a cornered wild animal, the Clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going ""full murder"" in an attempt to save themselves.I will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week. Watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes, swimming pool accidents or ""natural"" deaths involving people like James Comey, who'd better have armed security personnel around him at all times.Look for desperate measures such as the Clintons attempting to blackmail Obama, Comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins. We might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days, although that's increasingly unlikely since it seems the Clintons are now on their own (they would need the assistance of Obama to pull off another Sandy Hook, you see). A deal has already been struck with Obama Most likely, deep state operatives have already struck a deal with Obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as Hillary Clinton's head is served up on a platter. This likely explains why Obama is now publicly saying he trusts Comey (and refuses to go to bat for Hillary). There's no love lost between Obama and the Clintons (remember 2008?).As all this is going down, the propaganda ministry of the Clinton regime -- CNN, NYT, Washington Post, etc. -- is going to explode into an all-out ""bat-s##t crazy"" conspiracy theory phase where they blame the Russians, extraterrestrials, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster for everything that's imploding around the Clintons. Mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke. Maybe crop circles were created by the Russians as a secret code to Wikileaks and Donald Trump, eh?Meanwhile, conspiratorial operatives like George Stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition , so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put Hillary in the White House via any means at their disposal, including totally faking negative news against Donald Trump (which is, of course, the entire news mission of CNN at this point, a disgraced propaganda network run by anti-American traitors). If the vote is stolen for Hillary Clinton, all hell breaks loose Should the globalist Soros operators manage to steal the vote, bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place Hillary Clinton in the White House, all Hell breaks loose across America :‚Ä¢ The FBI goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the Clinton criminal regime.‚Ä¢ Donald Trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome, dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud, the rigging of voting machines, the attempted bribery of Electoral voters and so on.‚Ä¢ The U.S. military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose Clinton and restore democracy. This one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated... (and yes, YOU will beg for a short-term military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose Clinton and restore open, fair and free elections).‚Ä¢ Armed U.S. citizens prepare for a massive march on Washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite don't get away with corruption, fraud and murder. Expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds.‚Ä¢ The NSA likely goes into ""full dump"" mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against Hillary Clinton. This will likely be joined by CIA assets who already have the goods on the Clintons and their ""Lolita Express"" pedo joy rides.‚Ä¢ Wikileaks, Anonymous and every former NSA analyst goes into ""destroy the Clintons"" mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the Clintons and anyone close to them. Anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help. (I expect Kim Dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well, as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward Hillary Clinton... as do we all, come to think of it.)‚Ä¢ The establishment Republicans in the U.S. Congress will, as usual, meekly surrender to the democrats, pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because that's what they do best when the going gets tough. Totally useless politicrats like John McCain can't get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something. These useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of Washington as the revolution unfolds, replaced with individuals who actually honor the U.S. Constitution (like Rep. Louie Gohmert). I root for all groups working to save America and expose the criminal politicians Bring out the marshmallows and weiners, folks: This is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to U.S. history that anyone has witnessed in over 200 years. Try not to trip and ""face plant"" into the flames as all this unfolds. It might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready, since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get. (And thank God Hillary doesn't have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes, or she'd probably launch them just to change the narrative...)As for me, I'm with anybody who's trying to save America , restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison. Like almost everybody else, I've had enough of the lies, the corruption, the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in Washington D.C. who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much they're universally despised. The revolution is ON. Anonymous, Wikileaks, Project Veritas, the FBI and the NSA have all been activated. There's no stopping them now, and all the details of all the crimes of the Clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history, dirty deeds and all.Be warned, you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the Clintons really are. You will probably vomit. Health Ranger Approved AquaTru Water Filter Back in Stock

Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: food poverty , hunger , Obama administration (NaturalNews) A Democratic presidential nominee ‚Äì Hillary Clinton, who is by far the ""establishment candidate"" in this year's presidential race ‚Äì wants to take over from another Democratic president, Barack Obama. She is promising to carry on his ""successful"" economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them .And yet, by any true measure, the economy has been a disaster under Obama. Real growth has nearly flat-lined , real unemployment figures ‚Äì when a proper count is taken ‚Äì is far higher than what is being ""officially"" posted by the administration , and 43 million Americans cannot get enough food without government assistance.In fact, on that last point and as reported by Natural Blaze , in the Obama economy, 1-in-6 Americans are going to bed hungry on most nights, if not every night.And Clinton wants to double down on Obama's economic policies? How can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry Americans? For the past eight years, Americans have had to listen to lectures from Obama (and other Democrats) about how we, as a first-world nation, should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens (and, increasingly, to non-citizens ). But shouldn't a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people too?Of course. But malnutrition during the ""great economic recovery"" of the Obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the U.S. That's because in real terms, workers' wages are falling, and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tables.""For many, particularly the low paid [sic], this means two things: fuel and food poverty ,"" Natural Blaze reported.Low salaries combined with stagnant wages, jobs going to illegal immigrants and part-time work rising as Obamacare forces fewer companies to retain full-time employees, mean that food is increasingly seen as a luxury. And of those who can still afford food, many have to settle for cheap, nutrition-poor junk foods and foods high in starches, carbohydrates and calories. Now, winter approaches, and with it the inevitable supply challenges of natural gas and heating oil, which traditionally produce higher prices.But the establishment media is part of the problem. For example, in February Bloomberg reported that 1-in-7 Americans were on food stamps, despite an economic recovery . No one should ever be hungry in America unless they choose to be What recovery? Obama's economy is growing at about 1‚Äì2 percent a quarter ‚Äì far below what is needed to sustain economic growth to the extent that it would lower our debt and provide well-paying jobs to the tens of millions needing them.So, the caveat is disingenuous. A more accurate story would have reflected on the 1-in-7 figure as it pertained to a real lack of opportunity among Americans to find better employment opportunities. In fact, the story makes no sense when you analyze it; either the economy is really good and a 1-in-7 ratio is no big deal, or the ratio is a big deal because the so-called economic recovery isn't reaching enough people. Which is it?It's the latter of course. And while America will always have a portion of the population that is too sick, too old or too lazy to produce ‚Äì and they will be a net drain on the Treasury ‚Äì the goal of any administration ought to be to adopt sound financial policies or to rescind policies that serve as impediments to economic growth. In today's America, that generally means thinning out the massive bureaucracy that is not only robbing millions of a better life because of their negative impact on business and industry, but is actually causing them to go hungry.And that should never happen in America. So why is it?

Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags: talc , ovarian cancer , jury award (NaturalNews) Once again, a St. Louis jury has ruled that Johnson & Johnson damaged women's health by engaging in a decades-long coverup about the potential risks of talcum powder (""baby powder"") as a feminine hygiene product. On October 27, Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $70.1 million to Deborah Giannecchini of Modesto, California, who received an ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2012.For 40 years, Giannecchini had used Johnson & Johnson's Baby Powder to keep her genital area dry, a use promoted by the company.The main ingredient in talcum powder is talc, a mineral widely used in paints and plastics as well as cosmetics, where it is used to absorb moisture. Some evidence suggests that regular exposure to talc, particularly in the genital area, can increase the risk of ovarian cancer.The jury found Johnson & Johnson guilty of negligence for failing to warn customers of this fact. Conspiracy to conceal risks Ovarian cancer is a rare but highly lethal disease. Well-established risk factors include obesity, not having children, estrogen therapy after menopause, and a family history of ovarian or breast cancer.The evidence linking talc to ovarian cancer is compelling but not yet conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer lists talc as a ""possible"" carcinogen.Among the robust studies suggesting a connection are two meta-analyses that found a roughly one-third increase in ovarian cancer risk among women who were regularly exposed to talc . The first, published in 2003, found the connection in all cases. The second, published in 2013, found it only in women who applied talc directly to the genital area.The case marks the third guilty verdict against Johnson & Johnson over this issue. St. Louis juries have previously slapped the company with $55 million and $72 million judgments.The first case was filed by the family of Jackie Fox of Birmingham, Alabama, who had died of ovarian cancer after long-term use of talcum powder. In that case, the jury found the company guilty not just of negligence, but also of ""failure to warn and conspiracy to conceal the risks of its products.""Another 2,000 lawsuits are pending. Thirty years of deception Even after the recent verdict, Johnson & Johnson continues to insist on the safety of its product, including for genital use. In its home state of New Jersey, the company has successfully gotten two lawsuits over the issue dismissed. It is appealing all three guilty verdicts from Missouri.Investors seem to believe the company will prevail. Its stock price seemed unaffected by the recent guilty verdict.Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research at Women's Voices for the Earth, has characterized Johnson and Johnson's behavior as typical of Big Pharma and other companies that go to extreme lengths to keep selling products even as evidence mounts of their dangers.Scranton said that documents uncovered during the Fox trial show that for decades, Johnson & Johnson sought to take advantage of the scientific uncertainty over the talc-ovarian cancer link, downplaying the potential risk rather than pursing a ""clearly more ethical role, to take a precautionary approach."" Indeed, Scranton notes, the company ""poured money over years into defending talc.""Among the documents revealed during the Fox case are internal memos showing that Johnson & Johnson had been preparing to be sued over the health risks of talc for 30 years. In one 1997 memo, a medical consultant warned that anyone who continued to deny a connection between ovarian cancer and genital talc use would eventually be seen as on par with tobacco companies denying a cancer link: ""denying the obvious in the face of all evidence to the contrary.""Another memo laid out a strategy to counter falling talc sales caused by health concerns by more aggressive marketing to minority communities.

Huff, staff writer Tags: Americans , life expectancy , plummeting health (NaturalNews) For many years, the assumption has been that the United States leads the world as an advanced civilization, dominating in categories like education, quality of life, and life expectancy. But a new study released this year by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) paints a much different picture, suggesting that Americans are less healthy and will more than likely live much shorter lives compared to those in previous generations.The 36-page report reveals that the average 65-year-old American man today will most likely die just short of his 86th birthday, while the average 65-year-old American woman only has about two years longer until she dies, on average, around age 88. This might not sound like anything out of the ordinary, except that these figures are actually down compared to last year's report using the same criteria.Over the past several years, the report explains, American health has taken a major downturn. Life expectancy amongst 65-year-olds is down by about six months, on average. It's also down for younger Americans, who are likewise expected to live about six months less than in previous generations. In nearly every generational category, including ""Baby Boomers,"" ""Generation X,"" and ""Millennials,"" life expectancy is down, and will likely continue to go down.This is especially the case among middle-aged, non-Hispanic whites, who a recent study by Princeton University found are increasingly succumbing to the detrimental effects of bad habits like alcohol and drug abuse, unhealthy diet, and lack of exercise. This report also highlights increasing rates of suicide within younger populations, a sad state of affairs that says even more about the current state of our society.Mortality rates are still rising, the data suggests, but at an increasingly lower rate. And if things continue on the current trajectory, eventually overall life expectancy will be on the downturn ‚Äì that is, unless the factors contributing to this decline are addressed and brought to bear. If they aren't, the average American life will likely continue to decline into the future. Pension payers, insurance companies see dollar signs as people die earlier While the study's findings have many applications in terms of social science research , the one area where they're making the biggest ripples involves employee pensions. By looking at this new life expectancy data through the lens of post-retirement disbursements, employers can determine whether or not their liabilities will increase or decrease ‚Äì and based on the most current data, it appears that a decrease is on the way.""The updated scale provides the latest information to help accurately measure pension obligations,"" says Dale Hall, managing director of research at the SOA. ""However, it is up to pension plan sponsors, working with their plan actuaries, to determine how to incorporate emerging mortality improvement data into their plan valuations.""With the growing popularity of 401k accounts as opposed to pensions , the new data can also help employees who handle their own retirement affairs better ascertain how much they need to make, and how much they need to save, to live comfortably until their deaths. All of this information makes a difference when determining the price of annuities and insurance contracts whereby insurance companies are obligated to pay out until the time a person dies.Year-over-year changes in mortality are very volatile,"" Hall adds, noting that something as simple as a bad flu season can disrupt the death rate averages.At the same time, some experts claim that longevity rates in the long-term are still on an upward trajectory, and that soon-to-be retirees and younger folks alike need to take into account the fact that they could live much longer than the latest figures suggest, and to plan accordingly.

Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: mushrooms , Monsanto , pesticides (NaturalNews) Is bio-agriculture giant Monsanto, king of genetically modified foods and seeds, about to suffer an irreversible decline while the planet Earth gets a huge chemical reprieve?Well, it may be a bit too early to declare the St. Louis-based corporation dead in the water, but that day may soon be upon us, thanks to a nifty new pesticide patent that would make BioAg chemicals unnecessary.As reported by the website Anonymous , one man who has dedicated his life to the study of mushrooms may have just stumbled upon the one invention that will dramatically change the way we protect food crops from voracious pests.Paul Stamets has unearthed medical cure after cure, and he says the key to saving the planet can be found in the mushroom.Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologists ‚Äì if not the top researcher of fungi ‚Äì filed a patent in 2001 that has since been all but ignored. Why? Because most of his research has been viewed as hostile to conventional industries, including the pesticide industry. Anonymous notes that some executives of the pesticide industry have remarked that the patent he filed was the most disruptive they had ever seen. Kills pests naturally and with zero impact on the environment And indeed, a read of the patent reveals a remarkable claim.""The present invention relates to the use of fungal mycelium as a biopesticide. More particularly, the invention relates to the control and destruction of insects, including carpenter ants, fire ants, termites, flies, beetles, cockroaches and other pests, using fungal mycelia as both attractant and infectious agent,"" the patent says.In other words, fungus that can be present on crops will both attract destructive pests and then infect and kill them after they have eaten it. In his patent, Stamets claims that more than one fungus can be used in combination, can be dried or freeze-dried, then packaged and reactivated for use ""as an effective bioinsecticide.""No more chemicals. No more spraying. No more need for Monsanto's chemical-first approach to growing our food.In his patent Stamets noted that the widespread use of chemical pesticides is a primary cause of a number of secondary environmental problems that occur besides the death of targeted pests. They include soil poisoning, the toxifying of underlying water tables and aquifers, as well as the pollution of surface water due to runoff.In addition, they lead to increases in cancer, allergies, neurological diseases, immune disorders Even the deaths of some agricultural workers and consumers have been linked to the use of chemical pesticides.Increasingly regulated and even banned in some countries, chemical pesticides like Monsanto's Roundup, with the cancer-causing primary ingredient glyphosate , have become so dangerous that many communities are scrambling for natural solutions to pest problems. Who knew mushrooms could be so lethal to pests? This guy did ""Compounding these problems, many pest type or vermin insects have developed a broad spectrum of resistance to chemical pesticides, resulting in few commercially available pesticides that are effective without thorough and repeated applications,"" the patent says. ""In addition to being largely ineffective and difficult and costly to apply, chemical pesticides present the further disadvantage of detrimental effects on non-target species, resulting in secondary pest outbreaks.""But his invention, he wrote, offers the agriculture industry an ""environmentally benign"" alternative to insect control by working to attract insects that latent preconidial mycelium that is fresh, dried or freeze-dried, that later infects and kills the host.Infected insects will then carry the fungal hyphae back to the central colony, then disperse the fungal pathogen even further.In essence, he wrote, fungal mycelium is both a bait/attractant as well as a food insecticide, and all without harming one thing in the environment.It's a harmless pesticide that works without genetically modifying our food, poisoning our earth and filling humans with toxins. Using just mushrooms.Now ‚Äì who will step up and market it? You can bet it won't be Monsanto.

Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by: Amy Goodrich Tags: lemon water , detox , digestive health (NaturalNews) Fruit-infused water is extremely trendy right now. Celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Beyonce swear by lemon water first thing in the morning. There are even entire diets based on this fruit. According to some health advocates, drinking lemon water on an empty stomach takes you one step closer to optimal health.But does swapping your morning coffee for this fashionably healthy lifestyle choice offer any significant benefit? Or is this just another health fad? Let's take a closer look at ten incredible reasons why you should start your day with a glass of lemon water. 1. Nutrient powerhouse While low in calories, lemons are loaded with health-promoting essential nutrients, including vitamin C, B-complex vitamins, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. 2. Boosts immune system Vitamin C plays a major role in our immune system, and lemons are loaded with it. A strong and healthy immune system will help you keep bacterial and viral infections at bay. 3. Digestion aid The citric acid in lemon interacts with enzymes and acids involved in digestion. It stimulates digestion and the secretion of gastric juice. Furthermore, lemon juice loosens toxins in the digestive tract and may help relieve symptoms of indigestion such as bloating, burping, and heartburn. 4. Detoxifies your body Every day, we are subjected to a wide variety of chemicals and toxins present in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. While our body has its own cleansing systems, it is a good idea to put less stress on your already overworked body and give these cleansing mechanisms a boost. Lemon juice stimulates the liver by enhancing its enzyme function, thus helping your body to flush out more waste materials and toxins . 5. Boosts heart and brain health Thanks to its high level of potassium, lemon juice aids in the proper functioning of the nervous system. Furthermore, it has been shown to lower blood pressure which is a major risk factor for a heart attack. 6. Promotes glowing skin Lemons are packed with antioxidants. These little free radical fighting substances help to decrease blemishes and wrinkles for a rejuvenated, radiant skin. When applied to the skin, lemons can also reduce the appearance of scar tissue and age spots. 7. Weight loss aid While lemon juice might not be a weight loss miracle on its own, its high levels of pectin fibers curb the appetite and will help you to eat less at main meals. 8. Fights inflammation Lemon water possesses strong anti-inflammatory properties to soothe a sore throat or inflamed tonsils. Additionally, it removes uric acid from the joints, which is one of the main contributors to chronic pain and inflammation. 9. Boosts energy levels Lemons energize the body and fight feelings of depression and anxiety. So instead of having a coffee in the morning why not try a glass of lemon juice instead? 10. Hydrates your body After a night of hard work, your body is dehydrated and in desperate need of water. Lemon juice provides your body with the much-needed water and electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) to rehydrate body tissue and flush out more toxins and waste materials.While lemon water seems to be the perfect drink to prevent or cure a myriad of our daily aches and pains, not all that glitters is gold. Lemon juice can be hard on teeth enamel. Therefore, it's important to dilute it with water and rinse your mouth thoroughly with filtered water after drinking lemon juice.

Hi David, 
We have been told, and we are preparing to report, that the FBI has taken possession of the thumb drive that was once in your possession. This is what we have been informed, and we wanted to see whether there was any sort of comment that could be provided. If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well . But we have solid reason to believe this. We‚Äôd welcome any comment you can offer. Thanks very much. 
Eric Associated Press reporter says he knows it‚Äôs true, but will gladly print that it‚Äôs false 
What‚Äôs truly astonishing in this email is how AP reporter Eric Tucker says he will gladly LIE to cover for the Clintons . In plain English, he explains that he has ‚Äúsolid reason‚Äù to believe the report about the thumb drive, but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the Associated Press , and he even suggests what that false narrative should be: ‚ÄúIf you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well.‚Äù 
In other words, he‚Äôs not just corrupt, dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist, he‚Äôs also SUGGESTING the false narrative the Clintons should use! 
This is the exact same way the AP talks to the CDC about vaccines and measles, by the way. Essentially, the Associated Press reporters say, ‚ÄúWe are total media whores, we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think we‚Äôre a credible news organization.‚Äù 
You gotta love Eric Tucker for this. The guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what we‚Äôve known for years: the AP is a total joke when it comes to real journalism . Note carefully that the AP won‚Äôt even fire Tucker for this admission. He‚Äôll probably get a prize of some sort. How many other Associated Presstitutes have deliberately LIED to cover up Clinton crimes? 
It all brings to mind the obvious question: How many other Associated Presstitutes deliberately lied to cover up Clinton crimes? 
Just what percentage of AP stories about the Clinton scandals are actually FAKE NEWS pretending to be credible journalism? (Answer: Probably about 99%.) 
It‚Äôs not just AP, either. It‚Äôs the same story at every other mainstream news organization across America: They‚Äôre all liars and crooks, and they‚Äôre all working for Hillary Clinton, the serial killer and rape excuser.

The content of the banned video? Criticism of censorship; hopefully the irony of their choice to remove it isn‚Äôt lost on YouTube‚Äôs executives. The video, titled The Dark Art of Political Intimidation, was released last week and features Kimberly Strassel. Strassel is a Wall Street Journal columnist who explains tactics commonly used by the leftists to shut down free speech from the right. This included blackmail, harassment and intimidation. Back in 2010, the IRS started to target conservative non-profit organizations intentionally. Groups were experiencing heavy delays when trying to aquire tax exempt non-profit status. This was an attempt to curb their political involvement in the 2012 election, explained Strassel. A Democratic prosecutor in Wisconsin launched a shadow campaign of financial investigation against conservatives. Their houses were raided before sunrise, with accompanying gag orders to keep them quiet about the raids. The reason for all that was revenge for supporting the Republican Governor Scott Walker. Kimberly Strassel highlights even more examples in the five-minute video showing censorship of political opponents. Youtube placed the video into restricted mode ‚Äî which is a common filter used by schools, libraries and parents to shield their children from outrageously obscene and graphic content. NewsBusters reports: ‚ÄúConservative radio host Dennis Prager‚Äôs idea for PragerU is to give students alternative, non-progressive takes on history, civics and other issues. there‚Äôs no cursing, no violence or any kind of indecency in any of them.‚Äù Prager University‚Äôs videos including those that have been censored are all G rated. This leaves questions about why the popular video platform is placing restrictions on them. At least 21 additional videos produced by the conservative not for profit educational organization that is Prager University have been placed into restricted mode by Youtube. There is a petition circulating to stop the censorship, which has aquired over 76,000 signatures so far. Hopefully, YouTube will get its act together about restricting videos that pose no threat to children. Better yet, they should make some key changes to their algorithms to prevent this from happening in the future. A Youtube statement given to Wall Street Journal stated, ‚Äú[V]ideo restrictions are decided by an ‚Äòalgorithm‚Äô that factors in ‚Äòcommunity flagging‚Äô and ‚Äòsensitive content.‚Äô‚Äù Basically progressives tripped the algorithm in an attempt to limit free speech and political involvement from conservatives. YouTube has lifted the restriction on The Dark Art of Political Intimidation this past weekend, thanks to the Wall Street Journal giving them a very hard time over the censorship.

The New World Order might seem a bit far-fetched for many. A handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age. The thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists. There is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist. That belief has been re-iterated many times, mostly from the mainstream media. There are people who see the world for what they are told it is, others see what‚Äôs really going on behind the curtain. The stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful. They either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives. 
Global mega-corporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis. A select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money, while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat. If humans stay busy working 40 weekly hours for very little income, they won‚Äôt have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand. The top 1 percent doesn‚Äôt want Americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business‚Äô. 
The global elite have a system in place which allows them to grow their global banking empire. All of humanity are literally slaves to the economic system. Money is necessary for our survival in the real world today. Most people will spend the majority of their time working just to survive in the system. If money is the god of our time, that makes Rothschild his prophet. Public School programs worldwide are where the global elite first begin to shape our minds. They continue the shaping through the media. We are taught what they want us to know and nothing more. 
The rich continue to get richer by purchasing up many successful smaller businesses. When the top 1 percent owns the majority of banks, resources and even our governments, it means big problems for the people. The Rothschilds‚Äô are worth over $500 trillion and they are just 1 of 13 families that pretty much collectively own the world. The Rothschilds‚Äô alone could pay off the US national debt 26 times over. Unfortunately they would never do such a thing because they own the majority of the world‚Äôs central banks. The New World Order‚Äôs agenda is slowly taking small steps toward complete and definitive enslavement through use of the monetary system and ownership of resources.

The New York Times publisher and executive editor have promised to rededicate the paper to its fundamental mission ‚Äî to report America and the world honestly, without favors and fear. The paper claims they will strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in stories brought to the public. This announcement is almost considered an apology to its readers for providing a year and a half of unbalanced and unhinged coverage of the presidential race. 
Sean Hannity suggests that Trump must ignore the media and trust his gut instincts. He was sad to see the 165-year-old paper destroy their credibility over the election season. It was obvious to dedicated readers that the Times had abandoned its old coverage standards. Stories were unrelentingly hostile towards Trump and his supporters. Reporters were including their personal opinions and political analysis in the news coverage. This allowed animosity toward Trump to be spread all over social media by political reporters. Front page stories on The New York Times were accusing Trump of lying, but the paper never published the same findings in reference to Hillary Clinton . The paper‚Äôs liberal readership has even gotten tired of reporting that resembles state controlled propaganda of totalitarian regimes. Newt Gingrich destroys the New York Times credibility with seven simple questions. 
The New York Times has struggled mightily to answer some serious questions posed by the former United States House of Representatives speaker. Gingrich, a Republican, has asked the times whether they have any reporters, editors or columnists that will say they voted for Trump. He elaborated to ask if they have since hired any Trump supporters to work those positions for the Times. The paper struggled to say whether or not it has hired any Republican reporters at all. 
Gingrich has also asked if the New York Times has changed its policies allowing journalists to express their opinions about events and people they are covering. The fourth question asked by Gingrich wondered if the Times reporters would surrender any Pulitzer Prizes awarded for news stories containing personal opinions. Here are the final questions that the Times struggled to address. ‚ÄúHave its editors retracted misleading news headlines that expressed opinions ‚Äî such as the paper‚Äôs coverage of Trump‚Äôs tax returns?‚Äù ‚ÄúHas it fired reporters who admitted to writing politically motivated ‚Äònews‚Äô stories and encouraged interview subjects to talk to them so they could stop Trump?‚Äù ‚ÄúHas it retracted its shameful election-eve front-page story ‚Äòreporting‚Äô on Trump‚Äôs innermost thoughts and feelings, virtually every sentence of which is filled with reporters‚Äô opinions and speculations‚Äìfeaturing claims like ‚Äòhe is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention‚Äù

I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I‚Äôve been doing this for weeks straight.

Trump can‚Äôt defend why he is wasting precious time promoting his business interests instead of campaigning. Trump doesn‚Äôt have a single campaign event scheduled until 7 PM. He has given up a critical day of campaign time to get publicity for his new hotel. 
When Trump got called out for some very unpresidential scheduling priorities, his response was to attack the reporter. 
The Republican nominee is not behaving like a person who is willing to give everything to be elected the next president, and every time he leaves his Fox News bubble, Donald Trump opens his mouth and reminds voters of why he should never be elected president.

Hillary Clinton could probably spend 24 hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting Trump‚Äôs hypocrisies. 
While Trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new DC hotel, Hillary Clinton was winning more early votes in the state of Florida. There are two competing messages in the media currently about the election. The first message is that Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting. The second message is that a few state polls have shown Trump leading by a little in Florida and gaining ground in New Hampshire. 
It is possible that both of these stories are correct. Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting, and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news, some Republicans may be coming back to Trump. 
The important thing for Hillary Clinton and Democrats is not to let up. Democrats are very close to generation defining win, but victory is not sealed yet. More polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend, but the polls may not matter. 
If most of the ballots in states like North Carolina and Florida are cast before election day, the polls may end up meaning very little. 
Hillary Clinton is in a great position, but judging from her own remarks, she is still working hard to close the deal on November 8.

The AP-GfK Poll has Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 14 points nationally 51%-37%, ‚ÄúThe AP-GfK poll finds that Clinton has secured the support of 90 percent of likely Democratic voters, and also has the backing of 15 percent of more moderate Republicans.

Earlier in the day, two Bloomberg polls that had Trump leading Florida by 2 points, and cutting Clinton‚Äôs New Hampshire lead in half gave Republicans a bit of hope that the presidential election might be tightening, but the reality is that voting is already underway in 37 states. There are very few undecided voters remaining. 
Outside of tracking polls, Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt had a polling lead since July . Besides his brief July bump, Trump hasn‚Äôt led Clinton in national polling since May. What the media and Republicans don‚Äôt want to tell you is that this presidential election has been remarkably consistent. 
There is nothing in the polling to suggest that the election is tightening, or that Trump has significantly improved his odds of winning.

Hopefully, as a country, we‚Äôll return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare. But this year, when the man at the top of the Republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses, isn‚Äôt likely to be that time. 
On Wednesday, former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh, a right-wing extremist who now hosts a talk radio show, followed his nominee‚Äôs lead and told urged his Twitter followers to grab their guns on Nov. 9 if Hillary Clinton is elected. 
Tweet: On November 8th, I‚Äôm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I‚Äôm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
‚Äî Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
This type of language from someone who used to be ‚Äì and thankfully no longer is ‚Äì a member of the United States Congress is abhorrent, but it‚Äôs also to be expected in the Trump era of American politics. 
After all, not long ago Trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if Clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate Supreme Court judges. 
‚ÄúIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,‚Äù the Republican nominee said. ‚ÄúAlthough the Second Amendment people ‚Äî maybe there is, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù 
More recently, Trump said that he‚Äôd like to see what happens if Clinton‚Äôs bodyguards were disarmed. 
‚ÄúI think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTake their guns away, let‚Äôs see what happens to her.‚Äù 
Not only does Walsh‚Äôs rhetoric align perfectly with what Trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign, but it‚Äôs also a continuation of dangerous language that the former Republican congressman seems to enjoy using. 
Earlier in the year, when five police officers were gunned down in Dallas, Walsh blamed President Obama, tweeting: ‚ÄúThis is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you.‚Äù 
Before Trump hit the scene, this type of rhetoric existed, but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party. Now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee. 
On Nov. 9, we shouldn‚Äôt hope that people take up arms to protest the results of the election. We should hope that when Trump loses, he‚Äôll take a lot of this dangerous rhetoric with him.";english;2016-10-27T02:47:11.477+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Former GOP Congressman Goes Full Trump, Encourages Armed Revolt If Clinton Wins;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-26-at-7.29.25-PM.png;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Since Republicans have essentially conceded that Donald Trump is going to lose the general election to Hillary Clinton, they‚Äôre already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate Supreme Court justices. 
According to a report from the Huffington Post on Wednesday, one conservative thinker says that John McCain‚Äôs recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by Clinton isn‚Äôt that farfetched. 
The report: 
Some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to McCain‚Äôs controversial suggestion last week that Senate Republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all Supreme Court nominees put forth by a future President Hillary Clinton. 
Who needs a fully functioning Supreme Court after all? 
‚ÄúAs a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally,‚Äù wrote the Cato Institute‚Äôs Ilya Shapiro in a column Wednesday on The Federalist. 
Shapiro is well-versed in constitutional issues, and his argument has a legal, if contorted, basis. Nothing in the Constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nation‚Äôs highest court ‚Äï if not an entire branch of the federal government ‚Äï to stop Clinton from selecting judges who share her views. 
‚Ä¶ 
To Shapiro, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with even more Senate obstructionism because ‚Äúthe Constitution is completely silent‚Äù on how the upper chamber provides its ‚Äúadvice and consent‚Äù on the president‚Äôs nominees. 
‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúSo when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senate‚Äôs constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names,‚Äù he concluded. 
The original argument from Republicans was that they would block President Obama‚Äôs Supreme Court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the Nov. 8 election. Forget the fact that this isn‚Äôt how the constitutional system is meant to operate, but that was their reasoning. 
Now, faced with the growing prospect that Hillary Clinton will be elected the 45th President of the United States, they are beginning to change their tune. 
The obstruction that defined the Republican Party throughout Obama‚Äôs presidency looks like it will be sticking around after he is gone. It‚Äôs yet another reason why down-ballot races are more critical than ever this year.";english;2016-10-27T03:48:56.617+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Conservatives Already Plotting To Block Clinton‚Äôs SCOTUS Picks, Let Court ‚ÄòDie Out‚Äô;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Capitol-Senate-1.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Ever since Donald Trump was lambasted by leaders in both parties for fighting with a Gold Star family and dishonoring the service of Captain Humayun Khan, he‚Äôs been trying out a new approach: pretending Khan would still be alive if he was president. 
Khan was killed in 2004 in a suicide attack in Iraq. 
When the Republican was asked in an interview with ABC‚Äôs George Stephanopoulos if he thinks he should apologize for the way he treated the Khan family following the Democratic National Convention, he repeated this bogus claim.

Trump said, ‚ÄúI have great respect for the Khan family, I have great respect for ‚Äì I mean their son is a great hero ‚Äì but if I were president at that time, Capt. Khan would be alive today, George, because I wouldn‚Äôt have been in Iraq ‚Ä¶ I was opposed to the war in Iraq.‚Äù 
As Hillary Clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign, Donald Trump was not opposed to the war in Iraq from the beginning. Had he been president at the time, the war still would have taken place because Trump was in favor of it. 
In fact, Trump‚Äôs campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies. This would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that America gets mired in more conflicts, not less. 
For their part, the Clinton campaign has continued to stand up to Trump‚Äôs attacks on the Khan family. In an emotional new ad released days ago, Capt. Khan‚Äôs father recounts how his son died protecting ‚Äúeveryone in his unit.‚Äù Khan‚Äôs father asked of Trump, ‚ÄúWould my son have a place in your America?‚Äù 
The answer to Mr. Khan‚Äôs question is a resounding ‚Äúno,‚Äù as Trump has promised to ban Muslims ‚Äì like the Khans ‚Äì from even entering the United States. For those living here already, a President Trump would treat them like criminals. 
Donald Trump will likely continue to rewrite history when it comes to his initial support of military intervention in Iraq.

The Republican Party, which has completely abandoned the idea of winning elections based on ideas, is firmly standing behind their nominee because the same party that was too weak to stop Trump during the primary is certainly not going to stand in the way of what might be their only chance of winning. 
People should not be afraid to go to the polls and vote. No matter who you are voting for, Democrats have your back. The Republican Party has been trying to suppress the vote and intimidate voters for years.

So Donald Trump has responded to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs accusation that he used undocumented workers to build his new D.C. hotel, a 263-room luxury hotel just blocks from the White House. Trump claims he used no undocumented workers ‚Äì and as we saw earlier , oh yeah, Hillary Clinton sleeps three days at a time. 
Trump‚Äôs decision to attend the grand opening rather than campaign raised many eyebrows, not just in the Clinton camp. Republican strategist Steve Schmidt told MSNBC, 
‚ÄúHe is not doing any of the normal activities that you‚Äôd be doing 13 days out in a presidential race for somebody who‚Äôs competitive. You don‚Äôt take a time-out to tend to your business interests.‚Äù 
As Libby Nelson wrote at Vox , ‚ÄúClinton is making her closing argument. Trump is making infomercials.‚Äù 
All this seems to have stung the thin-skinned Trump, who previously set aside his campaign to open a golf course in Scotland. As CBS News‚Äô Sopan Deb tweets , Trump‚Äôs defense was a little odd, to say the least: Trump's riff on his hotel is worth your time to read. Denies ever using undocumented immigrants and says Clinton sleeps for 3 days at a time pic.twitter.com/Rlsbebzk2Y 
‚Äî Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 27, 2016 
The Republican nominee protested to CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash , ‚ÄúFor you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop, and then she goes home and sleeps.‚Äù It is literally impossible for Trump to hear criticism without responding by attacking somebody else. 
Trump‚Äôs defense reveals a man who is overly sensitive to criticism: he ‚Äúworks all the time‚Äù while Clinton sleeps ‚Äúfor three days.‚Äù He says he took ‚Äúan hour off‚Äù (it was a bit more than that) to open his new hotel while ‚Äúshe wants to sleep all the time.‚Äù 
He says Clinton gives one speech and then sleeps for three days. In fact, Clinton made two ‚ÄúGet Out the Vote‚Äù stops in Florida yesterday; she makes an appearance with the president and first lady today in North Carolina and has two appearances scheduled in Iowa for the day after. 
And Trump‚Äôs heated denial of using undocumented workers is unconvincing, considering his track record in that regard. 
It is a fact, as Hillary Clinton said yesterday, that Donald Trump ‚Äúonce again‚Äù used undocumented labor to build a hotel. He used undocumented labor to build Trump Tower . And The Washington Post reports that ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs new downtown D.C. hotel was built thanks to the efforts of a large workforce that included Hispanic construction workers, including some workers who say they are undocumented .‚Äù Said one worker in 2015, ‚ÄúThe majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally.‚Äù 
The old saw about the man who protests too much comes to mind, in reading Trump‚Äôs denial. This is a man who has a history of exploiting undocumented immigrants and according to the workers themselves, this remains true. 
Nonsensical talk about his opponent sleeping for three days straight is pure deflection, and it won‚Äôt work. Trump already has his clothing lines made in China, Mexico, and elsewhere, and he has used undocumented labor even while railing against the loss of American jobs. 
Trump is a hypocrite, and hissy fits and deflection are no answer to the allegations against him, and certainly no recommendation for the office of president.";english;2016-10-27T15:01:20.223+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Stung By Clinton Allegations, Trump Claims He Used No Undocumented Workers in DC Hotel;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/trump-angry.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
Over the past few months, there has been a dearth of good news, and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical American election. Where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change. Even dismissing the horrible flooding, wildfires, droughts, sea level rise, melting ice caps, hurricanes and worldwide food shortages, there have only been dire reports on the level of CO2 permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly record-setting rise in global temperatures. 
This week, while most Americans were living, breathing and bleeding over Donald Trump and the tortuously-long presidential campaign, the International Energy Agency offered up some good news; for the climate, the Earth‚Äôs population, and even for America. 
The good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on Tuesday by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that stated according to new data, for the first time ‚ÄúRenewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world.‚Äù 
It may not seem like such fantastic news, but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climate-ending 2-degree C rise in global temperatures, it is critical for the world to transition off of carbon-producing fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy generating sources. This is particularly true for getting off dirty coal-fired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of America‚Äôs C02 emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming. 
The IEA report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly two-thirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in, and coming from, developing and industrialized nations alike. For a developing nation, it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuel-generated power sources whether they are dirty coal-fired plants or not-quite-as-dirty natural gas-burning generating plants. 
The IEA also revised its earlier projections for renewable energy‚Äôs continued expansion and growth and ‚Äú significantly increased‚Äù the amount of ‚Äú green energy ‚Äù it expects to ‚Äú come on line ‚Äù over the next five years. Renewable energy includes so-called ‚Äúgreen‚Äù sources such as biomass, biogas, eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Both terms, ‚Äúrenewable and green energy,‚Äù include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable. 
In addition to pro-renewable policies (such as the Paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the America-China deal to roll back coal-generated emissions, there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables; particularly in solar. And, the IEA projected that the worldwide costs for solar-generated power will continue declining by an additional 25 percent over the next five years. Onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another 15 percent during that same five-year period. 
Although the IEA report was incredibly good news for the entire planet, there was some extra good news in the report about America‚Äôs transition to renewable energy. According to the IEA‚Äôs Medium-Term Renewable Market Report, the United States is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing. What that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the ever-increasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity. Still, America has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of America‚Äôs electricity. 
In time and if the Koch brothers allow it, America may catch up to still-developing nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources. Industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy. 
Although there appears to be no down-side in this bit of good news, the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications. The dirty coal industry is facing some struggles‚Ääin part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices, financial mismanagement, and new clean-air regulations, but the amount of CO2 driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity. It is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs. 
The IEA couldn‚Äôt pass up the chance to note one ‚Äústicking point‚Äù in their otherwise encouraging report; ‚Äú persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy ‚Äù that renewables are not affecting. However, since the IEA only monitored and tracked the world‚Äôs transistor from oil and gas to biofuels, they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world, they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener, significantly cheaper, and one Hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people. 
It is a mystery how Republicans beholden to the Koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry, particularly the dirty coal industry, will absorb this good news. In the past eight years, Republicans , the Kochs, their lobbyists at the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals. It is likely that the IEA‚Äôs report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome. But now that more Americans are benefitting from renewable energy, particularly solar, Republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the Sun and saving the climate for their children‚Äôs future; something the IEA‚Äôs report never mentions.

To compensate for this, Trump‚Äôs campaign has devised another strategy, which, not surprisingly, is negative. Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. ‚ÄúWe have three major voter suppression operations under way,‚Äù says a senior official. They‚Äôre aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. Trump‚Äôs invocation at the debate of Clinton‚Äôs WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. And her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are ‚Äúsuper predators‚Äù is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls‚Äîparticularly in Florida. 
The effort was obvious, and according to the polling, it is failing. 
Voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest Harvard IOP young voters poll. Sanders started flocking towards Clinton in August , and haven‚Äôt left, and early voting statistics show that African-American turnout is solid in swing states. 
The Trump campaign has realized that they don‚Äôt have enough supporters to win, so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states. 
However, for voter suppression efforts like Trump‚Äôs to be effective, the campaign must have a credible messenger. Donald Trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter, and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message. 
A voter suppression effort was expected from the Trump campaign. What is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it. 
People on all sides of the political spectrum who care about basic democratic institutions should be alarmed by Trump‚Äôs public attack on democracy.

Rep. Paul Ryan could be out of a job after the election, as divided House Republicans are already plotting to fire their Speaker if Trump‚Äôs defeat triggers a big enough loss of House seats. 
If Democrats pick up 15 House seats or more, Speaker Ryan is going to have a major problem because his job will be in jeopardy. Politico reported that Ryan‚Äôs enemies in the House Freedom Caucus are divided over whether or not to support him. 
Conservative House Republicans are plotting with one another and openly pining for Ryan‚Äôs ouster because he refuses to change the House rules to all more conservative legislation to be passed. The Hill is also reporting that conservativeHouse Republicans are deeply divided on keeping Ryan, but Donald Trump could be the wild card that mobilizing an opposition effort to the Speaker, ‚ÄúThe businessman has repeatedly criticized Ryan‚Äôs leadership and was stung after the Speaker said he would not longer defend Trump after a 2005 tape emerged in which the GOP nominee speaks lewdly about groping and kissing women.

Ryan is certain to be leading a smaller House majority in January. The size of Trump‚Äôs defeat on election day will help decide how many seats Republicans lose.

In a story that sounds very familiar, former Miss Finland Ninni Laaksonen told the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat that the now Republican nominee grabbed her butt just before Trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the Late Show with David Letterman in 2006. 
‚ÄúBefore the show we were photographed outside the building,‚Äù Laaksonen is quoted by Haaretz . ‚ÄúTrump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I don‚Äôt think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought, ‚ÄòWhat is happening?'‚Äù 
As to the veracity of these claims, it should be noted that Laaksonen didn‚Äôt seek the tabloid out. Ilta-Sanomat, the second largest paper in the country according to Wikipedia , reached out to Finnish women who had encountered Trump and that‚Äôs how they discovered her story. 
In case you‚Äôre not already grimacing, the former Miss Finland added, ‚ÄúSomebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger.‚Äù 
Trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of 35. Melania Trump is now 46, so she would have been ‚Äúexpired‚Äù when this alleged groping incident took place in 2006. 
New York Magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against Donald Trump. 
Donald Trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their ‚Äúp*ssy‚Äù against their will, so it‚Äôs not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the Trump machine. 
What should be alarming is that Donald Trump is the best of the best on the Republican bench. I mean, that is supposed to be how this works, right? A group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it. 
Republicans try to say this is just locker room talk, but if then Senator Barack Obama had had a bus tape like Trump‚Äôs, let alone 12 women accusing him of doing what he bragged about doing, he not only wouldn‚Äôt be in office right now ‚Äì he wouldn‚Äôt have been a contender.

Mrs. Obama went on to call Trump‚Äôs vision of America grounded in hopelessness and despair. She said Trump calls on us to build walls and to be afraid. 
The First Lady said that voters have a choice between those who divide the country between us and them and those who encourage us to embrace our better angels. 
First Lady Obama said that the election is about who will shape our children and the country we leave for them. 
Obama devasted Trump by reminding America that the president is the most powerful role model for children in the world.

Contrary to some Republican hopes, Donald Trump‚Äôs slide has not stopped. Trump continues to lose support with men in Iowa and Georgia. North Carolina appears to be slipping away from Trump, and the Republican nominee has blown his leads in Iowa and Georgia. 
The Trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose Florida, they will lose the election, but the signs are evident in the polling that the Republican Party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the White House in November. 
A Trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for Republicans that leads to additional Democratic Senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority. Republicans could see their current record House majority gutted in a Clinton landslide.

Donald Trump is hemorrhaging Evangelical women voters. Their support for him stood at 58 percent in mid-October. Barely above half. Romney had 77 percent in 2012. As noted here yesterday , Romney had a lot of support Trump lacks. And Romney lost. 
There have been rumblings among prominent Evangelical women, like Beth Moore of Living Proof Ministries: Try to absorb how acceptable the disesteem and objectifying of women has been when some Christian leaders don't think it's that big a deal. 
‚Äî Beth Moore (@BethMooreLPM) October 9, 2016 
Politico asked earlier this month how long Evangelical women can remain behind Trump. 
That answer is in, according to the Wall Street Journal , which says they are turning away, that the ‚ÄúRepublican nominee faces vocal backlash from evangelical women over lewd comments and sexual-misconduct allegations.‚Äù

Kimberly Ross wrote at Red State earlier this month that, 
I don‚Äôt believe that I, as an American woman, am oppressed. However, it is beyond disappointing that men who not only claim faith, but are in leadership roles, are so willing to dismiss a predator among them. Maybe Trump has promised them some future role? I don‚Äôt know. Regardless, they are lured away from doing their duty and instead join in with someone whose hobby is casting females aside. I‚Äôm disgusted by Trump and his male cheerleaders. You should be, too. Thankfully, women like Beth Moore and Rev. Lisa Sharon Harper won‚Äôt stay quiet on the sidelines as some Evangelical men have always wished they would. 
She is hardly alone, and more and more Evangelical women are joining the ranks of those who have heard enough misogyny from Trump. The reaction of Evangelical women, as Laurie Goodstein noted at The New York Times earlier this month, be a rift ‚Äúthat shapes politics for years.‚Äù 
It isn‚Äôt as if Trump hasn‚Äôt been saying these things all along. As David French protested at the National Review back in June, Trump ‚Äúsubverts all of our most cherished values.‚Äù The question is, what took them so long? 
Trump has already had an effect on the Religious Right, an unrepentant sinner who represents everything they claim to oppose. He has 70 percent support from Evangelical men, but while Evangelical women seem to support him despite his misogyny, there are good reasons to suspect the men support him because of his negative attitude towards women.

In an interview with Bill O‚ÄôReilly on Thursday, Donald Trump was again asked about the ‚ÄòAccess Hollywood‚Äô tape in which the Republican nominee was caught bragging about sexually assaulting women. This time, though, he put up a new defense strategy, at least when it comes to this particular issue ‚Äì blame the microphone. 
When asked by O‚ÄôReilly if he thinks he would be winning the election if not for the release of the video, Trump once again repeated that it was only ‚Äúlocker room talk,‚Äù and then started complaining that a microphone shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to capture his comments. 
Shockingly, he did not express any regrets for his language.

‚ÄúIt was locker room talk. The microphone was not supposed to be on ‚Ä¶ it was an illegal act that was NBC. It was not supposed to be on‚Ä¶ that was a private dressing room.‚Äù 
It‚Äôs amazing how often a microphone can be the root of a presidential candidate‚Äôs troubles. 
It should also be noted that Trump‚Äôs complaint about his dressing room privacy being breached is particularly rich given his history of storming into the dressing rooms of teenage pageant contestants, some as young as 15 years old. 
When asked by O‚ÄôReilly if he would take legal action against NBC‚Äôs role in uncovering and releasing the tape, Trump said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see.‚Äù 
All of this comes after Trump recently promised to sue the growing number of women who have come forward saying that they were sexually assaulted by him. 
Trump also spent an absurd amount of time in the interview complaining that the media is rigged (not true), voter fraud is widespread (false), and the polls are dirty (they‚Äôre not).

Overall, the Democratic nominee is beating Trump by an average of 5.4 points with just 12 days to go ‚Äì and as millions of Americans have already cast their ballots. 
On the Electoral College front, RealClearPolitics shows that Clinton is ahead in states that total 333 electoral votes. One of the states she leads in is Arizona ‚Äì a red state before Republicans nominated Trump. 
To put things in perspective, Barack Obama was leading Mitt Romney by just a single percentage point on this day in 2012. That is what you call a close presidential contest, and Obama still went on to easily win. 
Yet, as I write, CNN and other cable news networks continue to plaster the ‚Äúclose race‚Äù chyron all over their networks, claiming Donald Trump is making it a race again.

Probably not. There are always others to blame and Trump‚Äôs list of those plotting against him grows in inverse proportion to his polling numbers.

Unsurprisingly, they are behind on polling, leading in precisely ZERO (0) polls . You want to win an election? You need sweet hats"" -Abraham Lincoln

And now Clinton has four times the cash. 
And The Washington Post is reporting that in the first 19 days of October, Trump only raised half as much as Clinton according to campaign finance reports. His biggest day was the $11.5 million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released, which tells you all you need to know about his base. 
Remember when Trump claimed he would give $100m of his own money to his campaign? Yeah, this is a guy who won‚Äôt even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia. He uses other peoples‚Äô money for that. With the election just 10 days away, he has only donated $56m. 
Make what you will of this, but he had been giving $2m a month to his campaign. In the first 19 days of October? Just $31k in in-kind contributions. That‚Äôs right: even Trump won‚Äôt invest in his own campaign at this point. 
Trump pulled in $61m up to October 19, down from $100m in September. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign has pulled in a cool $101m in that same period. She spent less than normal, $54m, but that leaves her a war chest of $153m going into the final stretch. 
Donald Trump says he is a great businessman, yet he has spent twice as much on collateral (including hats) as he has on paying his staff. He says he gets only the best people. And he bought a lot of his #MAGA hats. His campaign site only sells 18 different styles of hat at $20 to $30 apiece. 
And according to Huffington Post , The October 15 Federal Election Commission filing for Trump Make America Great Again Committee shows Trump spent $300k of donors money to buy his own book ‚Äì presumably The Art of the Deal. He profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments, and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the $22 book at $184 each. 
His campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters, yet Trump told a crowd in Geneva, Ohio that ‚ÄúHillary Clinton has never earned an honest dollar, well I think that‚Äôs really, you know‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the White House while turning a personal profit. 
Now it looks as though Trump has seen a point of diminishing returns. He not only did not self-fund his campaign as promised, he has barely spent half of what he said he would spend, down to almost nothing at all as defeat looms and the potential for profit evaporates.

It is a cruel reality of American electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse, and that process has already begun for Donald Trump. 
Despite the fact that Trump has been claiming that the presidential election is going to be rigged, stolen, or unfair, his cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears. The latest Washington Post tracking poll found that confidence that votes will be counted correctly grew by 12 points from 31%-43%. The number of respondents who believed that voter fraud occurs somewhat often has dropped from 47%-37%, and those expressing concerns that all votes will be counted accurately dropped from 34% to 28%. Even Trump supporters are split 50%-49% on whether or not votes will be counted accurately. 
Part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that President Obama did in addressing these concerns, but it is most likely that voters are treating Trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election. 
One of the best indicators of a presidential election‚Äôs outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win. 
Hillary Clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election, which is a hint of the way that people are voting. 
The process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the US two party system. Losing candidates who refuse to go away, like Sarah Palin, are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up. 
Trump‚Äôs fifteen minutes of fame on the national stage appear to be coming to an end. His words can still poison and damage our country at a cultural level, which is why he still needs to be discussed, but as far as changing minds and winning an election, it looks voters are in the process of banishing Trump from the political island.";english;2016-10-28T18:10:27.176+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;The Banishment Of Trump Has Begun As The American People Are Tuning Him Out;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump-rejected.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Donald Trump raised just $29 million for his presidential campaign committee in the first 19 days of October, about half as much as his Democratic rival, putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the White House contest, new campaign finance reports filed Thursday night showed. 
The GOP presidential nominee had just $16 million left in his campaign coffers on Oct. 19, compared to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs $62 million. When the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included, Clinton‚Äôs war chest grew to $153 million, while Trump‚Äôs totaled $68 million. 
Trump‚Äôs total fundraising dropped 39% in the first 19 days of October. $29 million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race. At a time when Trump needs boots on the ground to get out the Republican vote, his presidential campaign is broke, and in debt to the tune of $2 million. There isn‚Äôt going to be a last-minute ad blitz for Trump, or a reservation of television time so that the Republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day. 
The plan for Trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies, which are good for Trump‚Äôs ego, but not effective in getting voters to the polls. Trump promised to donate $100 million to his campaign but has only given $56 million . The billionaire who promised to self-finance has run his presidential campaign into the ground. Trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in October. 
Fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes. The money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election. Hillary Clinton is having no trouble raising money, which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters. Trump‚Äôs cash crush points to a depressed base that doesn‚Äôt expect him to win. 
Trump has done what he does best. He talked a big game while bankrupting the Republican Party for his own personal gain.

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
If Donald Trump wants to keep Arizona in the Republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because Hillary Clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. 
The Clinton announced that the Democratic nominee would be spending part of the last week of the campaign in Arizona, ‚ÄúOn Wednesday, November 2, ‚Äé Hillary Clinton will campaign in Phoenix, Arizona, days before Election Day. Clinton will lay out what is at stake in the election. With more people voting in this election than any in history, Clinton will urge Arizona voters to take advantage of in-person early voting. Voters can check their registration status and early vote location at iwillvote.com.‚Äù 
The fact that Clinton will be in usually reliably red Arizona in November during the final week of the presidential campaign tells voters all they need to know about the state of the presidential race. 
Hillary Clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue. 
The Trump campaign already deployed VP nominee Mike Pence to Utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling, and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving Arizona to prevent Clinton from winning a state that has been a given for Republicans in previous elections. 
The Trump campaign is broke. The nominee had to give his campaign $10 million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads. 
The Clinton campaign is trying to stretch Trump past his breaking point by making a serious play for Arizona. It is a brilliant move from a campaign that has outwitted its Republican opponent at every turn.";english;2016-10-28T20:53:16.992+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Hillary Clinton Is Brilliantly Forcing Broke Trump To Spend Money Defending Arizona;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/clinton-victory-speech.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in Florida. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by four points (48/44), and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy is tied with Republican incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, 46/46. By an almost two to-one margin, 51/26, Florida voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate for U.S. Senate who supports strengthening gun laws, suggesting ample room for growth for gun safety candidates before the election next month. 
The poll was conducted by PPP the Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, and it illustrates the dilemma that the Florida Senate race has created for Democrats. Democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive Florida media, but there are polls that suggest that Sen. Marco Rubio‚Äôs Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy, has a chance of winning the seat. 
If Rep. Murphy can beat Sen. Rubio, the defeat would likely put an end to Rubio‚Äôs national political career or at least force the Florida Republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in 2020, and instead focus on a run for governor. 
Democrats have a real chance to send Marco Rubio to the unemployment line. Rubio has been a disinterested Senator, who just like Ted Cruz, seems only interest in his Senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions. Rubio has provided poor service to his constituents , and doesn‚Äôt deserve to return to the US Senate. 
Sen. Rubio has refused to commit to serving his full Senate term, which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them. 
Democrats have a chance to solidify their potential Senate majority by sending Marco Rubio home. With cash to spend and less than two weeks left in the campaign, they‚Äôd be foolish not to take it.

Nope. Pence is offended by a news report he hasn't read about their voter suppression efforts. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs offensive to me, that kind of language. It‚Äôs not our operation,‚Äù Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Friday morning on MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe . 
Yes, Donald Trump‚Äôs Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he‚Äôs offended by, but it‚Äôs not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. 
Nope. 
Did Pence read the story? No. But he‚Äôs offended. So offended. Because that kind of language is offensive. Not the actual suppression of the votes, but the language, because it‚Äôs not ‚Äúour operation.‚Äù 
Watch here via MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe : 
Twice saying he hasn‚Äôt read the article, Pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadn‚Äôt read, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs offensive to me, that kind of language. It‚Äôs not our operation,‚Äù Pence denied. 
‚ÄúDonald Trump and I want every American who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election. And that‚Äôs our message, is to tell the American people that this country really belongs to them. That we can have government as good as our people again, but it‚Äôs going to take all of us.‚Äù 
‚ÄúAnd you saw Donald Trump ‚Ä¶ say that people who haven‚Äôt traditionally voted Republican, we‚Äôve got an agenda to bring our cities back‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Pence is twice offended, so super offended: 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way. Frankly, you know, it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because that‚Äôs just not the approach Donald Trump has taken to this campaign. It‚Äôs not the approach we‚Äôre taking. We‚Äôre reaching out to every American.‚Äù 
Pence then claimed Independents and even Democrats are breaking for Trump. In fact Trump and Pence are even losing groups that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. Pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame Republicans into voting for them by saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Republicans to come home‚Äù because Trump won the primary. 
Mike Pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done, because ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not what I see out there.‚Äù 
Trump also loves to cite what he ‚Äúsees‚Äù and reads, and often times those things turn out to not even exist ‚Äì like videos he claims to have watched. 
This explains why Mike Pence and Donald Trump ended up together. It turns out, they are not that different after all, in spite of the Republican establishment‚Äôs efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise. Both Pence and Trump don‚Äôt care a whit about facts. This is more than typical campaign spin, it‚Äôs appalling in context. 
The context is that Mike Pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a woman‚Äôs ‚Äúp*ssy‚Äù without her permission, but he is publicly saying he‚Äôs offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts. 
Pence didn‚Äôt even bother to read the article, which suggests that he doesn‚Äôt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters. But why would he? 
Pence didn‚Äôt care about any of the groups Donald Trump insulted ‚Äì not enough to take a public stand, so why start now. But he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign. 
Like Trump, Pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior.

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Donald Trump‚Äôs message that everything in the U.S. is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only Trump can fix got slapped down today as the U.S. economy ‚Äúroars back‚Äù. 
The advance estimate of GDP for the third quarter of 2016 showed that the Obama economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9%. The conservative Wall Street Journal headlined this news with, ‚ÄúU.S. Economy Roars Back, Grew 2.9% in Third Quarter.‚Äù 
Jason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, summarized the numbers, ‚ÄúReal GDP grew 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending.‚Äù 
This news flies in the face of Donald Trump‚Äôs basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix. ‚ÄúThe Trump economic plan creates at least 25 million jobs, boosts growth up to 4 percent, and is revenue neutral,‚Äù Trump‚Äôs website claims. 
Before these numbers, Trump‚Äôs previous problem was that Trump‚Äôs economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent, isn‚Äôt revenue neutral and would destroy 11 million jobs. Trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run. 
The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation found that Trump‚Äôs plan would cost the US trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by 10%-16%. Trump‚Äôs tax plan could cost the U.S. 11 million jobs. 
According to a report released at the end of July by Moody‚Äôs Analytics, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections. ‚ÄúThe analysis shows that, if implemented, the Democratic nominee‚Äôs agenda would create 10.4 million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of 2.7 percent.‚Äù 
Under Trump‚Äôs plan, Moody‚Äôs estimated that unemployment would spike to 7 percent and over 3 million Americans would be put out of work. ‚ÄúThe U.S. economy will weaken significantly if Mr. Trump‚Äôs economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed,‚Äù the June report said. ‚ÄúThe economy will suffer a recession that begins in early 2018 and extends into 2020‚Ä¶even longer than the Great Recession.‚Äù 
Yikes. 
Trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts. Trump earned a ‚ÄúPants on Fire!‚Äù from PolitiFact for this claim made June 16th, 2015 in his presidential announcement speech, ‚ÄúThe last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product ‚Ä¶ was below zero. Who ever heard of this? It‚Äôs never below zero.‚Äù 
But also they note, ‚ÄúFinally, since Trump was attacking Obama for this bad quarter of growth, we‚Äôll just throw this out: Of the 42 quarters of negative growth since World War II, 30 occurred under Republican presidents and just 12 under Democratic presidents.‚Äù 
Today‚Äôs new economic numbers help Clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under President Obama. 
Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Jacob Leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say, ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs GDP release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years‚Ä¶ But Hillary Clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Independent experts agree her plan would create good-paying jobs through investments in infrastructure, innovation and education.‚Äù 
The economy is roaring back under President Obama, and the numbers suggest that it does better under a Democratic president. Donald Trump keeps saying Clinton is 4 more years of Obama, which makes a sunny case for her. 
Trump is already struggling with just 11 days to go until the election on November 8th, and these numbers just added more weight to his uphill battle.

‚ÄúWe have a protester! By the way, were you paid $15,000 to be a thug?‚Äù Republican nominee Donald Trump yelled at a black man from his lectern during a rally Wednesday evening in Kinston, North Carolina. 
Trump went on suggesting that the man had been paid by Hillary Clinton to protest Trump. But it turns out, as usual, Trump‚Äôs paranoia got the best of him and he kicked out his own supporter, a man named C.J. Cary who happened to be wearing a GOP badge and holding a letter supporting Trump but urging him to stop being so offensive. 
Watch here via Raleigh‚Äôs News & Observer: 
The News and Observer reported, ‚ÄúCary says he wanted to deliver a note to Trump urging him to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups: black people, women, people with disabilities and college students. Cary, an African-American, says he‚Äôs an ex-Marine who also worked in Afghanistan as a civilian for the U.S. Army.‚Äù 
The irony is no doubt lost on the Trump crowd that this man came to urge Trump to be more inclusive of African Americans and he got called a paid thug and kicked out. So the answer to his plea seems to be, ‚ÄúNever gonna happen.‚Äù 
Cary was wearing a GOP badge and his letter slammed Hillary Clinton and President Obama. 
Leave it to Donald to shrink his own tent even more. It wasn‚Äôt enough that he tossed out a baby, now he‚Äôs going after his few minority supporters.

Hillary Clinton did a quick presser in Iowa to respond to questions about the FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs decision to appear to violate the Hatch Act 11 by participating in political activities 11 days before an election.

‚ÄúThe American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately. The director himself has said he doesn‚Äôt know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not,‚Äù the Democratic nominee said. 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs incumbent on the FBI to tell us what they‚Äôre talking about,‚Äù Clinton said. 
Clinton pushed for more information to be released ‚Äúwithout delay.‚Äù She said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasn‚Äôt given advance notice. Clinton said she had not been contacted by Comey on this issue. 
When asked what she would tell voters about her emails, Clinton responded, ‚ÄúI think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails.‚Äù 
This might be the right place to mention the 22 million emails the Bush administration ‚Äúlost‚Äù and the private RNC servers they used, as context for how important this issue really is to Republicans as a value.

The Republican FBI Director James Comey wrote the House on Friday to inform hopeful Republicans that they had found new emails relating to Clinton‚Äôs private email that begged further investigation. 
It turns out the emails didn‚Äôt come from Clinton‚Äôs server and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any there there, except for giving Republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote. 
Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act, and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against Comey . 
Hillary Clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point. How many years on is this? Republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long it‚Äôs DOA. The press has followed Republicans‚Äô lead with the absurd email story- a story as ridiculous as it is common, and a story that was never a story until Clinton did it. 
Republicans and some in the press think this might sink the Clinton campaign. So they think America would rather put Putin‚Äôs puppet who laughs about sexually assaulting women in the White House than someone whose emails we‚Äôve all read now and found nothing much but gossip.

The reason why the Clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with Trump‚Äôs DOA White House bid, and everything to do with helping Republicans keep control of Congress. 
On the surface, the sudden revival of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails looks like an October surprise designed to help Republican nominee Donald Trump. The problem with this theory is that both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that Trump is toast. 
Unless Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails say, ‚ÄúLOL. I was the shooter on the grassy knoll,‚Äù there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election. In fact, the emails FBI Director was investigating did not come from Clinton or her server. They seem to have very little to do with Hillary Clinton or her presidential campaign. 
The emails are like catnip to Republican voters, who have been promised for years that if they keep sending Republicans to Congress, they‚Äôll bring down a Democratic president, and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival. 
For the next ten days, Republican Congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating Hillary Clinton. The Republican candidates can pretend like Trump doesn‚Äôt exist because their new pitch to voters is, ‚ÄúVote for me and I‚Äôll bring down Hillary.‚Äù 
Donald Trump is a lost cause. Millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states. Trump is being out organized and trounced by Clinton on the ground. 
To understand the real value of the email scandal to the Republican Party, look down the ballot.

So Donald Trump‚Äôs warnings about almost non-existent voter fraud were right after all. 
The only problem is that it was a Donald Trump supporter who committed voter fraud by voting twice. 
Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into jail Thursday on a felony charge of first-degree election misconduct after being arrested for suspicion of voting twice, according to the Des Moines Register . 
Authorities say the registered Republican cast two electoral ballots in Polk County. She was held in jail on a $5,000 bond and released Friday.

This does make it pretty awkward for Republicans, especially Trump supporters who‚Äôve been told to ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù areas where liberals and Democrats vote, which is actually called voter intimidation and is also against the law. 
In fact, Donald Trump‚Äôs unfounded claims that the election is rigged got the Republican Party sued for voter intimidation. And now one of Trump‚Äôs own supporters is arrested over voter fraud.

Former DOJ spokesman for Eric Holder Matthew Miller, a self described ‚Äúrecovering flack from DOJ, DSCC‚Äù, schooled Republican FBI Director James Comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within 60 days of an election. 
‚ÄúThe department and the FBI have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and Director Comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case,‚Äù Miller said on CNN. ‚ÄúBut this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election, and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last 60 days let alone the last 11 days.‚Äù 
Watch here: 
Miller also held school on Twitter about Comey‚Äôs abuse of power, which has led to Hillary Clinton having to defend against a negative: I wrote a piece in July on why Comey's public comments about Clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power. 1/ https://t.co/G8croz4qWZ

The problem with Comey‚Äôs actions isn‚Äôt that he is investigating Hillary Clinton; the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election. It is an established rule that ongoing investigations aren‚Äôt commented on for obvious reasons. 
This is quite simply not done. Comey‚Äôs reasons for doing this are unclear, and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense. But it‚Äôs troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rules/agreements of law surrounding the Trump campaign, which seems to have lowered the bar all around.

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Earlier this week Friday Fox Follies , under the assumption the explosive , and bizarre battle between Megyn Kelly and Newt Gingrich, would be this week‚Äôs lede , I had already tricked up an opening paragraph. In case you missed it , that‚Äôs when he got personal , accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues . This week‚Äôs column would have been about how the Fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election. The NYT calls ‚Äôem Megyn Moments ; I call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù Channel: it‚Äôs unthinking audience. 
Then came word that Rupert Murdoch was playing hardball as Kelly‚Äôs contract negotiations break out into the open. That paragraph, lovingly crafted, went out the window. But, let‚Äôs see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings, as Trump Congratulates Newt Gingrich For Getting His Butt Kicked By Megyn Kelly . Watch: 
As Kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof , Rupert Murdoch seems desperate to keep her. Her contract expires next year and Rupie opened up to the Wall Street Journal ‚Äî of which he is owner ‚Äî to partially cajole Kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract. Million in Contract Talks With Fox News 
‚ÄúIf they are going to make a network that is going to be a post-Ailes/post-Trump, it will be around Megyn Kelly, Chris Wallace and Shep Smith, and they are going to have to throw Hannity and O‚ÄôReilly overboard,‚Äù said Andrew Tyndall, a television-news consultant, of other hosts at the network. That isn‚Äôt going to happen, promised Mr. Murdoch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not changing direction‚Ä¶that would be business suicide,‚Äù he said. Mr. O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs contract is also up at the end of next year, and Mr. Murdoch said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to want Bill to stay with us.‚Äù Mr. Hannity‚Äôs contract isn‚Äôt up until 2020. Ms. Kelly has forged close ties to Mr. Murdoch‚Äôs sons, particularly Lachlan Murdoch, who is co-executive chairman of Fox and has taken an active role in contract talks, people close to the situation said. 
Fox would like to settle this before the election and before Kelly‚Äôs book is released, both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well. 
From the The Power of Megyn Kelly‚Äôs Feminism‚ÄîEven if She Doesn‚Äôt Call It That , by The Daily Beast‚Äôs Tim Teeman : 
Imagine, then, her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praise-ridden screeds out today: ‚ÄúHow Megyn Kelly Became an Improbable Feminist Icon‚Äù (Vanity Fair); ‚ÄúMegyn Kelly Has Become The Biggest Example of White Feminism At Work (Pajiba); and ‚ÄúAw Crap‚ÄîHere‚Äôs Proof That Megyn Kelly Is Kind of a Feminist Role Model Now‚Äù (The Stir). Note the grudging headlines. Because of Kelly‚Äôs employer, and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional, left-wing context throughout her career to date, the F-word mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl. This, in itself, reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of Kelly‚Äôs critics: It is perfectly possible to work for a right-facing institution and not be 100 percent right wing yourself, or spout the prevailing dogma of the TV station you work for. (Full disclosure: I worked for The Times of London, a British, Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper, for over 13 years.) 
Aside from the fact that when she tilts Right, she tends to tilt alt-right, the biggest knock on Kelly is that she‚Äôs too hard-edged. Marshall McLuhan spoke of the Medium Cool of tee vee, but Kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy . This makes her less attractive to other networks. She‚Äôs hoping to change that impression when she co-hosts Live with Kelly Ripa (The Kelly & Kelly Show?) the morning after the election . Think of her as a designated hitter, trying to knock Murdoch‚Äôs hardball right out of the park. 
STILL WATTERS STILL: A few weeks back FFF reported on a racist Watters World in which the White Privileged Pencil-Necked Geek made fun of Asians. This week Asian American groups meet with Fox News personnel over awful Jesse Watters segment : 
Paul Cheung, president of AAJA, told the Erik Wemple Blog that the meeting was ‚Äúproductive.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think they heard what the community‚Äôs reactions are,‚Äù he said of the session at New York‚Äôs Museum of Chinese in America. Approximately 130 Asian American ‚Äúgroups and allies‚Äù have signed an open letter to Fox News regarding the unfortunate episode, said Cheung. Ron Kim, a New York state assemblyman in attendance, told this blog that a representative from ‚ÄúThe O‚ÄôReilly Factor‚Äù and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting. Together they played a ‚Äúgood cop, bad cop‚Äù routine, said Kim. ‚ÄúThe gentleman from O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of Fox News and sometimes edgy humor can go too far,‚Äù said Kim. Once again, the specter of Fox News‚Äôs vaunted news-opinion divide presents itself. As we‚Äôve noted before, this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify Fox News hosts such as Sean Hannity openly campaigning for Donald Trump, Steve Doocy of the morning show ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù spreading harmful innuendo into the public square ‚Ä¶ and O‚ÄôReilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about Chinatown.";english;2016-10-29T08:03:51.744+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Friday Fox Follies ‚Äì Megyn & Murdoch‚Äôs Money;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/megyn-kelly-newt-gingrich.jpg;0;1;152;0;152;bias

So what needs to happen, special prosecutor? She can't investigate herself as the president-elect""   
President Barack Obama did not have to do anything wrong for Republicans to want to throw him in jail, or to impeach him. Hillary Clinton doesn‚Äôt have to have done anything wrong either, apparently, for Congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected ‚Äì because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her . 
At least, that and completely ignoring the facts, was the theme on Fox News last night, though to be fair, other mainstream media outlets weren‚Äôt much better yesterday. 
Megyn Kelly, fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a face-off with Newt Gingrich, suggested to Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte (R-WV) that given the FBI revelations of a complete lack of evidence that Hillary Clinton has done anything wrong, ‚Äúwhat needs to happen‚Äù is a special prosecutor. 
MEGYN KELLY : Let me ask you this. If she gets elected on November 8th, this isn‚Äôt going away. So what needs to happen, [a] special prosecutor? She can‚Äôt investigate herself as the president-elect. BOB GOODLATTE : Well, first of all, we have said from the outset that the House Judiciary Committee would follow the truth wherever it leads, and we have done that throughout the summer, asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the FBI was being conducted. We will continue to do that. We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen now. We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen after the election. So it‚Äôs pure speculation what will happen afterwards. A special prosecutor, remember, is appointed by the Attorney General of the United States. So, you have to decide whether that‚Äôs going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the FBI under the direction of Director Comey right now. And the Judiciary Committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation. 
Democracy is a fragile thing. It is to Goodlatte‚Äôs credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in 2014 and that he cautioned Megyn Kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the House but by the Attorney General. However, the GOP-led House has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy. 
What holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works. Republicans have decided it only works if they‚Äôre in charge, and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries, appoint special prosecutors if they win, or vote to impeach them outright, as Trump‚Äôs pet snake at CNN, Jeffrey Lord, called for last night : 
Two points, Anderson. One, with 11 days left, this makes Donald Trump‚Äôs argument exactly to the point here, you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment, her paranoia and all of the rest. The second thing, Anderson is, and this is the really disturbing thing, let‚Äôs just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election, this isn‚Äôt going to stop. There will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that Bible. This is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly, I mean that‚Äôs something the American people need to consider now. 
It is not difficult to see where this will lead. Hillary Clinton has committed no crimes. Far from being a miscarriage of justice, though it is that as well, this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity. 
This sort of talk is just further evidence that Donald Trump comes from the same vile brew as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and the rest of the party. During the McCarthy era, the House took it upon itself to be both judge and jury. Last night, it was Fox News egging the House on for more of the same. 
This sort of talk is deplorable, it is reprehensible, and it is dangerous ‚Äì and strikes at the very heart of our democracy.";english;2016-10-29T16:02:00.803+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Fox News Calls for Special Prosecutor to Investigate Hillary Clinton;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly-goodlatte-special-prosecutor.jpg;0;1;873;0;873;bias

In a conference call with reporters, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager said that FBI Director Comey‚Äôs letter is backfiring and energizing Clinton‚Äôs volunteers to work harder and her supporters are voting in even bigger numbers. 
Clinton campaign chair John Podesta called Comey‚Äôs letter long on innuendo, short on facts. Podesta said the more information that comes out, the more this seems overblown. Podesta went off on Rep. Jason Chaffetz for distorting the facts and undermining his own legitimacy by claiming that the investigation was reopened. Podesta said that Comey had provided selective information that allowed partisans to distort the facts. 
Podesta said there‚Äôs no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing. He said if all the media reports are true, about the investigation having nothing to do with Hillary Clinton, it‚Äôs hard to see how this amounts to anything. 
Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chair called on Comey to provide answers to be public. 
Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook said that the Comey letter is motivating Clinton volunteers and supporters: 
Based on the anecdotes I am hearing from out team on the ground, this situation has created an urgency and intensity among our volunteers and activists that was already high because we are so close to the election. Our volunteers are rallying around Hillary They know what a fighter she is. 
‚Ä¶. 
They are turning out, not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote, as early voting goes into full swing. We‚Äôre not just seeing this in our offices, on the ground, but also in our online, in the online space as well. I think this is; we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday. I think that this has only increased the momentum that we‚Äôre feeling among our activists on the ground. 
Later Mook suggested that the Comey letter is helping the Clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire. It is likely that the Comey letter will backfire on Republicans and motivate Democrats to get out and support their nominee. 
An early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters. Hillary Clinton may end up benefiting from Comey‚Äôs actions because the FBI Director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her.

A newly surfaced video via Ryan Grim shows the Trump Humiliation game in action, which I walk everyone through from the POV of the woman. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
If you‚Äôre a woman who‚Äôs worked in any business where you‚Äôre forced to try to appease the massively sensitive ego of a sexually aggressive, vulgar man in power, you will know exactly what‚Äôs about to happen in this video. 
Donald Trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn. And there‚Äôs a newly surfaced video via Ryan Grim at Huffington Post that shows the Trump Humiliation game in action. 
In the video, Trump publicly sexualizes and shames the 2004 Miss Universe winner from Australia, Jennifer Hawkins as revenge. Before he does it, Trump tells the audience, ‚ÄúGet even with people. If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.‚Äù 
Watch this newly surfaced 2011 corporate speech here via Huffington Post (major trigger warning if you‚Äôve been there): 
Watching this you see the Trump modus operandi in action. This is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning Trump‚Äôs advances. The harassment as revenge. The sexual shaming. 
Trump sets the audience up for the Roman Gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should ‚Äúscrew‚Äù people back if they ‚Äúscrew‚Äù you. The sexually angry verb foreshadows what‚Äôs to come, because he is going to ‚Äúscrew‚Äù Jennifer Hawkins in public, when she realizes that because it‚Äôs public, she can‚Äôt further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions. 
Trump says he‚Äôs going to give them an example of his revenge theory, ‚ÄúJennifer Hawkins.‚Äù 
Trump orders Hawkins to the stage. The audience cheers and jeers, delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl. It‚Äôs to be a public spanking. So much fun. 
‚ÄúFirst of all, how beautiful is Jennifer,‚Äù Trump asks, claiming ownership of Jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking. The message: He can make or break her. She better play nice. 
Warning shot, ‚ÄúThis is about getting even.‚Äù 
Trump tells the audience that he was mad at Hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in Sydney. He tells the audience how mad he was, and then says, as she‚Äôs crossing the stage, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my favorite Miss Universe.‚Äù So she thinks maybe this isn‚Äôt going to be as bad as she fears. 
But then he stabs her publicly for the first time, ‚ÄúBut I think I like the new one better.‚Äù 
The audience loves it. He is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasn‚Äôt a good girl. She reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport. 
Hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing Trump, playing along with his game because she has to, but there will be no easy way out of this one. It won‚Äôt be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience. She will have to pay. 
‚ÄúI was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she‚Äôs not very bright,‚Äù Trump tells the audience, signaling that Hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for. 
‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt have been true, but I would have said it anyway,‚Äù Trump proudly tells the audience. This is his alpha male routine, except in real life, the alpha male doesn‚Äôt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl. But in the mind of little men like Trump, this makes him a winner. 
Trump points out that Hawkins is a big star now, but he helped her make it and then dissed him. He owns her. She must comply or face his wrath. Hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him, but Trump pushes her away from the microphone. This public shaming will be done from Trump‚Äôs POV only. No need for Hawkins to assert her personhood.There will be no defense allowed, because she‚Äôs already guilty. 
‚ÄúAnd you know what? She came tonight, she came ‚Äî came, she came, she came,‚Äù Trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at Christmas. He waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming, and they do. They get it. Hee heee. So clever. Came. Knuckles dragging on the floor clever. 
‚ÄúSee, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia,‚Äù Trump says. 
Trump grabs Hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her, just like he bragged about doing on the Bush tape. 
Hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them. The kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek. She is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him, but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact. She‚Äôs allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him, and pretended to fawn over him as required, but she will not, cannot, allow the kiss. The repulsive kiss. 
I‚Äôm telling this story as I imagine it to be from her point of view, although she has refused to comment. Of course she refused to comment, women are told they will be blackballed if they comment. The world is full of men like Trump, and they stick together. See Roger Ailes. Women have to play along and appease and if that doesn‚Äôt work, they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public, especially if they said no in private. 
I can only do this because I have lived it, somewhat like this, in public. And I have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job, while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body. 
From talking to so many women during this election, I know that I‚Äôm not alone. I know that many other women will watch this and know. They will feel the creep of fear and revulsion, the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest. How dare Hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce Trump. 
And other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it, setting you up to be humiliated even more. They will laugh about it and gossip about it, which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like Trump. Ironically, if you give in you‚Äôre not humiliated. It‚Äôs only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object. 
It‚Äôs not just the unwanted kiss, although that is disgusting and assault, much like Donald Trump bragged about doing on the Billy Bush bus tape. It‚Äôs the public humiliation and denigration. 
It‚Äôs the way the woman is forced, in front of thousands of people, to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge. 
It‚Äôs the way she tries to make it okay, to sweet-smooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire, and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her ‚Äúcome‚Äù and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss. 
If there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the Trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people, and that this kind of thing is horrific but it‚Äôs not all Trump‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the culture‚Äôs fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. 
In fact, this is shades of what Trump did to Hillary Clinton in the stalking debate, after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed.

‚Äî Geoff Garin (@geoffgarin) October 29, 2016 
It is still early, but if this were the election shifting news that Republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate. The reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign, it will be because Republicans are coming back to Trump. 
There are few undecided voters in this election, and even if all the Republican base come home to Trump, it won‚Äôt be enough for Trump to win, because he is losing where the presidential election is really held. Trump is getting crushed at the state level. 
Republicans have been trying to build Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails into a story for years, and they have failed at every turn. 
Hillary Clinton led the election while under Congressional investigation. Hillary Clinton led the election while under FBI investigation. Hillary Clinton is leading the election today. The message that Republicans and the media don‚Äôt want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails, and they don‚Äôt care. 
Voters are smarter than Republicans and the press give them credit for. The Hillary Clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that Clinton did anything wrong. 
If the polls tighten a little, this will be the best news in the world for Hillary Clinton and Democrats, because it will destroy any potential for Democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls. 
What Geoff Garin witnessed is probably going to end up being very accurate.

The FBI is examining how a Hillary Clinton aide handled emails. The examination has nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, her emails, or her email server. 
According to Newsweek‚Äôs Kurt Eichenwald, the ‚Äúscandal‚Äù is related to the process Clinton aide Huma Abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read. 
Eichenwald reported: Because Clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen, emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home, where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent. Abedin, like many State Department officials, found the government network technology to be cumbersome, and she had great trouble printing documents there, investigative records show. As a result, she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified State Department account to either her Yahoo account or her account on Clinton‚Äôs server, and printed the emails from there. It is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husband‚Äôs campaign. 
Abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed Clinton needed to see and when the Secretary forwarded emails to her for printing. Abedin told the FBI she would often print these emails without reading them. Abedin printed a large number of emails this way, in part because, investigative records show, other staff members considered her Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù and often sent Abedin electronic communications they wanted the Secretary to see. 
The entire scandal is about how emails were printed. It has nothing to do with how Hillary Clinton handled emails or classified information. The investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for Hillary Clinton to read. No wonder Comey didn‚Äôt provide more details in his letter to Congress. The details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the FBI. 
There is no evidence that Clinton‚Äôs aide committed a crime. For the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal, there must be evidence that Abedin intended to leak classified information. There remains zero evidence of criminal activity. 
The FBI examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the 2016 election , and Comey‚Äôs behavior is a disgrace to the US intelligence community. 
The new information destroys Republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat . Republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails, but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat. 
The emails won‚Äôt change anything in 2016, but they will give Congressional Republicans a reason to keep investigating Hillary Clinton in 2017 and beyond. In other words, James Comey is already delegitimizing Hillary Clinton‚Äôs potential presidency.";english;2016-10-29T21:05:49.223+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Bombshell New Details Destroy Republican Hopes In FBI Clinton Email Investigation;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Clinton-Trump-coward.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

At a rally in Golden, CO, Trump said:

Like people saying, ‚ÄúOh, here‚Äôs a ballot. Here‚Äôs another ballot. Throw it away. Oh, here‚Äôs one I like. We‚Äôll keep that one.‚Äù 
I have real problems, so get your ballots in. 
Trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots, as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. 
Donald Trump appears to be losing his mind. He also seems to think that accusing the US Postal Service and election officials of stealing the election for Hillary Clinton is going to motivate Republicans to vote. 
Consider the contradiction in Trump‚Äôs message. The Republican nominee tells his supporters that the US Postal Service is throwing away ballots, while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots. 
If their ballots are going to be thrown away by USPS, why should Republicans bother mailing their ballots in? 
It is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense. Trump‚Äôs inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why Republicans on pace to lose this election.

Although this campaign season has been interesting, to say the least, there is something happening one never thought would occur. After spending nearly eight years demonizing, obstructing, and criticizing every and anything about the President of the United States, Republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their ‚Äú imagined ‚Äù close ties to the Democratic President whose approval rating and popularity are growing. 
It is hypocritical, to say the least, and at some point a result of a toxic Republican candidate for the presidency, but for some GOP candidates it is a very dangerous strategy. If any Republican believed President Obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt, they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chief‚Äôs tolerance during an election. 
The President is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate Republicans for either ‚Äú belated rejection ‚Äù or continued support of Donald Trump. President Obama is also reminding Republicans that ‚Äú Donald Trump is the endpoint of eight years of [GOP] toxic hostility .‚Äù It may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that ‚Äú Obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every Republican who ever crossed him ,‚Äù but he is getting some well-placed and well-warranted shots at Republicans. 
Two Republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the President‚Äôs approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics; so it likely stunned the President that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed, opposed, and attempted to get rid of. 
Ohio Senator Rob Portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the President ‚Äúto break the grip of heroin addiction.‚Äù President Obama took the time to excoriate Portman for, 
‚Äú Finally withdrawing his support from Donald Trump ,‚Äù but only ‚Äú After looking at the polling. Now that it‚Äôs politically expedient. But he has supported him up until last week? So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists ‚Ä¶ and insulting Gold Star moms, making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didn‚Äôt quite tip it over the edge. Why was that OK? And now he says he will vote for the vice-presidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports Donald Trump. ‚Äù 
The President was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the President ‚Äú one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times,‚Äù California Republican Representative Daryl Issa, is sending out campaign mailers with the President‚Äôs face on them and boasting about his close work with President Obama ‚Äú to protect victims of sexual assault .‚Äù 
Daryl Issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the President‚Äôs wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on Issa-created scandals. During a fundraiser in La Jolla California Sunday last, the President assailed Issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the President‚Äôs image on it. The President said, 
‚Äú Issa‚Äôs primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. This is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. Now that is the definition of chutzpah.‚Äù 
As remarked by Tim Murphy at Mother Jones, President Obama is not just evening up the score with Republicans who made his tenure miserable, ‚Äú He is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight years‚Äîto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in Republicans‚Äô faces .‚Äù 
The President clearly has a lot of ‚Äú words ‚Äù to harangue Republicans with. He said , 
‚Äú Here‚Äôs the thing. For years, Republican politicians and the far-right media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me. About Hillary. About Harry. They said I wasn‚Äôt born here. They said climate change is a hoax. They said that I was going to take everybody‚Äôs guns away! They said that while we were doing military exercises that we‚Äôve been doing forever, suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law. This is what they‚Äôve been saying for years now! So people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe it‚Äôs true! And if the world they‚Äôve been seeing is I‚Äôm powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybody‚Äôs guns in the middle of the night and impose martial law‚Äîeven though I can‚Äôt talk without a ‚Äòprompter‚Äîthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like Donald Trump? 
And the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. There are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what this‚Äôll help rile up the base, it‚Äôll give us an excuse to obstruct what we‚Äôre trying to do, we won‚Äôt be able to appoint judges, we‚Äôll gum up the works, we‚Äôll create gridlock, it‚Äôll give us a political advantage. So they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff. So Donald Trump did not start this. Donald Trump didn‚Äôt start it, he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. That‚Äôs what he always does. And so now, when suddenly it‚Äôs not working and people are saying wow this guy‚Äôs kind of out of line, all of a sudden these Republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly they‚Äôre all walking away. Oh, this is too much. So when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly that‚Äôs a deal-breaker. Well what took you so long! What the heck! What took you so long! All these years!‚Äù 
The Mother Jones piece made out like President Obama is seeking retribution, or ‚Äú revenge ‚Äù against Republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years. Without knowing what goes on in the President‚Äôs head to motivate his campaign rhetoric; that is a hard call to make with any surety. Barack Obama does not strike one as being vindictive. 
The President is, though, an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the White House is winding down and Republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from Donald Trump, it is prudent of the President to remind voters exactly what Republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why Donald Trump is their standard bearer; and why Republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning Trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the White House.";english;2016-10-29T22:54:59.504+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;President Obama Gets Real, Not Revenge, On Republicans;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/obama-rigged-election.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

""What's that?"" he asked. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Gabriel Sherman writes at New York Mag that when Donald Trump attacked the Khan family over Khizr Khan‚Äôs speech at the Democratic National Convention, he had no idea what a Gold Star family was. 
You will remember that Khizr Khan stood up in front of the entire world and said to Donald Trump, ‚ÄúLet me ask you, ‚ÄòHave you even read the United States Consitution?‚Äô I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words ‚Äòliberty‚Äô and ‚Äòequal protection of the law.‚Äô‚Äù 
The fallout was predictable. Donald Trump, openly criticized, lost it. He attacked the Khan‚Äôs religious beliefs, saying ‚ÄúIf you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn‚Äôt allowed to have anything to say.‚Äù 
Now it turns out that he had no idea what he was doing. Because he is ignorant, and because, as Mark Cuban has observed, he isn‚Äôt interested in learning anything. Gabriel Sherman explains: 
‚ÄúYou do know you just attacked a Gold Star family?‚Äù one adviser warned Trump. Trump didn‚Äôt know what a Gold Star family was: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù he asked. To Trump, Khizr Khan and his wife, Ghazala, were enemies who had said something mean about him, just like Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell and any number of people who had gotten under his skin over the years. Wasn‚Äôt it his right to respond? ‚Äú‚ÄÖ‚ÄòThe election is about the American people, it‚Äôs not about you,‚Äô‚ÄÖ‚Äù Manafort told Trump, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Trump countered with Breitbart‚Äôs report on Khan‚Äôs purported belief in Sharia. ‚Äú‚ÄÖ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs not running for president,‚Äô‚ÄÖ‚Äù Manafort shot back. ‚Äú‚ÄÖ‚ÄòThe Clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message.‚Äô‚ÄÖ‚Äù 
Of course, Trump could not and would not admit his own ignorance and he certainly wasn‚Äôt prepared to take the blame. Instead, as Sherman reveals, he ‚Äútook it out on Manafort in front of his senior advisors, including Ailes.‚Äù According to Trump, Manafort wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúable to get the media to focus on the right stuff.‚Äù 
No wonder, when Trump refuses to take Manafort‚Äôs advice and focus on the right stuff. This is not to defend Manafort, who is at least as despicable as his boss, but it serves as an example of how Trump‚Äôs first reaction each and every time is to get back at his critic. 
It was one of Donald Trump‚Äôs most visible Joe McCarthy moments, and his response to Khizr Khan actually reinforced the point Khan was trying to make. 
Stopping and thinking are foreign to him. And if you are not astonished by the appalling ignorance on display here, you should not be. This is all in keeping with a party that prides itself on ignorance rather than facts.";english;2016-10-29T23:17:00.600+03:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;When Trump Attacked the Khans, He Didn‚Äôt Know What a Gold Star Family Was;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/khizr-khan-dnc.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

It may be the understatement of the year to say the Republican Party is on the verge of a full-on civil war, and it may be obvious to many Americans that the blame for the inter-party discord is its standard bearer Donald J. Trump. However much Trump‚Äôs candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of Trump‚Äôs reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion-minded Trump supporters, the real instigators are the Koch brothers. 
Although the oil magnates were never on the Trump bandwagon, they are responsible for the Trump loyalists within the GOP who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nation‚Äôs political system and indeed, the workings of government itself. The tea party caucus, an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former House Speaker John A. Boehner out of Congress, morphed into the inaptly- named Freedom caucus that has embraced Trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isn‚Äôt solely to put current Speaker Paul Ryan out of a job, although that is high on the Trump supporters‚Äô to-do list. 
As noted in Wednesday‚Äôs New York Times, ‚Äú Mr. Trump‚Äôs supporters said they were determined to harness the anti-establishment energy that Mr. Trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the Republican leadership in Congress ‚Äî a target many of them seem‚Ä¶eager to take down .‚Äù 
The right-wing extremist that actually ‚Äú took down ‚Äù former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, conservative extremist and House Freedom Caucus member David Brat, issued a warning to establishment Republicans: 
‚Äú There‚Äôs a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to D.C. Leadership comes and smacks our guy? That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre going to put down a marker? Really? And the American people are just scratching their head saying, ‚ÄòReally? That‚Äôs rich .‚Äô‚Äù 
Brat has been a thorn in the establishment‚Äôs side since Paul Ryan became Speaker and he joins a dangerous number of ‚Äú real conservatives ‚Äù who cannot understand or comport with Ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize Trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after Hillary Clinton. 
Donald Trump and a few of his ‚Äú senior aides ‚Äù are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending Trump. In fact, besides assailing Ryan for not sticking by Trump, it is reported that Trump said privately that Ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the Trump candidacy. And, during an interview with Reuters he complained that ‚Äú The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent, if we had support from the top .‚Äù Win or lose, there is going to be a major blood-letting after the election and the establishment, although powerful, may face a Herculean task to save the party. 
This impending conflict within the GOP has been brewing longer than Donald Trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti-establishment devotee to run his campaign. The chairman of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, had made it one of his primary goals to get Paul Ryan out as House Speaker because he is not a ‚Äútrue conservative‚Äù intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber-conservative paradise. And ‚Äúuber-conservative‚Äù is just a different way of saying a ‚Äú non-government ‚Äù according to the Koch brothers‚Äô vision of American libertarianism. Don‚Äôt believe it? 
Two groups closely aligned with the Koch brothers, Heritage Action for America and FreedomWorks , have been pushing Republicans as a Party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the party‚Äôs decisions; something establishment types are resisting. 
Over the past few days, leaders of both Koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next, or new, speaker of the House; something typically occurring directly after the general election in November regardless the outcome. 
According to the chief executive of Heritage Action, Michael Needham, there is going to be Hell to pay for establishment Republicans if they don‚Äôt bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the Kochs and heavily courted by Donald Trump. Mr. Needham said, 
‚Äú If the party doesn‚Äôt learn lessons and change based on what‚Äôs gone on for the last year and a half, I think it‚Äôs going to be just catastrophe .‚Äù 
Another conservative extremist, House Freedom Caucus member and ardent Donald Trump supporter echoed Needham‚Äôs sentiment and said, ‚Äú You can‚Äôt ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle. ‚Äù 
The dilemma for Republicans after the election, no matter the outcome, is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party. That doesn‚Äôt seem likely because if Trump loses, big or small, the extremists will unleash whatever level of Hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of Trump‚Äôs more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump. If Trump wins, the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on November 8, it will not be the end of hostilities among Republicans. 
The Republican Party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the United States or shutting down the government as a show of anger. After four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative, and the past year-and-a-half of incitement by Donald Trump, the Republican Party faces a serious threat to its long-term survival. It is a threat that began about six years ago when the Koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that Donald Trump took advantage of to seize control of the Republican Party.";english;2016-10-30T02:03:36.590+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Koch Brothers Helped Incite the Impending Bloodbath Among Republicans;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/elephant-broken.jpg;0;1;699;0;699;bias

By Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla./GOLDEN, Colo. (Reuters) ‚Äì Democrat Hillary Clinton‚Äôs top aides on Saturday lashed out at FBI Director James Comey for igniting a new controversy over a long-running private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading ‚Äúinnuendo.‚Äù 
Comey, who has headed the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2013, notified the U.S. Congress on Friday that the agency is again reviewing emails, even though in July it decided not to seek prosecution of Clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state. 
John Podesta, who heads Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign, told reporters that Comey‚Äôs letter to Congress was ‚Äúlight on facts, heavy on innuendo,‚Äù and he urged Comey to ‚Äúcome forward and give those answers to the American public‚Äù about the exact nature of the FBI‚Äôs latest review of emails. 
Sources close to the investigation on Friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. 
Weiner, a former U.S. congressman from New York, is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. 
With the Nov. 8 elections quickly approaching, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pounded away at the new FBI development, devoting a large part of a campaign speech in Golden, Colorado, to attacking Clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency. 
‚ÄúHer criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful,‚Äù Trump said, standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn. ‚ÄúHillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure.‚Äù 
Comey, however, has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the FBI or the nature of their contents. 
Clinton‚Äôs campaign tried to play down the new review. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing,‚Äù Podesta said, in the FBI‚Äôs latest announcement that it was taking ‚Äúappropriate investigative steps‚Äù after learning of emails ‚Äúthat appear to be pertinent‚Äù to the earlier probe. 
Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign, said Americans had already ‚Äúfactored‚Äù what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots. 
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see it changing the landscape‚Äù for undecided voters, Mook said. 
Clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters. 
Clinton was campaigning in Florida on Saturday, a battleground state that many analysts say Trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected. 
In recent weeks, Trump has been running behind Clinton in most public opinion polls. 
Justice Department officials, according to a source who asked not to be identified, were opposed to the FBI director‚Äôs letter being sent to Congress and believe his actions conflict with a Justice Department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections. 
While Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not discuss the matter directly with Comey, the source said aides were in touch with each other. 
Comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a follow-up to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the FBI‚Äôs probe of Clinton‚Äôs emails, the source said. 
Meanwhile, Clinton supporters rallied to her defense following Friday‚Äôs FBI disclosure. 
The Congressional Black Caucus, comprised of about 45 members of the House of Representatives, nearly all Democrats, held a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, and urged Comey to release more details.

By Maurice Tamman 
NEW YORK (Reuters) ‚Äì With 11 days to go before the U.S. presidential election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project. 
Though data is not available for all early voting states, Clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as Ohio and Arizona and in Republican Party strongholds such as Georgia and Texas. 
An estimated 19 million Americans have voted so far in the election, according to the University of Florida‚Äôs United States Election Project, accounting for as much as 20 percent of the electorate. 
Overall, Clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the Electoral College, the Reuters/Ipsos survey showed. 
Having so many ballots locked down before the Nov. 8 election is good news for the Clinton campaign. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to Clinton‚Äôs close aide, Huma Abedin. Those emails were found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, Abedin‚Äôs estranged husband, during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl. The Reuters/Ipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged Friday afternoon. 
It remains unclear whether the FBI inquiry will upset the balance in the race. The bureau disclosed nothing about the Abedin emails, including whether any of the messages were sent by or to Clinton. Over the summer, the FBI said it was closing its investigation into Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email system while secretary of state. Until Friday, her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial FBI email probe. 
Clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the Trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances. Trump has said none of the accusations are true. He also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes. 
As of Thursday, Clinton‚Äôs odds of receiving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent, according to State of the Nation polling results released Saturday. The project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218, with 278 votes solidly for the Democrat. 
Clinton‚Äôs lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney at this point of the 2012 race, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken at the time. Obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to Romney‚Äôs 206. 
But even before the latest email news, it had been a difficult week for Clinton. News coverage of Trump‚Äôs accusers had diminished, while Clinton confronted the almost daily release by WikiLeaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign manager‚Äôs account. This week‚Äôs leaked messages raised questions about former President Bill Clinton‚Äôs finances. 
And her lead in the States of the Nation project fell slightly from last week. Though the projected Electoral College votes hardly moved, the number of states solidly for Clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week. Trump didn‚Äôt see any additional states tilt solidly to him, but he did see some gains: The swing states of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada all moved from leaning to Clinton to being too close to call. 
Still, Trump‚Äôs path to a victory is narrow, and any realistic chance rests on his winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. As of Thursday, Ohio remained a toss-up. Florida and North Carolina were still tilting toward Clinton, according to the States of the Nation results. 
Early voting data for Florida and North Carolina was not yet available this week. In Ohio, Clinton led Trump by double digits among early voters. The project‚Äôs broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates. 
In Arizona, Clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters. In the past month, Arizona has gradually moved from a solid Trump state to a marginal Clinton state, although it is still too close to call, according to the project results. 
In Georgia, she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters. Overall, Georgia leans to Trump, but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week, down from eights points last week and 13 points a month ago. 
Even in Texas, where Trump enjoys a sizable lead, Clinton has a double-digit edge among early voters, according to project results. 
The States of the Nation project is a survey of about 15,000 people every week in all 50 states plus Washington D.C. State by state results are available by visiting http://www.reuters.com/statesofthenation/

Not only is Donald Trump a liar and a thin-skinned crybaby, but he is selfish, never spending his own money when he can spend somebody else‚Äôs. This behavior was never more in evidence than The Washington Post ‚Äòs David Fahrenthold‚Äôs account of a 1996 a ribbon-cutting held by the Association to Benefit Children for a nursery school, when Donald Trump showed up, sat down to appear to be a great supporter, and then left without leaving a donation: 
As Sopan Deb tweeted , 
‚Äî Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 29, 2016 
Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford were big donors and it is no wonder Gifford was so shocked by Trump‚Äôs presence. What had been exposed is that Trump‚Äôs life is a sham, a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not. 
As Fahrenthold explains , 
For as long as he has been rich and famous, Donald Trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public ‚Äî even nationally televised ‚Äî promises to give his own money away. It was, in large part, a facade. A months-long investigation by The Washington Post has not been able to verify many of Trump‚Äôs boasts about his philanthropy. 
That philanthropist isn‚Äôt the real Trump. The only person Trump visibly cares about is Donald Trump. He uses his Foundation to buy himself nice things, spending other peoples‚Äô money for luxury items and collectibles. When he does make donations, it is again, because he gives no money to his own Foundation, with other peoples‚Äô money. 
Fahrenthold says that the only donation of Trump‚Äôs own money the paper could find from the period of 2008 to today, is a $10,000 ‚Äúgift to the Police Athletic League of New York City, in 2009.‚Äù 
For a man as rich as Trump claims to be, $10,000 in eight years is nothing to brag about. Not that this stops the monumental, deadbeat hypocrite that is Donald Trump from bragging anyway.";english;2016-10-30T02:03:36.811+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;David Fahrenthold Strikes, Exposing Donald Trump‚Äôs False Philanthropy;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/trump-pout.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Coming from people who believe in something called ‚Äúspiritual warfare‚Äù‚Äì a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions ‚Äì it is perhaps no surprise that the Religious Right should declare that their messiah ‚Äì Donald Trump ‚Äì is being threatened with witchcraft. 
Lance Wallnau, whose Twitter page claims to be ‚ÄúYour Spiritual Warfare Guide to the 2016 Election,‚Äù appeared on ‚ÄúThe Jim Bakker Show‚Äù to push the crazy idea that ‚Äúmany Christians feel this fog on their head at times‚Äù and ‚Äúthat fog that‚Äôs on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because there‚Äôs spirits being authorized to be released.‚Äù 
Watch courtesy of Right Wing Watch: 
Oh sweet baby Jesus, the mighty Lance has struck out. What has happened, of course, is that the Religious Right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion. It‚Äôs no wonder they feel in a fog . Metaphorically or physically, they‚Äôre selling their souls. 
Wallnau claims ‚ÄúThe left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of Christ who doesn‚Äôt work together,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the dilemma that America‚Äôs in right now,‚Äù even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the Religious Right has been organizing since Goldwater lost in ‚Äô64 . 
A hypocrite just can‚Äôt catch a break, it seems: 
The web literally is coming down on America. And what‚Äôs sad is, how many Christians feel this fog on their head at times? Do you feel that? It‚Äôs almost like everything‚Äôs going wrong. We don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the American culture and discipling the country. And that fog that‚Äôs on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because there‚Äôs spirits being authorized to be released. 
Wherever there‚Äôs agreement, there‚Äôs power. The more unbelievers agree with the narrative that they‚Äôre hearing, the more power and authorization Satan has to manifest. So unless the church has an exposure of what the enemy‚Äôs doing and begins to agree together with a counter-strategy, we‚Äôre going to deal with more and more fog. And the worst part is‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have to surrender nations to the devil. 
So if you disagree with Wallnau, if you oppose Trump, it can only because you‚Äôre manifesting the power of Satan (who in the Old Testament is God‚Äôs lieutenant, not his adversary). So pick your Testament, I suppose. 
Lance Wallnau insists he is ‚Äúnot a big conspiracy theorist buff,‚Äù but this doesn‚Äôt do anything to convince us he‚Äôs not some wack-a-doodle instead. This is nothing new, as a non-Christian being told that you represent a ‚Äúdevil‚Äù you don‚Äôt even believe exists. 
There are 2,000 years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize (or worse) their opponents. 
Without charges of Satanism and witchcraft, you don‚Äôt have the genocide of European and Middle Eastern Paganism; you don‚Äôt have anti-Jewish pogroms; and you don‚Äôt have the Crusades or the Spanish Inquisition; you don‚Äôt have witch-burnings. 
What this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that we‚Äôre not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents. 
Not only do they deal in a conspiracy-laden world, a world free of facts, but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason ‚Äì and let‚Äôs go ahead and say sanity ‚Äì do not. 
Let‚Äôs face it: Donald Trump‚Äôs biggest enemy is not Satan, but Donald Trump himself. And Wallnau can claim ‚Äúbelievers have an edge‚Äù all they want, but all the belief in the world won‚Äôt overturn reality.";english;2016-10-30T08:42:07.772+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Yes, The Religious Right Warns Witchcraft Could Decide This Election;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/trump-anointing.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Video: 
Chuck Todd asked Mook if he believed the email story could cost Clinton the election. 
He answered: 
I don‚Äôt think so. Look, as I said, we have over 50,000 volunteers out there. We‚Äôre seeing record early voting numbers in North Carolina, Florida. Look, I would wager in Nevada turnout is so strong among Democrats there Hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in Nevada. We‚Äôre feeling really good about this record turnout. Over 200 million people in our country now registered to vote. Fifty million of those are young people. We‚Äôre just nose to the grindstone, and we‚Äôre going to finish this out. But people should not take anything for granted, and we‚Äôre going to have to work hard to earn this.‚Äù 
Hillary Clinton could put Nevada out of reach for Trump this week, but whether or not that happens is up to the voters. If Democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states, the email story won‚Äôt matter. If Democrats don‚Äôt show up, that is Trump‚Äôs only chance of winning. 
The early voting numbers that Hillary Clinton is running up in Florida, North Carolina, and Nevada are no accident. Clinton and the Democratic Party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states. 
Democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the 2016 election, but Donal Trump‚Äôs refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area. 
The final week before the election could be just as vital to Democrats in swing states as election day. If Hillary Clinton piles up big margins in early voting, it could leave minimal drama for election night. 
The Democratic early voting plan is working to perfection, now as Mook said, all that is left is for Democrats to put their heads down, work hard, and close the deal.

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
The CBS News Republicans hoped that FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs letter about new Clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of CBS News Battleground polls shows Clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of Trump in Arizona. 
Battleground tracker found that by a small margin Comey‚Äôs letter made Democrats more likely (net +7) to support Clinton. 
In the individual battleground states, Clinton leads by eight points in Pennsylvania 48%-40%, North Carolina (48%-45%), and in Colorado (42%-39%). The only state of the four polled where Trump has a small two point lead in Arizona (44%-42%). 
According to CBS News , ‚ÄúAnd the larger demographic difference defining the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has been a gender gap ‚Äì slightly larger now than the last time in these states ‚Äì that offsets a smaller movement of Republicans to Trump.‚Äù 
To put it another way, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs support with women is going up at a larger rate than Republican movement towards Trump. 
These are the first swing state polls to be taken since FBI Director Comey released his now infamous letter on Friday. The email story isn‚Äôt moving voters. It is reinforcing the partisanship of the election. Democrats are going to vote Clinton. Republicans are going to vote for Trump, and there aren‚Äôt enough undecided voters to swing the election to Trump. 
Republicans were hoping for a Hail Mary touchdown to save Trump, but Clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day. If the Comey letter is the big October surprise, it isn‚Äôt working on voters.

The FBI Director has interfered in a presidential election with new emails that have nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, but can be used by her opponents for political purposes.

Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. 
And that is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers‚Äô ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W.

This is the second complaint to be filed against FBI Director Comey. The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has also filed a complaint against Comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee. 
Suspicion around Comey‚Äôs actions has grown as the FBI Director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election. Director Comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as Senate Democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the FBI investigation if they win back the Senate majority. 
Unless Trump wins and Republicans take control of Congress, Director Comey is going to have to answer for his decisions.

Talk about burying the lede. 
In Senator Harry Reid‚Äôs letter in which he suggests that FBI Director James Comey may have broken the law (the Hatch Law), he also drops the bomb that the FBI and national security experts possess ‚Äúexplosive information‚Äù about ties and coordination between Russia and Donald Trump and his campaign. 
Reid writes, ‚ÄúIn my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government ‚Äì a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity.‚Äù 
Reid points out the ‚Äúdisturbing double standard‚Äù in Comey‚Äôs treatment of sensitive information between the two parties with a ‚Äúclear intent‚Äù to aid one over the other. 
If the FBI and national security experts have information that Donald Trump and or his campaign are colluding or collaborating to bring about a particular result regarding the U.S. election or our foreign policy stances, this is an emergency. 
Which issue is so much of an emergency that a federal official might consider dropping the bomb just 11 days before an election: Electing someone who is conspiring with Russia or electing someone whose aide may have sent an email she forget to tell everyone about. 
The double standard is not only troubling at this point, but dangerous. 
Bomb dropped. 
Everyone already suspected Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia and his campaign has been full of ties to the Kremlin, but now Reid has confirmed information about coordination between Trump and Russia. 
Now that, ladies and gentlemen, is an October shocker.

The Trump campaign is now that reality detached place where a few true believers are running the show. This is why Trump is going to spend the last week of his presidential campaign in blue states that he has no chance of winning. Trump still thinks that he can win Michigan, Wisconsin, and New Mexico. Wisconsin might be the most laughable of three delusions because Trump was routed in the Republican primary there, and GOP support from Wisconsin Republicans like Paul Ryan and Scott Walker has been lukewarm at best. 
These are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat. The Comey letter didn‚Äôt move the needle for Trump. It didn‚Äôt give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for Hillary Clinton.

This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they don‚Äôt like. Plain and simple. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
On Friday, the Supreme Court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of Gloucester County School Board vs. G.G . This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they don‚Äôt like. Plain and simple. 
At issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with. 
Last summer, the court granted the school board‚Äôs request to put a lower court ruling in the student‚Äôs favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the Supreme Court. Justice Breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy. 
The Virginia school board established a policy mirroring ‚Äúbathroom police‚Äù laws in red states like North Carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth. 
In this case, the district court ruled against G.G. by relying on a 1975 regulation allowing schools to provide ‚Äúseparate toilet, locker room and shower facilities based on sex‚Äù provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex. 
In January 2015, the Department of Education‚Äôs Office of Civil Rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a ‚Äúschool must treat transgender students‚Äù in a manner consistent ‚Äúwith their gender identity.‚Äù 
Because of that letter, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of G.G. It relied on a 1997 Supreme Court decision that courts generally should defer to an agency‚Äôs interpretation of its own regulation. 
In reality, the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case. First, this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender, which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women, POC and members of the LGBT community. Second, the right wing is hoping to weaken Federal Agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own regulations.";english;2016-10-31T05:57:56.791+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Supreme Court Decides to Weigh in On Transgender Rights;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1001Supreme-Court.jpg;0;1;167;0;167;bias

CNN‚Äôs Brian Stelter calls Donald Trump a ‚Äúuniquely fact-challenged candidate,‚Äù which is a prelude to introducing Daniel Dale, Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star , who fact checks every single word Trump utters and tallies them up for his paper .

‚Äî Reliable Sources (@ReliableSources) October 30, 2016 
The mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between Trump and Clinton. As Dale told Stelter, ‚ÄúThere is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty.‚Äù Trump, says Dale, ‚Äúis not a normal political liar.‚Äù 
For example, look at the presidential debates , in which Dale found 104 Trump false statements as opposed to 13 by Clinton. 
Dale‚Äôs judgment is that ‚Äúthere is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent.‚Äù 
Trump also lies ‚Äúpointlessly,‚Äù argues Dale, explaining to Brian Stelter that, 
‚ÄúHe gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases, it is not clear whether he‚Äôs lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts.‚Äù 
This was Mark Cuban‚Äôs complaint, of course, that Trump has no interest in learning. 
In the end, it matters less why Trump lies than that he does, especially since he is busily convincing his base that Hillary Clinton is the dishonest candidate. And it is working. This is a trope frequently repeated by Trump‚Äôs supporters. You can correct them as often as you want; it will have no effect. 
The lie has taken hold ‚Äì one of many ‚Äì many more than you likely expected, and observational bias takes care of the rest. The Trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality, and as Dale tweeted last night, 
‚ÄúIf Trump loses, the Smart Republican Excavation is going to have to involve some long, hard base re-education.‚Äù 
Given the GOP‚Äôs history with facts, good luck with that.

If passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries""   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* 
For almost all secular humanists, organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation. Throughout recorded history, the Catholic Church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents, but any humans it comes in contact with. That lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the 21st Century and in America like the rest of the Earth the Catholics number one focus has been on controlling women. Apparently, the Catholic Church in Massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population. 
On Friday the Boston Globe reported that the Archdiocese of Boston dropped about a million dollars in a last-ditch effort to exert Church control over Massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use. Other reports reveal that the tax-exempt political spending is meant to help defeat a Massachusetts ballot measure, Question 4 . Question 4 simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over 21 and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of Massachusetts. Question 4 contains no references to the Catholic, or any other church, and makes no claim of trying to ‚Äú impact ministries .‚Äù 
A spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese, Terrence Donilon, made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the Catholic church‚Äôs political donation to the campaign against Massachusetts‚Äô version of legalized recreational marijuana saying : 
‚Äú It reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. It‚Äôs a recognition that, if passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries .‚Äù 
Seriously, that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use tax-free congregants‚Äô donations to interfere in an election ever offered. Nowhere in Massachusetts‚Äô or any state‚Äôs decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned, much less affected by the outcome of an election. Catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis. And despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes, the Church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes, and the USCCB will still attempt to control and dominate all American women. No reefer decriminalization will impact the Catholic ministry, but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession, free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests, and relieve America‚Äôs over-burdened judicial system. 
Now, the Catholics claim that people using cannabis legally, whether they inhale or eat it, will have ‚Äú significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries .‚Äù That is an odd assertion on yet another point; Surely part of ‚ÄúCatholic ministries‚Äù is teaching according to their god‚Äôs word in the Christian bible. It is nearly certain that every Catholic priest on the planet, including those in Massachusetts, are aware of god‚Äôs word in Genesis where in chapter 2, verse 9 the Catholics‚Äô ‚Äú almighty god ‚Äù said: 
‚Äú Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food. ‚Äù And he continues in verses 15-17 , ‚Äú Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. The LORD God commanded the man, saying, ‚ÄúFrom any tree of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die .‚Äù 
Although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities 10,000 years ago , there is no record of reefer ever being confused with ‚Äú The tree of the knowledge of good and evil; ‚Äù weed is not and will not affect the Catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past two-thousand years the Catholic Church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal. 
In a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with tax-exempt money, an advocate and spokesman for the Yes on Question 4, Jim Borghesani, said : 
‚Äú The archdiocese has come up with a position that, frankly, we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science. What I think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that (marijuana) prohibition has done to people of color, to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because they‚Äôve been arrested .‚Äù 
One wonders if part of the Boston archdiocese‚Äôs ministry entails increasing the number of Americans, mainly Americans of color, sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that ‚Äú god caused to grow ‚Äù and was ‚Äú pleasing to the sight and good to eat .‚Äù Obviously, that is the case and according to a new set of data, keeping marijuana illegal means keeping Americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every 25 seconds of every day of the year. 
Why is the Catholic Church so interested in perpetuating the failed ‚ÄúWar on Drugs in general, and the criminalization of marijuana in particular?‚Äù As noted by Michael Stone over at Patheos, what the Massachusetts Catholics, and Mormons, are actually helping to sustain is ‚Äú in reality a war on poor people and people of color .‚Äù Mr. Stone really nails it when he said that by spending tax-exempt donations on a political agenda to ‚Äú defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana; the Catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed War on Drugs and the New Jim Crow .‚Äù 
The archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy, besides implicit racism. Because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using tax-exempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is ‚Äú morally indefensible .‚Äù Mormons are also busy instructing LDS members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private Mormon lives or their LDS ministry, but they allegedly don‚Äôt condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites; at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned. 
The Massachusetts Catholics may not be violating the law by ‚Äú acting as an anti-marijuana super PAC ,‚Äù but they are using tax-exempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other Americans‚Äô lives; the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of American society. However, if the Church is so flush with money; why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the Church‚Äôs pedophile priests? Or, dog forbid, use that tax-exempt donors‚Äô money to help the people of Massachusetts in need. 
The Catholic Church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents, and that is down to frightened people needing a ‚Äò daddy‚Äô figure in the Church to tell them what is right, what is wrong, and how to stay out of the proverbial Hell; that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity. But for people that are not ‚Äú in the church ‚Äù it is an affront to use donated tax-exempt money to impact (read control) their private lives. The only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like Question 4 will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregation‚Äôs hard-earned money. 
This is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and American citizen, except Donald Trump. It is ‚Äú morally obnoxious ‚Äù that the archdiocese is using the congregations‚Äô donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with tax-exempt funds wrung out of hardworking Americans, many of whom use recreational cannabis.

We‚Äôre fighting on a different level! we have to be tough...and in some cases pretty vicious""   
Donald Trump complains about spending a fortune on a war in the Middle East that he supported, a war brought to us by a Republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts. Trump is also lying about the facts, which at least brings our country‚Äôs Middle East ordeal full-circle. 
According to Trump, speaking at a rally in New Mexico ‚Äì and you‚Äôve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie ‚Äì ‚ÄúHillary brought disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya and every place that she touches. She empowered Iran and she unleashed ISIS by leaving that big vacuum.‚Äù 
Of course, it was Republican President George W. Bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with Iraq, stipulating that America draw down its combat strength. Reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in Iraq, or a negation of ISIS, but a second U.S. invasion on top of the rise of ISIS. 
‚ÄúWe want peace through strength,‚Äù Trump told the crowd. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads.‚Äù 
Well, in fact we DID want to be in that war. We invaded Iraq, not vice versa. 
Trump went on to say, 
‚ÄúDrowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand. We haven‚Äôt had ‚Äì this is medieval times. This is medieval times and then we can‚Äôt do waterboarding, it‚Äôs far too tough! You know, we‚Äôre fighting on a different level! See, we‚Äôre fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious, to be honest with you. Pretty vicious, but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country ‚Äì we‚Äôve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East. $6 trillion. And we could‚Äôve rebuilt our country twice.‚Äù 
Never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law; never mind that a 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee‚Äôs report said torture doesn‚Äôt work; Trump‚Äôs argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him. 
This is Trump wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale, and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means. 
He doesn‚Äôt, because he can‚Äôt, prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesn‚Äôt make us barbarians ourselves. He certainly can‚Äôt prove, because that Senate report says otherwise, that torturing people will win the war. 
The claim of $6 million, by the way, is one Trump made last week in Charlotte, NC as well, and PolitiFact ruled it ‚Äúhalf true‚Äù at the time, saying, 
Trump is citing the high-end estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet he is confusing money that‚Äôs been spent with money that researchers say will be spent. 
The point here is that this is a war begun not by Obama and certainly not by Hillary Clinton, who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so, while Trump continued to deny he was ever for it, despite the facts to the contrary. 
When Trump says ‚Äúwe have to be pretty vicious‚Äù he is also saying ‚Äúwe have to be pretty dishonest,‚Äù and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as Donald Trump.

If you‚Äôve run into these people in a comment section or forums you know they have the campaign message down so exactly as to be a screaming siren of talking points.

Said under oath: Was destroying them whole time.‚Äù Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Newsweek‚Äô s Kurt Eichenwald has struck again, reporting that Donald Trump ‚Äúrefused 2 produce records sought by prosecutors for 6 months. Said under oath: Was destroying them whole time.‚Äù 
The whole strategy, he writes at Newsweek in an article he swears was written before Comey‚Äôs announcement, was ‚Äúdeny, impede and delay, while destroying documents the court had ordered them to hand over.‚Äù 
In 1973, he reveals, ‚Äúthe Republican nominee, his father and their real estate company battled the federal government over civil charges that they refused to rent apartments to African-Americans.‚Äù 
Shortly after the government filed its case in October, Trump attacked: He falsely declared to reporters that the feds had no evidence he and his father discriminated against minorities, but instead were attempting to force them to lease to welfare recipients who couldn‚Äôt pay their rent.The family‚Äôs attempts to slow down the federal case were at times nonsensical. Trump submitted an affidavit contending that the government had engaged in some unspecified wrongdoing by releasing statements to the press on the day it brought the case without first having any ‚Äúformal communications‚Äù with him; he contended that he‚Äôd learned of the complaint only while listening to his car radio that morning. But Trump‚Äôs sworn statement was a lie. Court records show that the government had filed its complaint at 10 a.m. and phoned him almost immediately afterward. The government later notified the media with a press release. [‚Ä¶] Six months after the original filing, the case was nowhere because the Trumps had repeatedly ignored the deadlines to produce records and answers to questions, known as interrogatories‚Ä¶.Finally, under subpoena, Trump appeared for a short deposition. When asked about the missing documents, he made a shocking admission: The Trumps had been destroying their corporate records for the previous six months and had no document-retention program. They had conducted no inspections to determine which files might have been sought in the discovery requests or might otherwise be related to the case. Instead, in order to ‚Äúsave space,‚Äù Trump testified, officials with his company had been tossing documents into the shredder and garbage. 
So Trump can accuse Hillary Clinton of destroying emails ‚Äì and he does, nearly every day ‚Äì but only as a means of covering up and deflecting his own misdeeds in that regard. 
‚ÄúWith false affidavits and ‚Äòdeny and delay‚Äù strategies,‚Äù writes Eichenwald, ‚ÄúTrump & his cos hid and destroyed records sought in court.‚Äù 
Donald Trump is a world class liar and a man known for his deflection tactics, projecting his own guilt onto others. His Foundation in trouble? Point the finger at the Clinton Foundation. Sexual assault allegations? Point the finger at Bill and Hillary Clinton. 
Once again, Kurt Eichenwald has dug into Donald Trump‚Äôs deplorable past and revealed the real Donald Trump. It‚Äôs not pretty. And each revelation from Eichenwald and David Fahrenthold shows Trump to be an even worse human being than the last. 
It is no wonder his deplorables love him so much.

The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint against Representative Jason Chaffetz on Monday morning with the Office of Congressional Ethics for his role in releasing information provided to him by FBI Director James Comey. 
‚ÄúRepresentative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clinton‚Äôs emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been.

Director Comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with Department of Justic e accusing him of violating the Hatch Act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election.

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
CNN has obtained brand new audio of North Carolina Republican Senator Richard Burr joking about gun owners putting a ‚Äúbullseye‚Äù on Hillary Clinton. 
The despicable comments come as Burr faces a close Senate race against Democratic opponent Deborah Ross. Both candidates are within a point of each other, according to RealClearPolitics. 
More of the CNN report : 
The North Carolina Republican, locked in a tight race for reelection, quipped that as he walked into a gun shop ‚Äúnothing made me feel better‚Äù than seeing a magazine about rifles ‚Äúwith a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI was a little bit shocked at that ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt have a bullseye on it,‚Äù he said Saturday to GOP volunteers, prompting laughter from the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. ‚ÄúBut on the bottom right (of the magazine), it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, there‚Äôs an army of support out there right now for our candidates.‚Äù 
This type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to Republican leaders in 2016. As the campaign has gone on, the hateful and violent rhetoric, particularly from the man at the top of the Republican ticket, has become increasingly worse. 
At one point this year, Donald Trump suggested that ‚ÄúSecond Amendment people‚Äù should take up arms against Clinton if she nominates a Supreme Court justices they don‚Äôt like. He also said that he‚Äôd like to ‚Äúsee what happens‚Äù if the Democratic nominee‚Äôs bodyguards were disarmed. 
As CNN notes, Trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language ‚Äì or anything he‚Äôs ever said or done ‚Äì but Burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed, although it does not excuse what he said. 
‚ÄúThe comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it,‚Äù the Republican senator said, according to CNN. 
This type of imagery has no place in our politics, regardless of whether it‚Äôs being said in public or private, especially given the heightened level of anger and hatred toward Hillary Clinton from Trump supporters. 
Whether it‚Äôs Trump or Burr, voters should remember their irresponsible language when they go to vote in just one week.";english;2016-11-01T02:04:28.309+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Explosive Audio Surfaces Of GOP Senator Joking About Gun Owners Shooting Clinton;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-22-at-3.19.47-PM.png;0;1;492;0;492;bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
A new report is painting CIA Director James Comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as Comey sent a letter about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, but refused to call out Russia for meddling in the election by hacking Democrats. 
CNBC reported : FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI‚Äôs name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former FBI official tells CNBC. 
‚Ä¶. 
According to the former official, Comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to: ‚ÄúA foreign power was trying to undermine the election. He believed it to be true, but was against putting it out before the election.‚Äù Comey‚Äôs position, this official said, was ‚Äúif it is said, it shouldn‚Äôt come from the FBI, which as you‚Äôll recall it did not.‚Äù 
Director Comey didn‚Äôt want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, but he had no qualms about sending a letter to Congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election. 
With each new revelation and detail, it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that FBI Director Comey may have violated the Hatch Act with his letter to Congress. It is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections. 
When the information was bad for Donald Trump, Comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election. However, he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. 
It is becoming clear that Comey has abused his power and must be removed as FBI Director immediately.";english;2016-11-01T02:04:36.373+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Comey Bias Exposed As FBI Boss Refused To Call Out Russians For Hacking Before Election;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-07-07T163623Z_1_LYNXNPEC6616G_RTROPTP_4_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON-COMEY.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran GOP strategist, who has advised candidates from 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. The Trump campaign‚Äôs latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly $767,000 that Fabrizio‚Äôs firm says it is still owed for polling. 
Trump‚Äôs decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given Trump‚Äôs history of not paying for services performed; it won‚Äôt be the last. It is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs mentality has always been to put himself first. Paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for Trump. His businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades, so it isn‚Äôt surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign. 
Anybody who works for the Trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because Donald Trump‚Äôs version of making America great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket.

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
While the media continues to focus on what is increasingly becoming a non-story ‚Äì FBI Director James Comey‚Äôs vague letter regarding more emails related to Hillary Clinton ‚Äì news about Donald Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia continues to gain steam. 
Not only did NBC just report that the FBI is now in the preliminary stages of investigating Trump‚Äôs ex-campaign manager‚Äôs connection to Russia, but Slate also reported on Monday that a Trump server may have repeatedly been communicating with a Russian bank. 
Slate claims that while a group of computer scientists was looking into the Russian cyber attack of the DNC, they stumbled onto something unexpectedly. 
The report: 
In late July, one of these scientists‚Äîwho asked to be referred to as Tea Leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their data‚Äîfound what looked like malware emanating from Russia. The destination domain had Trump in its name, which of course attracted Tea Leaves‚Äô attention. But his discovery of the data was pure happenstance‚Äîa surprising needle in a large haystack of DNS lookups on his screen. ‚ÄúI have an outlier here that connects to Russia in a strange way,‚Äù he wrote in his notes. He couldn‚Äôt quite figure it out at first. But what he saw was a bank in Moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue. 
More data was needed, so he began carefully keeping logs of the Trump server‚Äôs DNS activity. As he collected the logs, he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world. Six of them began scrutinizing them for clues. 
The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasn‚Äôt the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation‚Äîconversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn‚Äôt an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank. 
This news doesn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, all while taking pro-Russia positions throughout the campaign that come straight off a Kremlin wishlist. 
The Clinton campaign was quick to jump on the report in a statement by Clinton Senior Policy Adviser Jake Sullivan: 
This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia. It certainly seems the Trump Organization felt it had something to hide, given that it apparently took steps to conceal the link when it was discovered by journalists. 
This line of communication may help explain Trump‚Äôs bizarre adoration of Vladimir Putin and endorsement of so many pro-Kremlin positions throughout this campaign. It raises even more troubling questions in light of Russia‚Äôs masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russia‚Äôs meddling in our elections. 
Trump‚Äôs pro-Russia rhetoric and policy positions are not a coincidence. The more information that comes out, the clearer it is that the Republican nominee has connections to Russia that he is hiding from voters. 
With just a week until Election Day, this is the explosive story the media should be focusing on. It‚Äôs critical that the American people know what kind of financial ties a potential president has with an American adversary, especially when that adversary is Russia.";english;2016-11-01T02:56:53.827+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;New Report Uncovers Secret Trump Server That Repeatedly Communicated With Russia;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/24877259689_02fabb19c9_b.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

While Donald Trump has repeatedly said he took advantage of loopholes that allowed him to legally pay nothing in federal income taxes for decades, the New York Times reported on Monday that Trump may have actually crossed a legal boundary to avoid paying his fair share. 
According to the Times, the Republican nominee used a ‚Äútax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.‚Äù 
The report: 
Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump‚Äôs tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. ‚ÄúWhatever loophole existed was not ‚Äòexploited‚Äô here, but stretched beyond any recognition,‚Äù said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s. 
Moreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other people‚Äôs money ‚Äî in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City. 
The reason that Trump bent over backward ‚Äì and potentially broke laws ‚Äì to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to ‚Äústave off financial ruin.‚Äù 
This is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù business background. 
Yet, he calls himself the ‚Äúking of debt.‚Äù His businesses have declared bankruptcy six times. He has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes. He lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business. Reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to Russia. 
All of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background. 
Even as all of this information is out there, American voters still know very little about Donald Trump‚Äôs finances because he has refused to be transparent about them. 
And consider this: What Trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting. If it weren‚Äôt, he would have already released them. 
The latest New York Times story is just the latest installment of Trump‚Äôs shady business background.

Republicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù. 
The United States District Court in New Jersey ordered discovery on Donald Trump and the RNC‚Äôs poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on November 4th, just days before the November 8th election. 
The order demands affidavits from several parties, including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendant‚Äôs (RNC‚Äôs) efforts with the Trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country, ‚Äúas indicated by Kellyanne Conway‚Äù. 
Affidavits are also demanded from several Republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide ‚Äúvoter fraud‚Äù monitoring and poll monitoring, such as RNC member Rob Gleason‚Äôs efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and RNC member Ronna Romney McDaniel‚Äôs efforts in Michigan to prepare a ‚Äúmassive, statewide anti-voter fraud effort‚Äù. 
The RNC must also answer for Governor Mike Pence‚Äôs comments that the Trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure ‚Äúballot integrity‚Äù. 
This is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante. 
Rick Hasen at Election Law Blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad, ‚ÄúPretty broad discovery required in short order, with hearing on November 4.‚Äù 
However, ‚ÄúThe judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the DNC given the time frame, but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes.‚Äù 
The DNC filed a lawsuit against the Republican National Committee for violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over Donald Trump‚Äôs claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own (often in ‚Äúurban‚Äù areas) to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isn‚Äôt likely to stand for it. 
So now discovery has been court-ordered, which is just more bad news for Republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the White House. 
It‚Äôs exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote. Everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation. Don‚Äôt let anyone dissuade you from voting.

We looked yesterday at Kurt Eichenwald‚Äôs revelation that Donald Trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails. That is hardly Trump‚Äôs only misdeed, but how many people realize that Donald Trump, at this moment, has 75 ‚Äì SEVENTY-FIVE ‚Äì legal issues hanging over his head. 
He‚Äôs lying 20 to 35 times a day and has his followers ‚Äì and with much less excuse, the mainstream media ‚Äì thoroughly distracted by the Clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities. 
USA TODAY reported at the end of October that ‚ÄúJust two weeks before Election Day, at least 75 of the 4,000-plus lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by USA TODAY.‚Äù 
It will surprise no one, because Trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster , that ‚ÄúOne Trump case, over non-payment of tips to caterers at Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City, is scheduled to go to trial a week before Election Day.‚Äù 
If one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that Trump does not pay his bills. Earlier, we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a Florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts, having decided that the contractor had been ‚Äúpaid enough,‚Äù even though it wasn‚Äôt the agreed-upon amount. Trump got nailed by the court for $300K in attorney‚Äôs fees in that case. 
Just a few examples from USA TODAY‚Äôs investigation: 
Trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses: angry members at his Jupiter, Fla. golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment. There‚Äôs a fraud case brought by Trump University students who say the mogul‚Äôs company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course. Trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign. A disgruntled GOP political consultant sued for $4 million saying Trump defamed her. Another suit, a class action, says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages. 
As pointed out by USA TODAY‚Äôs Nick Penzenstadler and John Kelly, these lawsuits will dog Trump into the White House, should he win. He will have no immunity because he is president. And America ‚Äì and the world ‚Äì will be treated to the spectacle of the President of the United States having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs. 
There are harassment cases, sex discrimination lawsuits, fraud, unpaid bills, racist comments, defamation, cases involving Trump University. As USA TODAY notes, ‚Äúas recently as last spring‚Ä¶New York had to take legal action to collect $8,578 in unpaid taxes on the Trump-owned company that owns the trademark Boeing 757 that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country.‚Äù 
And those 75 cases will likely grow. 
Trump has promised, after all, to sue The New York Times and each of the women ‚Äì NYMag maintains an exhaustive list ‚Äì who have accused him of sexual assault. 
USA Today says it spent six months researching court records. ‚ÄúThe exclusive analysis,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúfound an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate, ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits. The cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the White House.‚Äù 
Donald Trump claims Clinton is tainted. He claims Clinton‚Äôs emails are bigger than Watergate. The other day tweeted , ‚ÄúWe must not let #CrookedHillary take her CRIMINAL SCHEME into the Oval Office. #DrainTheSwamp.‚Äù 
This comes from the man who would turn the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue into a morality No-Go Zone. 
All the facts ‚Äì including the new disclosures about Trump‚Äôs ties to a Russian server and his potentially illegal ploy to avoid paying taxes ‚Äì make it clear that if Trump the deadbeat liar drains the swamp, he will be the first one down the drain.";english;2016-11-01T14:12:25.988+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Mainstream Media Ignoring 75 Lawsuits Against Trump to Focus on Clinton Emails;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/trump-angry.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Some Americans are likely aware of the psychological term ‚Äúprojecting‚Äù that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else; as an ‚Äòunconscious‚Äô form of transferring guilt for one‚Äôs own actions. As soon as the Republican primaries concluded, Donald Trump projected Republicans‚Äô guilt for election rigging, either through vote obstruction or suppression, onto Democrats and his opponent Hillary Clinton. Republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of Barack Obama in 2008, and they have only ramped up their ‚Äò election rigging‚Äô activities over the past eight years; and yet Trump accuses Democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath. 
Yesterday, the North Carolina conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed a lawsuit against North Carolina Republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the ‚Äú coordinated effort to suppress the Black vote in the state .‚Äù What the NAACP rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was ‚Äú right out of the GOP [election rigging] playbook to suppress the Black vote in the state. ‚Äù 
The election rigging amounts to three counties in North Carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of, mostly African American, Democratic residents a week before the presidential election. The lawsuit charged election officials in Beaufort, Moore, and Cumberland counties of denying primarily African American voters‚Äô eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were ‚Äú bounced back as undeliverable. ‚Äù 
Most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging, such as James Edward Arthur Sr. had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots. Many of the purged voters lived at their ‚Äú original registration address ‚Äù and were victims of a ‚Äú simple postal service error. ‚Äù 
Mr. Arthur is an African American who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last 14 elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue. Arthur testified that he, like thousands of other African American Democratic voters, never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied, or that if he didn‚Äôt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy. Mr. Arthur said, 
‚Äú If I knew my right to vote was in jeopardy, I would do whatever I could to protect it. I want and plan to vote in the upcoming election, but I am concerned that since my registration has been canceled I will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted .‚Äù 
It is what any sane human being would consider ‚Äú election rigging ‚Äù simply because the tri-county ploy targeted primarily African Americans who typically vote for Democrats. It is also something North Carolina Republicans have been guilty of for the past six years. 
According to the NAACP lawsuit, North Carolina Republicans are in violation of the National Voter Registration Act which ‚Äú bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final 90 days before an election .‚Äù Republican election officials State officials defended their ‚Äú election rigging ‚Äù and said they were justified in ‚Äú purging tens-of-thousands ‚Äù of mainly African American Democratic voters‚Äô eligibility, the definition of systemic, on an individual basis. 
However, the NAACP also accused Republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly African American voters‚Äô eligibility who did not receive the mailing. One Republican who ran for a local office last year, Shane Hubers, challenged the registration of voters,‚Ääthe majority who are them Democrats, ‚Ääin Beaufort County. 
In one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit, Cumberland County, one ‚Äú individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of 3,951 mostly Democratic voters .‚Äù In Moore County, the secretary of the local Republican Party, N. Carol Wheeldon, challenged approximately 400 mainly African American registered voters; likely because they do not vote for Republicans. 
The lead attorney for the NAACP‚Äôs lawsuit, Penda Hair, said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted Republican ‚Äú election rigging ‚Äù conspiracy; 
‚Äú We know that in two of the counties, the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local Republican Party. We also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties .‚Äù Ms. Hair also noted that, ‚Äú in Moore County the return address of a right-wing group called the Voter Integrity Project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters. This is a very pernicious treatment of voters ,‚Äù she said. It is also a deliberate act of ‚Äú election rigging ‚Äù by Republicans. 
The president of the North Carolina NAACP, Reverend Dr. William Barber said, 
‚Äú We are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in North Carolina that we‚Äôve seen since the days of Jim Crow. The Tar Heel state is ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters. These attempts are a direct affront to our Constitution .‚Äù 
The NAACP lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since 2012 using this ‚Äúelection rigging ‚Äù process back on the rolls immediately. The organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters, and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on Election Day. They have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case. 
It might be the case that the NAACP‚Äôs request for a hearing may be granted; especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that North Carolina Republicans violated the National Voter Registration Act in yet another manner; failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a DMV office over the past few years. 
Last Thursday U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs ordered North Carolina Republicans to permit those tens-of-thousands of voters to cast provisional ballots. It is highly doubtful that North Carolina Republicans will obey the Federal Judge‚Äôs orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their ‚Äúelection rigging‚Äù actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the Republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters. 
Republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the American people first elected Barack Obama as President, and the conservatives on the Supreme Court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with Republicans to suppress, or obstruct, the voting rights of primarily people of color because they don‚Äôt support Republicans. To be perfectly clear, it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression, obstruction, or disenfranchisement; it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections. And it is only Republicans and the Koch brothers‚Äô outfit the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), who are behind each and every attempt in Republican-controlled states to kill democracy by doing what the Republican Party standard bearer Donald Trump is guilty of projecting; rig elections.";english;2016-11-01T16:06:37.902+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;North Carolina Republicans Sued For Rigging the Election For Trump;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/women-voting.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Rachel Maddow traces the history of the post-Civil War ‚ÄúEnforcement Acts‚Äù signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, including the Ku Klux Klan Act , or The Enforcement Act of 1871 (17 Stat. 13), which still makes it illegal to conspire to intimidate voters. 
To show that the Klan Act is not ‚Äúvestigial‚Äù but very much relevant in this election, Maddow points to the citation of this law by the Democrat Party in a ‚Äúwhole raft of lawsuits‚Äù in Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Ohio alleging voter intimidation. 
Maddow points out that though voter intimidation is illegal anyway, the significance of the Klan Act is that it prohibits ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù to ‚Äúprevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice President, or as a member of Congress of the United States.‚Äù 
As an example of the role the KKK plays in Trump‚Äôs campaign, Maddow produced the KKK‚Äôs newspaper of today, which bills itself as ‚ÄúThe Political Voice of White Christian America,‚Äù which, you might note, is identical with Fox News demographic. This paper, she says, ‚Äúhas been turning up on front lawns in the great state of Georgia.‚Äù 
Watch courtesy of MSNBC (discussion begins at 9:15 mark): 
Tonight we just got a hold of this disgusting development. This is the newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan today. It‚Äôs The Crusader, the political voice of white Christian America. The premier voice of white resistance. They‚Äôve got ‚Äî you see the white power symbol there in the upper right-hand corner? They‚Äôve got a whole media operation going on apparently. Watch white pride TV, listen to KKK radio 24 hours a day. This newsletter is about 12 pages long, features articles on ‚Äúthe threat of nonwhite immigration,‚Äù a very subtle feature on black people committing terrible crimes against white people. There‚Äôs an article by the founder of the America First Party which is all about the terrorist Jews. He brags in his byline that he‚Äôs the man who David Duke credits for awakening him to the threat of Jewish supremacism. It‚Äôs exactly what you would think from the Ku Klux Klan newspaper. If you knew there was a Ku Klux Klan newspaper these days. But the front page full page story is ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù with a big featured center photo of Donald Trump. It‚Äôs one of several articles in the paper about Trump, including this in-set article about how Trump‚Äôs candidacy is ‚Äúmoving the dialogue forward.‚Äù [‚Ä¶] Those are a couple of the many, many robocalls that were made during the Republican primary campaign on behalf of Donald Trump‚Äôs candidacy, calls made by a white nationalist group that calls itself the American National Super PAC. The Trump campaign doesn‚Äôt appear to have anything to do with these calls. They reportedly returned a donation from the white nationalist guy who you hear on the call when it was first reported that he was making these calls and that he was a Trump donor. It was further embarrassing to the Trump campaign when this guy, this farmer and white nationalist who does these robocalls, he was initially picked to be a Trump delegate to the Republican Convention this year before his delegate status once got yanked once it was widely reported. 
Donald Trump‚Äôs white supremacist followers have made no secret of the fact that they want a ‚ÄúWhite homeland‚Äù and that, of necessity, the United States must be this White homeland. As Maddow has pointed out in the past, and by their own admission, their ‚Äúeugenics insanity‚Äù is now out in the open because of Donald Trump. 
Don‚Äôt believe Maddow? Demographics Pro looked at ‚Äú10,000 Donald Trump Twitter supporters [and] found that more than one third follow white nationalist Twitter accounts.‚Äù 
The fact is, Trump has mainstreamed white supremacy and by not strongly denouncing it, brought it into his own ‚Äúmovement,‚Äù which seems to be a meeting place for much more than disaffected white working-class Americans, whatever the mainstream media tells you.

Gallup released their presidential leadership survey, and the results were historically bad for Donald Trump: 
Voters rate Trump worse than any other presidential candidate in Gallup‚Äôs records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have. Previous readings were taken in late October in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 campaigns. In those years, between 52% and 61% of registered voters said the two major-party candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities ‚Äî a sharp contrast to Trump‚Äôs current 32%. Clinton‚Äôs rating of 51% is one percentage point below the previous low score. 
Clinton‚Äôs score, while low, was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to 2000. Trump‚Äôs score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll. 
Voters aren‚Äôt going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership. The popular vote total in 2016 may reflect the nation‚Äôs political polarization, but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the Democratic candidate. 
Donald Trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate. He doesn‚Äôt look, act, or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the Oval Office and lead the United States of America. 
The last week before election day tension that is in the air is normal, but the fundamental motivating factors of this contest haven‚Äôt changed. Democrats are holding on to their electoral map advantage, while Donald Trump has become the central issue and question on the ballot.

A ‚Äúveteran‚Äù spy is alleging that Russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting Donald Trump and has been for at least five years. The spy said the response from the FBI was ‚Äúshock and horror.‚Äù 
The report alleges that Trump and his ‚Äúinner circle‚Äù have accepted a regular ‚Äúflow of intelligence from the Kremlin and that Russian intelligence claims to have ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù Trump on his visits and could ‚Äúblackmail him‚Äù. 
David Corn at Mother Jones reported: 
Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer‚Äôs conversations with Russian sources, noted, ‚ÄúRussian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.‚Äù It maintained that Trump ‚Äúand his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.‚Äù It claimed that Russian intelligence had ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù Trump during his visits to Moscow and could ‚Äúblackmail him.‚Äù It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on ‚Äúbugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.‚Äù 
The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was ‚Äúshock and horror.‚Äù The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos‚Äîsome of which referred to members of Trump‚Äôs inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,‚Äù he says. 
In August, Corn reports, the FBI asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he ‚Äúcontinued to share information with the FBI‚Äù which he says made it clear there was a ‚Äúpretty substantial inquiry going on.‚Äù 
If this report is accurate, the spy‚Äôs information confirms what Senator Harry Reid says intelligence experts and FBI Director James Comey already shared with him regarding ‚Äúexplosive information‚Äù regarding ties and coordination between Donald Trump and Russia. 
This report also rings true given report about the Trump server repeatedly being connected to Russia, including Trump‚Äôs server possibly communicating with a Russian bank. 
It also makes sense given the many ties to Russia within Trump‚Äôs own campaign and indeed Trump‚Äôs own rhetoric regarding NATO and Russia. Trump changed the Republican Party platform‚Äôs pro-Ukraine proposals and talked about weakening NATO, both of which mirrored Putin‚Äôs wish list. NBC reported Monday evening that the FBI is in the preliminary stages of investigating Trump‚Äôs ex-campaign manager‚Äôs connection to Russia. 
Donald Trump has already been busted for reading Russian propaganda at his rallies, as Newsweek‚Äôs Kurt Eichenwald uncovered an instance of Trump reading propaganda directly from Putin at a rally in Pennsylvania. 
Eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the Russians have been hacking into American emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election, ‚ÄúThe Russians have been obtaining American emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of them‚Äîfalsifying them‚Äîin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election. The big question, of course, is why are the Russians working so hard to damage Clinton and, in the process, aid Donald Trump?‚Äù 
The answer to why Putin is trying so hard to defeat Clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her. Unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is no pushover. According to former U.S. officials, Putin sees Clinton as a ‚Äúforceful proponent of ‚Äòregime change‚Äô policies that the Russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival.‚Äù 
Trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the Kremlin. He‚Äôs been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy, he is easily flattered and easily manipulated. It‚Äôs also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him ‚Äì see the Billy Bush bus tape of Trump bragging about sexual assault. Trump is easy bait. 
The fact that the FBI Director felt compelled to announce something about Hillary‚Äôs emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aide‚Äôs emails and even then he wasn‚Äôt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates, but he chose to keep this explosive information about Donald Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia under wraps is very disturbing. 
This isn‚Äôt a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the FBI follows about ongoing investigations. This is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate. But the fact that they come from different sources and that Trump willingly staffed his own campaign with Russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak ‚Äî these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions.";english;2016-11-01T17:55:04.779+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;FBI Horrified As Spy Says Russia Has Been Supporting And Cultivating Trump For Years;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016-10-15T180331Z_2_LYNXMPEC9E0FO_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Russia did hack the Democrats. So all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the U.S. election. 
But FBI Director James Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as ‚Äúpartisan‚Äù. 
Republican FBI Director James Comey advised the Obama administration not to publicly accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and more ‚Äúon the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the Nov. 8 election,‚Äù officials ‚Äúfamiliar with the deliberations‚Äù told the Washington Post. 
These sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity. 
There are a few reasons why Comey might want to keep his agency‚Äôs investigation of Russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be re-opening its exhaustive investigation of Clinton‚Äôs emails, which resulted from a Republican-led, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless Benghazi investigation that also cleared Clinton, it seems odd that Comey was going to stay silent on the Russia matter. 
Comey‚Äôs decisions is especially odd given the reports that the Russians have been communicating and coordinating with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the point that he is already ‚Äúcompromised.‚Äù 
Only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the United States president. 
The same sources tell the Post that Comey made the decision to reveal the Clinton emails to Congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. 
Not sure I‚Äôm buying that because if Comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldn‚Äôt have said anything at all, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that his motives were nefarious. 
There might well be good reason for this ‚Äì after all, this is the FBI and they can‚Äôt tell us everything, but as of right now Comey has mishandled this `and appears to be trying to influence an election to help Republicans. Just because he is a Republican and just because he has donated to Republicans doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt doing his job properly. 
But Comey has a lot of explaining to do right now. He is under fire for good reason, as the explanations he‚Äôs giving for these decisions don‚Äôt make sense and are contradictory.";english;2016-11-01T19:36:08.681+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Comey Must Explain Why He Advised Obama Not to Publicly Accuse Russia of Hacking Democrats;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PutinRussian-President-Vladimir-Putin-attends-an-awarding-ceremony-at-the-Kremlin-in-Moscow-Russia.png;0;1;0;0;0;bias

James Comey‚Äôs interference in the presidential election has motivated Clinton supporters to work harder, give more money, and get to the polls, which in not what Republicans wanted at all. 
Democrats have seen through Comey‚Äôs letter and the Republican spin. The October surprise has failed. Instead, it has made Hillary Clinton even stronger while giving her campaign more resources to use to close out the presidential election. 
As a political tactic, the Comey letter is harming Republicans. 
Republicans have thrown everything that they can think of at Hillary Clinton, and nothing has stopped her. Hillary Clinton and her supporters continue to grow stronger, while Donald Trump is marching back into reality television star C-list celebrity obscurity.";english;2016-11-01T20:41:22.161+02:00;politicususa.com;US;4617.0;Comey Letter Hurts GOP As Hillary Clinton Raised $11.3 Million Online In 72 Hours;0.0;http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/clinton-arms-up-win.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

370 of nation‚Äôs top economists have come together to urge the American people not to elect Donald Trump to be the next President Of The United States. 
In the letter , the economists listed a dozen economic policy reasons why voters should not vote for Trump, but it as their conclusion that was stunning, ‚ÄúHe promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.Donald Trump is a dangerous, destructive choice for the country. He misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality. If elected, he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of the country. For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you do not vote for Donald Trump.‚Äù 
Trump‚Äôs thoughts on the economy are dangerous to the prosperity of the country. It isn‚Äôt just that Trump is a person of bad character who lacks any of the human traits that voters should seek in a president. It is also that his policies are nonsense. 
Economists don‚Äôt write these types of letters ever. The economists aren‚Äôt discussing partisan politics. They view Trump and his ideas as a threat to the American economy.

Donald Trump‚Äôs deputy campaign manager, the Clinton-obsessed Republican operative, David Bossie, told ABC News‚Äô George Stephanopoulos this morning that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an enthusiasm gap‚Äù and that this bit of math Republicans do is Trump‚Äôs path to victory on November 8. 
This is how the conversation went, per CBS News‚Äô Sopan Deb , as always highlighting the important bits: 
Stephanopoulos was not about to let Bossie get away with the claim about Trump‚Äôs tax returns, and hammered him on the issue: ""He's going to release [his tax return] when he is not under audit.""‚Äì David Bossie, Trump Deputy Campaign Manager https://t.co/Y9xVg0rJIX 
‚Äî Good Morning America (@GMA) November 1, 2016 
Bossie deflected like a pro. You can see why Trump hired him. 
As a corollary to Bossie‚Äôs claims, Trump suddenly found himself interested in polls again this morning, tweeting , Wow, now leading in @ABC / @washingtonpost Poll 46 to 45. Gone up 12 points in two weeks, mostly before the Crooked Hillary blow-up! 
‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2016 
The Trump campaign has always been about making much out of nothing; elections are not rigged if Trump gets his way, and neither are polls if Trump is leading. Otherwise, it‚Äôs all left-wing shenanigans. 
However, even Newt Gingrich isn‚Äôt buying the new poll: Washington Post-ABC poll is an absurdity. Trump has not moved up 13 points in the last 8 days.he was NEVER 12 points behind. Ignore polls 
‚Äî Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 1, 2016 
And what Trump fails to mention is that his lead disappears if Johnson and Stein are taken out of the mix: then Clinton leads by +1 . 
These latest claims are an absolute sham as Clinton leads overwhelmingly in early voting and Comey‚Äôs email gambit seems to have failed to sway voters to Trump‚Äôs camp. 
Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs own legal problems are beginning to overwhelm the narrative , and if there is any evidence of a Clinton enthusiasm gap it exists only in Bossie‚Äôs own head.

The more things change, the more they stay the same. The House Freedom Caucus is planning a secret meeting, which in typical Republican fashion was leaked to the press, to discuss ousting Paul Ryan and demanding more ransom from GOP leadership. 
Politico reported , ‚ÄúOne of the most pressing questions preoccupying Washington is what the group will do about Paul Ryan. The Wisconsin Republican has said he intends to seek another term as House speaker but has rankled members of the group of several dozen Republican lawmakers that drove John Boehner out of the Speakership last year. The Freedom Caucus is also weighing proposals meant to empower its members, some at the expense of GOP leadership‚Äôs authority.‚Äù 
There have been early rumblings that Speaker Ryan may be open to making a few deals on policies like tax reform with Hillary Clinton if she wins the election. One of the reasons why these deals may never happen is because of the ability of far right Republicans to cause trouble. 
If Ryan‚Äôs Republican majority shrinks, he will be an even bigger hostage to the far-right wing of his caucus. The dysfunctional dynamic in the House is going to continue even if Hillary Clinton wins the election. Ryan has run into the same hurdles that John Boehner faced. House Republicans are deeply divided and unable to agree on much of anything. 
The fact that the Freedom Caucus is holding a secret meeting is a sign that nothing is going to change. If Paul Ryan doesn‚Äôt cave to their demands, they will force Ryan out of the Speaker position. 
A group of House Republicans is plotting new ways to keep the House from working properly before a new president has even been elected.

The Republican nominee begged Clinton voters to change their vote in 6 states where it‚Äôs not too late to do so. Trump wrote Wednesday morning, ‚ÄúSo now that you can see Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICAN GREAT AGAIN!‚Äù You can change your vote in six states. So, now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tuesday evening Trump made the case that due to the FBI‚Äôs announcement about Clinton‚Äôs emails voters might have buyers‚Äô remorse , ‚ÄúA lot of things have happened over the last few days. This is a message for any Democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton and are having a bad case of buyers‚Äô remorse ‚Äî in other words you want to change your vote ‚Äî Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you‚Äôve made a mistake.‚Äù 
While it‚Äôs true that people in some states can change their votes, it‚Äôs not true that this rule was changed because of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúemails‚Äù and yes, that‚Äôs a new Right wing ‚Äúthing‚Äù apparently. Trump doesn‚Äôt suggest the law was changed because of Clinton, but he seems to think people will be rushing to change their mind about Clinton because of the non-surprise October ‚Äúsurprise!‚Äù the Republican FBI Director delivered , which was perceived to have benefited the Trump ticket. 
Days ago, Snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the FBI‚Äôs bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to Clinton. 
Claim: After FBI Director Jim Comey announced that he was reviewing e-mails potentially linked to Hillary Clinton, several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes. mixture 
WHAT‚ÄôS TRUE: Some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day. 
WHAT‚ÄôS FALSE: No states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for Hillary Clinton to change their votes. 
And to make this even better, that false information was based on a Fox News report that wasn‚Äôt selling the false story about Clinton, but still got some of the information wrong. This is why the Right can‚Äôt have nice things. The Left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular, because epistemic closure leads to losing. 
Trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping, exhaustive list of lawsuits, bragging about sexual assault, dissing minorities and a Gold Star family, and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaign‚Äôs ties to Russia. 
Only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a Clinton aide‚Äôs emails when they don‚Äôt even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet.

Speaking at Reverend Samuel Delevoe Memorial Park in Fort Lauderdale, Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton was interrupted by a Donald Trump supporter who shouted: ‚ÄúBill Clinton is a rapist!‚Äù He was no doubt working for the $5,000 reward offered by InfoWars. But Clinton was having none of it. Rather than ignoring the man, she issued a stern rebuke. Stabbing her finger at the man, she said: 
‚ÄúYou know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support Donald Trump.‚Äù 
The man continued to shout, waving his sign, and the crowd countered with cries of ‚ÄúHillary! Hillary!‚Äù as she said, 
‚ÄúIt is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, we‚Äôre going forward into a brighter future.‚Äù 
The protester was escorted out by security, and Clinton told the man, and everyone like him, ‚ÄúYou may be angry about something, but anger is not a plan. Don‚Äôt be used. Don‚Äôt be exploited.‚Äù 
See the protester‚Äôs antics here. Note that he was neither roughed up nor attacked by Clinton supporters: 
Sadly, all too many angry white Christians are allowing themselves to be exploited by Donald Trump, who represents the very forces that have deprived them of the American dream, a man whom, as Clinton says, has taken everything, and given nothing. 
Last night, in Florida, Hillary Clinton was taking nothing, and giving everything.

Tens of thousands of pro and anti-government protesters have gathered on the streets of Venezuela's capital Caracas. 
During Wednesday‚Äôs mass rallies, in which over 20 people were injured and 39 were detained, the opponents accused President Nicolas Maduro of violating the constitutional order and blocking a recall referendum aimed at removing him from power. 
They also called for his immediate resignation. Opposition supporters take part in a rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro next to a poster of him in Caracas, Venezuela, October 26, 2016. (Photo by Reuters)

Meanwhile, large numbers of pro-government protesters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace in a show of support for Maduro. 
As the protests were being held, the president engaged in crisis security talks in reaction to the demonstrators‚Äô demands.

""They are desperate, they have received the order from the north to destroy the Venezuelan revolution,"" he added. 
On Tuesday, Maduro accused the opposition of attempting a ‚Äúparliamentary coup‚Äù by voting to launch an impeachment process against him.

Lebanon‚Äôs Minister of Foreign Affairs Gebran Bassil says the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah shares the victory of Michel Aoun in securing the country‚Äôs presidency. 
Aoun, a strong Hezbollah ally, was chosen by Lebanese lawmakers as the country‚Äôs president on Monday. 
Addressing a large number of people who had converged at a square in Beirut to celebrate Aoun‚Äôs election, Bassil, who is also the head of the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) and Aoun‚Äôs son-in-law, said his movement never doubted Hezbollah‚Äôs ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù and ‚Äúhonesty.‚Äù Aoun is the founder of the FPM. 
He said Aoun‚Äôs victory was based on his own perseverance as well as the positions adopted by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who is Hezbollah‚Äôs secretary general. 
In a phone call on the same day, Nasrallah congratulated Aoun on his election as the head of the Lebanese state. This image, taken in the southern suburbs of Beirut on October 31, 2016, shows people celebrating the election of Michel Aoun as the new president of Lebanon. 
Nasrallah endorsed Aoun last week, advising Lebanese political factions to set aside their differences in order to fill the presidential void in the Arab country. 
Lebanon had been without a president for over two years amid political bickering in the parliament. 
After the election, Aoun vowed in a speech to the parliament that he would spare no effort in trying to bring about the liberation of Lebanese territories occupied by Israel. 
He said his top priority would be to strengthen the army in order for it to become capable of defending the country against all threats to its independence and sovereignty. 
Hezbollah has been defending Lebanon against Israeli aggression since the movement‚Äôs inception, including during a full-fledged Israeli war in 2006.

A US congressman has warned that American troops could be prosecuted for providing military support to the Saudi war on Yemen. 
Ted Lieu made the warning in a letter to US Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, saying the US government‚Äôs denial of target selection for Saudi airstrikes in Yemen does not excuse Washington from legal responsibilities. 
‚ÄúI find it deeply troubling that the US apparently has no advanced knowledge of what targets will be struck by jets that are refueled by US personnel with US tankers,‚Äù Lieu said in his letter. 
‚ÄúThe US would appear to be violating LOAC [laws of armed conflict] and international standards by engaging in such direct military operations if US personnel are not aware if targets are civilian or military, if the loss of life and property are disproportional, or if the operation is even militarily necessary,‚Äù he noted. A Yemeni boy walks past a mural depicting a US drone and reading: ""Why did you kill my family."" (Photo by AFP) 
Pointing to the 18-month involvement of the US in Saudi war on the Yemeni people, the Democratic congressman stressed that Washington had knowledge of a bombardment campaign hitting civilian targets, including schools and hospitals, multiple times. 
‚ÄúUS personnel are now at legal risk of being investigated and potentially prosecuted for committing war crimes. Under international law, a person can be found guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes. Under US law, a person can be found guilty for conspiring to commit war crimes,‚Äù Lieu wrote. 
The Pentagon has been providing logistic and surveillance support to Saudi Arabia in its military aggression against Yemen, the kingdom‚Äôs impoverished southern neighbor, which has killed more than 10,000 Yemenis since its onset in March 2015. 
The unprovoked war started by a coalition of Saudi-allies in an attempt to undermine the Houthi Ansarullah movement and reinstate former Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, a staunch ally of the Riyadh regime. 
Washington has on several occasions criticized the Saudi regime for its crimes against humanity in Yemen, but has shown no sign of ending its support for Riyadh.

In August, the US State Department approved the sale of more than 130 Abrams tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment worth about $1.15 billion to Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi-led bombardments have struck hospitals, markets and other places where civilians gather. 
In September, Amnesty International reported that a US manufactured bomb had been used in a Saudi strike against a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Yemen‚Äôs northwestern province of Hajjah which claimed the lives of 19 people. 
In October, more than 140 people lost their lives and over 525 others sustained injuries after Saudi military aircraft struck a hall in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a, where rows of people were attending a funeral.

The ongoing federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation was expected because of the Clinton family‚Äôs ties with US enemies, says Scott Bennett, a former US Army psychological warfare officer. 
The FBI has been probing possible pay-to-play schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is ‚Äúlikely‚Äù to press charges against it, Fox News reported Wednesday, citing informed officials. 
Bennett told Press TV on Friday that the probe was inevitable ‚Äúbecause of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the Clinton Foundation had, most specifically and grievously to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar,‚Äù and many other countries blacklisted by Washington. 
It was revealed on Friday that the Clinton Foundation took a $1 million gift from Qatar during Hillary Clinton‚Äôs tenure as the US secretary of state, without her informing the State Department. 
Hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction, despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state. 
According to the foundation‚Äôs website, Qatar has so far given the Clintons a total of between $1 million and $5 million over the years. 
Aside from Qatar, Saudi Arabia has also been one of the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs biggest donors. It became known in 2008 that the kingdom had given them between $10 million and $25 million. 
‚ÄúSo those terrorist entities, which have been labeled as the enemies of the United States, have been appearing as Clinton Foundation donors,‚Äù Bennett said. 
‚ÄúThat is a serious crime, it is treason, it is corruption, it is bribery of officials,‚Äù said the analyst. 
Bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the Clinton family were coming from ‚Äúthose personnel in the American government who have had enough.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThey have stepped up, they have released emails, they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to WikiLeaks,‚Äù he added. 
Whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks has released thousands of Hillary‚Äôs campaign chairman and top aide John Podesta‚Äôs emails since last month, exposing some of the well-kept secrets surrounding the Clinton family and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs bid for the White House. 
Bennett predicted that the case would ‚Äúmost probably‚Äù lead to indictments and some people would be arrested as early as this weekend. Loading ...

At least 47 people, including women and children, have been killed and over 110 others injured in a huge bomb explosion in Pakistan‚Äôs Balochistan province. 
The blast hit Shah Noorani shrine in Lasbela district on Saturday evening, Balochistan's Home Minister Sarfaraz Bugti said. 
The shrine is located about 100 kilometers north of the port city of Karachi. Staff members of a local hospital in Karachi wait for casualties of a bomb blast at Shah Noorani shrine in Balochistan province, Pakistan, November 12, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
The injured, he added, would be taken to hospitals in Lasbela, Khuzdar or Civil Hospital in Karachi as there are no medical centers available in the area. 
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif denounced the bomb attack, calling on authorities to speed up the rescue operation. 
Reports say some 500 people were in the shrine when the bomb went off. 
""Every day, around sunset, there is a dhamaal (a Sufi ritual dance) here, and there are large numbers of people who come for this,"" said Nawaz Ali, the shrine's custodian. 
The Daesh terror group has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack. 
Pakistani security officials are saying the terrorist attack was in response to the killing of Jundullah chief by Pakistani police which took place in the early hours of Friday morning. 
On October 24, Daesh also claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 60 people in an attack by its terrorists on a police college in Baluchistan‚Äôs provincial capital Quetta. It was one of the deadliest attacks on Pakistan's security forces in recent years. 
In August, Daesh claimed responsibility for another attack on a gathering of mourners at a hospital in Quetta, where 70 people were killed. The attack was also claimed by Pakistani Taliban faction Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. 
Pakistan‚Äôs restive and mineral-rich Balochistan province is rife with separatist, extremist and sectarian violence and has been the scene of several bomb and gun attacks over the past years.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs top advisers blame FBI Director James Comey for the Democrat‚Äôs bruising loss to President-elect Donald Trump. 
Navin Nayak, the head of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs opinion research division, sent an email to senior staffers Thursday, outlining ‚Äúearly signals‚Äù as to why the candidate lost the November 8 presidential election, POLITICO reported on Friday. 
‚ÄúWe believe that we lost this election in the last week,‚Äù said Nayak‚Äôs email, which was published by POLITICO. ‚Äú Comey‚Äôs letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters ‚Äî particularly in the suburbs.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe also think Comey‚Äôs 2nd letter, which was intended to absolve Sec. Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump‚Äôs turnout,‚Äù he continued. 
The letter also highlighted several other challenges the Clinton team faced throughout the campaign, including a desire for change after two terms by a Democratic president and the reluctance of some Americans to vote for a female candidate. Hillary Clinton makes a concession speech after being defeated by Donald Trump in New York on November 9, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Despite those challenges, Nayak said, Clinton was on course to win until the last week, when ‚Äúeverything changed"" and the momentum began to shift in favor of Trump. 
‚ÄúVoters who decided in the last week broke for Trump by a larger margin (42-47). These numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states,‚Äù he said. 
The FBI director angered Democrats late in October by announcing in a letter to Congress that the agency had uncovered new emails connected to the Clinton email investigation. 
Just over a week later, Comey notified Congress that Clinton would not face charges over the newly discovered messages. 
Nayak said Comey‚Äôs letters encouraged Trump supporters and depressed the turnout for Clinton on Election Day. 
‚ÄúThere is no question that a week from Election Day, Sec. Clinton was poised for a historic win. In the end, less than 110K votes out of tens of millions cast on Election Day made the difference in this race,‚Äù he wrote. 
‚ÄúIn the end,‚Äù Nayak concluded, ‚Äúlate breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome.‚Äù

The commander of US forces in Afghanistan has promised an investigation into the recent death of more than 30 Afghan civilians, including women and children, in an airstrike. 
General John Nicholson said Saturday that the airstrike on the village of Buz Kandahari, just outside the northern city of Kunduz on Thursday, would be probed. 
Three Taliban leaders were supposed to be targeted in the raid, but the forces met ‚Äúsignificant enemy fire from multiple locations"" and called for help from a US aircraft, which left 33 civilians, including 17 children, dead. 
""An initial investigation has determined that efforts near Kunduz on November 3 to defend Afghan National Defense and Security Forces likely resulted in civilian casualties,"" Nicholson said in a statement. ""We will work with our Afghan partners to investigate and determine the facts and we will work with the government of Afghanistan to provide assistance."" 
The targets were high-ranking elements of the Takfiri group that were supposed to be hit in their houses, according to Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri. 
""They weren't ordinary people who had gathered. They were leading fighting in Kunduz. They were the commanders of their military commission,"" Waziri said. 
Taliban militants were removed from power following the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan, but they have stepped up their activities in recent months, attempting to overrun several provinces. 
Afghan forces have been engaged in fierce clashes with Taliban to contain the ongoing insurgency across various parts of the violence-wrecked country. 
The rising violence in Afghanistan comes despite the presence of thousands of foreign troops in the country. Loading ...

A fleet of Russian warships has entered the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Syria amid speculations that Moscow and Damascus are about to launch a massive operation against terrorists in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. 
The commander of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov told state-owned Russia-1 television network on Saturday that the military vessels were positioned in the ‚Äúdesignated zone... in the eastern Mediterranean and are now jointly carrying out tasks, maneuvering to the west of the Syrian coast.‚Äù 
Captain 1st rank Sergei Artamonov added that fighter jets have already started taking off from the carrier‚Äôs deck to survey the conflict zone. 
‚ÄúFlights are being carried out from the deck... they are working on coordination with the shore port. The flights have been going on practically every day for the last four days,‚Äù the high-ranking Russian naval commander pointed out. 
The remarks came a day after Russia‚Äôs Interfax news agency reported that Russian MiG and Sukhoi warplanes routinely fly from the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier into the Syrian airspace to ‚Äúdetermine combat missions.‚Äù 
Meanwhile, the commander of the Pyotr Veliky nuclear-powered battle cruiser, Captain 1st rank Vladislav Malakhovsky, said on Saturday that no foreign aircraft dared to ‚Äúcome closer than 50 kilometers‚Äù away from the Russian fleet.

On November 4, Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich passed through the Bosphorus Strait in northwestern Turkey and arrived off the Syrian coast. 
Grigorovich is reportedly capable of launching land-attack Kalibr cruise missiles, which are equivalent to US Tomahawk ones and equipped with the latest high precision guidance systems. 
Russia has been bombing Daesh and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front, terror groups in Syria since September 30, 2015 at the official request of President Bashar al-Assad. 
Backed by Russia‚Äôs aerial campaign, the Syrian troops have retaken several militant-held areas in the Arab country.

The American people have ‚Äúrepudiated the foreign policy‚Äù of President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton which was ‚Äúa complete disgrace‚Äù for the United States, according to James Fetzer, an American scholar and political analyst. 
Professor Fetzer made the remarks in a phone interview with Press TV on Monday, days after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stunned the world by defeating the heavily-favored Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, in the November 8 election. 
During the election campaign, Trump repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders in order to resolve global problems, including the issue of Daesh terrorism, which he has blamed on the policies of the Obama administration. 
On the other hand, Clinton has shown eagerness to confront Russia and continue the interventionist policies US administrations have practiced since 9/11. 
Professor Fetzer said that ‚ÄúClinton was behind the massacre of Libya, the butchery of Benghazi, the transfer of weapons to ‚Äòrebels‚Äô in Syria.‚Äù 
More than five years after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has become a failed state, with the central government holding no sway over the country, and Africa‚Äôs wealthiest nation has become a haven for terrorist organizations. 
And since 2011, the United States and its allies have been sponsoring terrorists wreaking havoc in Syria. 
Professor Fetzer stated that Clinton was being advised by Israeli intelligence, telling her ""how to conduct American foreign policy. It was a complete disgrace.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe American people have repudiated the foreign policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton,‚Äù the scholar said. 
‚ÄúDonald Trump is going to restore a measure of sanity. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East. He is going to restore the reputation of the United States for integrity, and dealing with the international community,‚Äù he noted. 
‚ÄúHe respects Russia as should any president of the United States, where Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fell miserably short,‚Äù the analyst pointed out. 
‚ÄúI believe we are already seeing signs that the situation for the world community is going to vastly, dramatically improve, that the United States is going to conduct itself in accordance with international law, and restrain from regime change, and hopefully we will no longer be the greatest aggressor nation in the world,‚Äù Fetzer said in his concluding remarks.

The brightest moon in almost 69 years will be lighting up the night sky this week in a treat for star watchers around the globe. 
The phenomenon, known as the supermoon, will reach its zenith in Asia and the South Pacific on Monday night. 
It will then reach its most brightest mode in North America before dawn on Monday. 
Across the international dateline in New Zealand, it will reach its brightest after midnight on Tuesday local time. 
If skies are clear, the upcoming full moon will appear up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than usual, according to NASA. This image shows a near full moon in Aravica, Arizona, on October 13, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
The moon‚Äôs distance from Earth varies because it is in an egg-shaped, not circular, orbit around the planet. 
Since the moon‚Äôs orbit is elliptical, one side (perigee) is about 50,000 kilometers closer to Earth than the other (apogee). 
The word syzygy is the scientific term used for when the Earth, sun, and moon line up as the moon orbits Earth. 
When perigee-syzygy of the Earth-moon-sun system occurs and the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun, we get a perigee moon, which is more commonly known as supermoon. 
This coincidence already happened one time on October 16. 
On November 14 and December 14, it happens again, as the moon becomes full on the same day as perigee. On November 14, it becomes full within about two hours of perigee‚Äîarguably making it an extra -supermoon. 
The full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016 but also the closest full moon to date in the 21st century. 
The next time a full moon comes this close to Earth will be November 25, 2034. Loading ...

Thousands of Britons have signed a petition to express their outrage over Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs use of ¬£369 million in taxpayers' money to repair the Buckingham Palace. 
More than 94,000 people had signed the petition as of Sunday, two days after the government of Prime Minister Theresa May allowed the royal family to repair the palace with public funds. 
The UK Parliament should discuss the petition when it hits the 100,000 mark. 
On Friday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond granted the 90-year-old Queen a 66-percent rise in funding required for the palace‚Äôs refurbishment over the next 10 years. 
The money would be used to replace cables, pipes and boilers installed 60 years ago to prevent a ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù event that might destroy the palace, according to Master of the Queen‚Äôs Household Tony Johnstone-Burt. 
Petitioners argued that the royals should foot the massive bill themselves given the vast extent of their wealth. 
‚ÄúThe Crown and its estates should be made to fund its own renovations,‚Äù wrote Mark Johnson, who posted the petition. 
Protesters said the money could be used to mend the faltering National Health Service (NHS) or help families get more affordable homes amid a housing crisis.

‚ÄúIt is wholly unreasonable to cut the benefits of the sick and disabled, take away housing benefits from the poor, and then pay for this,‚Äù said one signatory of the petition. 
The anti-monarchy campaign group Republic also took issue with the announcement, denouncing it as a ‚Äúdisgrace.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhat's worse is this appalling increase is only a small part of the annual cost of the Royal family, which we put at ¬£334m,‚Äù said Graham Smith, a member of the group. 
Over the past years, the UK government has been generous towards the royal family despite cutting billions in public money. 
Under former treasury minister George Osborne, the Queen‚Äôs sovereign grant for 2016 was increased by 7 percent, bringing the total to ¬£42.9 million a year. Now the annual grant would be inflated by two-thirds, rising to ¬£76 million in 2017. 
The grant is financed by the profit coming from the royal family‚Äôs 350,000 acres of land across the UK. Loading ...

A car bomb has reportedly exploded south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, killing around 100 people, mostly Shia pilgrims. 
According to security sources, a truck loaded with explosives went off on Thursday at a gas station in the Shomali village in the suburbs of the city of al-Hilla, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of the capital Baghdad and around 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Karbala. 
Reports say most of the victims were Iranian nationals. The photo shows the site of a blast at a gas station near Hilla, south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, November 24, 2016. 
The incident occurred at a time when buses packed with Shia pilgrims were parked at the gas station. The people were returning from Arba‚Äôeen mourning rituals in the holy city of Karbala. 
‚ÄúAt least seven buses with pilgrims were inside the petrol station at the time,‚Äù an unnamed police lieutenant colonel told AFP. People carry away the bodies of victims from the site of a bomb attack near Hilla, Iraq, November 24, 2016. 
AFP also quoted an unnamed police intelligence source as saying that ‚Äúthose buses were loaded with Iranians, Bahrainis and Iraqis. Ambulances and civil defense are on their way to the site.‚Äù 
The Takfiri Daesh terrorist group claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing. 
In recent weeks, Daesh has resorted to similar acts of violence in areas outside its control in a desperate attempt to undermine a large Iraqi battle aimed at liberating the northern city of Mosul, the terror group‚Äôs last remaining foothold in the country. 
‚ÄòIran won‚Äôt waver in backing Iraq‚Äô 
Hours after the incident, Iran‚Äôs Foreign Ministry spokesman strongly condemned the fatal terrorist blast, expressing sympathy with the Iraqi government and nation as well as all the families of the victims. 
Touching on reports that Iranian citizens were among the victims, Bahram Qassemi said, ‚ÄúThe Foreign Ministry and the Islamic Republic of Iran‚Äôs Embassy in Baghdad are investigating the issue with seriousness‚Äù and will take necessary measures in that regard. 
The Iranian official also stressed that such pre-planned and savage assaults emanate from the desperation of the terrorists, who are taking successive blows on the battlefield. 
‚ÄúThese brutal and inhumane acts will not affect the Iraqi government and nation‚Äôs determination and the Islamic Republic of Iran‚Äôs support for the oppressed Iraqi people in the unrelenting fight against terrorism,‚Äù Qassemi said. The photo shows the site of a blast at a gas station near Hilla, south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, November 24, 2016. 
‚ÄòTerrorists killing pilgrims will be brought to justice‚Äô 
In another development, Iraq‚Äôs President Fuad Masum strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Hilla, emphasizing that such terrorist crimes would not go unpunished. 
Issuing an official statement hours after the terrorist attack, which was claimed by the Daesh Takfiri group, Masum emphasized that terrorists, who target the lives of innocent pilgrims traveling to Iraq from Islamic countries, will be brought to justice. 
He also called on Iraq‚Äôs security forces to double their efforts and take necessary measures to uproot terrorist groups that endanger the life and safety of the pilgrims visiting Iraq‚Äôs holy shrines.

Meanwhile, Lebanon‚Äôs resistance movement, Hezbollah, condemned the explosion as a crime committed by the terrorists, who have no conscience and spill the blood of innocents in the name of the religion. 
In a statement released on Thursday, Hezbollah extended its condolences to the Iraqi nation over the tragedy, calling for more efforts to root out terror outfits in Iraq and restore security to the country.

(Photo by IRNA) 
Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani says the European Union can play a significant role in the settlement of the Syrian crisis and the campaign against terrorism. 
Larijani made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinist√∂ in Tehran on Wednesday. 
He said that Iran supports political solutions to crises in the Middle East, including the conflict in Syria, while some extra-regional players as well as regional sponsors of terrorist groups sabotaged diplomatic solutions through adopting wrong approaches. 
The top Iranian parliamentarian also warned against the spillover of terrorism to other regions across the world. 
‚ÄúUnfortunately, military intervention by outsiders in regional issues and adopting a military approach and double standards on terrorism‚Äù have led to a rise in the number of terrorist groups and contributed to their activities, Larijani said. 
He also blamed the ‚Äúextremist and deviated‚Äù ideology of Wahhabism for the spread of terrorism in the region, stressing that neither Sunnis nor Shias support terrorist or extremist acts. 
Elsewhere in his remarks, Larijani welcomed the expansion of ties between Tehran and Helsinki. 
The Finnish official, for his part, called for the further promotion of ties between his country and Iran. 
He also expressed regret about terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria and the lack of a political will to end the conflicts.

In the meeting, Rafsanjani warned about possible threats posed by foreign recruits when they return to their own countries and the subsequent rise of terrorism across the world, and called on the international community to take measures to address the issue. 
The senior Iranian official also raised the alarm over the issue of ‚Äústate terrorism‚Äù pursued by the Zionists. 
Earlier in the day, Finland‚Äôs president also met and held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on the developments in the Middle East and the promotion of bilateral ties in different sectors, including economic and banking cooperation. 
Niinist√∂ arrived in Tehran on Tuesday to hold talks with Iranian officials on a range of issues.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has passed a second resolution to endorse the fact that Jerusalem al-Quds is a Muslim city and the so-called Temple Mount is an Islamic site called Haram al-Sharif. The UNESCO adopted the first resolution to reaffirm the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound on October 18. 
John Steppling, author and commentator, told Press TV that the Israeli authorities ‚Äúhave been getting away with the violations of international law for 50 years,‚Äù as a result of the US‚Äô all-out support for their crimes. 
‚ÄúThey (the Israeli authorities) pretty much do what they want because the United States protects them,‚Äù he added.

The Pentagon's plan to launch an offensive against the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group in Syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the Syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group, says James Petras, an American political commentator. 
US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told NBC News on Wednesday that the Pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust Daesh from the Syrian city of Raqqah, the terror group‚Äôs stronghold in the country. 
Carter, who was in Iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh, said the Raqqah offensive would begin when Iraq‚Äôs second largest city is cleared. 
He claimed that US forces won't be directly involved in any of the operations. 
‚ÄúThis is a ploy to have the US in northern Syria,‚Äù Petras said, arguing that the US was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat Daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflict-ridden country. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that the attack on Raqqah is a positive move because I think it brings the US closer to its policy of establishing a no-fly zone in northern Syria which will directly affect the efforts of the Syrian government and its allies‚ÄîIran and Russia‚Äîto defend the country.‚Äù 
The analyst noted that Raqqah is a ‚Äúproblem for the Syrian people‚Äù and Damascus should be allowed to choose its allies in the battle. 
Petras went on to note that Carter‚Äôs remarks bear similarities to US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs plans for a ‚Äúconflagration‚Äù in the Middle East. 
The ongoing Western efforts in Syria have a different nature. Washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power. 
Carter‚Äôs claim that US ground forces will have no part in the fight against Daesh came at a time when more than 5,000 American soldiers were stationed in Iraq, tasked with providing training and intelligence to Iraqi forces.

Clashes involving police have erupted in the Sudanese capital Khartoum as hundreds of people demonstrated in protest against the government's land policies. 
The peaceful protest turned violent after riot police fired tear gas canisters at the demonstrators in East Jreif district. 
‚ÄúOur land belongs to our ancestors and the government wants to give it to investors. We are protesting to save our land,‚Äù a protester said, regretting that the government had shown no intention of compensating the land owners in case their property was seized. 
Some protesters pelted police officers and members of security forces with rocks. Others burned tires and tried to close off all the streets in East Jreif. 
Police had a heavy presence with reports saying that 15 trucks of riot policemen armed with batons were deployed in the area. 
People stage routine protests in Sudan, complaining about local grievances, but most of the demonstrations are crushed by security forces. A similar demonstration in East Jreif last year led to the death of a protester. Anti-government rallies in April also left two students dead. 
There was no immediate report of possible casualties during the Wednesday rally in Khartoum. 
A government decision to slash fuel subsidies in September 2013 sparked mass protests in Sudan. Thousands of people took to the streets in the capital and some other towns, calling for President Omar al-Bashir to step down.

Secret peace negotiations between Mozambique's opposition leader Afonso Dhlakama and EU mediators were annulled at the weekend after fighting erupted between the country's army and former rebel fighters, local media say. 
The meeting aimed to contribute to talks that began in May to find a solution to the conflict between the government and Dhlakama‚Äôs rebel group turned political party Renamo. 
""We had agreed (with President Filipe Nyusi) that two mediators would come ... to meet me,"" the independent weekly Canal de Mocambique quoted Dhlakama as saying. 
Dhlakama said he had cancelled the meeting after the army increased its presence near the place of the meeting. 
""There was a violent shootout. I even heard explosions from here,"" said Dhlakama, who has been in hiding in the central Gorongosa mountains since October 2015. 
""So I called (chief mediator Mario) Raffaelli to tell him that armed forces had come to ambush me,"" he added. 
Dhlakama quoted the mediator as saying that he was ""convinced"" that the ruling Frelimo party ""wanted to capture me during the meeting."" 
""It is obvious they have a plan to kill me,"" he added. 
Raffaelli declined to comment on the matter but an EU diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that two mediators had gone to Gorongosa for a meeting with the opposition leader. 
The diplomat said Dhlakama had told the mediators to ""turn back at the very last moment."" 
The political situation in Mozambique has been tense for months with Dhlakama refusing to recognize the results of the 2014 elections, where the Frelimo party was declared the winner. The party has been in power since the southern African country‚Äôs independence from Portugal in 1975. Dhlakama also threatened to seize power by force in the northern half of the country. 
Renamo and the Frelimo-led government had been engaged in a civil war for 16 years that was brought to an end in 1992. 
Renamo's armed wing has conducted a string of fatal assaults in central Mozambique in recent years as it seeks to increase its share of power. 
On October 19, the warring sides resumed a new round of peace talks despite the killing of an opposition negotiator on October 9. 
The mediators continued separate talks on Tuesday with representatives of each side.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has approved a motion that endorses the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and slams Israeli provocations around the holy site. 
UNESCO's 21-member World Heritage Committee adopted the resolution in Wednesday's secret ballot at the agency‚Äôs headquarters in Paris. 
Ten countries voted for, two against, eight abstained and one was absent in the voting. 
The resolution expresses UNESCO‚Äôs deep concerns over Israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem al-Quds. 
Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the Tel Aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
‚ÄúThrough an orchestrated campaign, Israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem,‚Äù Erekat said. 
He further noted that the UNESCO resolution urges ‚Äúrespecting the status quo of its religious sites, including the al-Aqsa Mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the Israeli government and extremist Jewish groups.‚Äù 
Earlier this month, UNESCO‚Äôs 58-member Executive Board approved a similar resolution, prompting a furious reaction from Israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency. 
Wednesday‚Äôs vote further infuriated Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that the regime‚Äôs ambassador to UNESCO, Carmel Shama-Hacohen, had been recalled for consultations. 
""We will decide what the next steps will be,‚Äù Netanyahu said in a statement. 
Elias Sanbar, Palestine‚Äôs UNESCO envoy, fired back at those upset with the resolution and warned that Israelis were ‚Äúpoliticizing religion and this is very dangerous."" 
Makram Mustafa Queisi, Jordan‚Äôs ambassador to UNESCO, also stressed that UNESCO tried to tackle the issue from a ‚Äútechnical point of view‚Äù while many parties were politicizing it.

Palestine became the 195th full member of UNESCO in October 2011, triggering a cut in Tel Aviv‚Äôs funding to the agency.

British Defense Minister Michael Fallon says the UK is set to deploy hundreds of troops to the Baltic region in Europe to support its NATO allies in the face of a ‚Äúmore assertive Russia.‚Äù 
Fallon told a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that Britain would send 800 soldiers to Estonia to fulfill its pledge to deliver one of four battalions to NATO‚Äôs Enhanced Forward Presence in Eastern Europe. 
‚ÄúBacked by a rising defense budget, this deployment of air, land and sea forces shows that we will continue to play a leading role in NATO, supporting the defense and security of our allies from the north to the south of the alliance,‚Äù Fallon said. 
NATO had announced in July that it would deploy, on a rotational basis, four multinational battalions to Poland and the Baltic states‚ÄîEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania‚Äîto deter what it referred to as ‚Äúany Russian incursion.‚Äù 
During his address at the meeting, Fallon also said that four British Typhoon fighter jets would be dispatched to Romania under the NATO Southern Air Policing mission, which is supposed to protect the Baltic states' airspace against possible attacks from Russia. 
‚ÄúThis is about two things: reassurance, and that needs to be done with some formidable presence, and deterrence,‚Äù Fallon had said in an earlier interview. ‚ÄúThis is not simply a trip-wire‚Ä¶.This is a serious military presence.‚Äù 
The move is likely to draw criticism from Moscow, which has been angered by NATO‚Äôs military buildup on its Western borders. 
The US-led military alliance cut its ties with Moscow in 2014 and has been reinforcing its presence near Russia‚Äôs borders ever since. 
The UK and Russia have strong disagreements over a number of issues, mainly the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. 
The two countries‚Äô military forces have been involved in a series of aerial and naval confrontations, with Britain sending its jets and warships on several occasions to intercept Russian bombers and naval fleets. 
The latest of those encounters occurred on Thursday, when the Russian aircraft career Admiral Kuznetsov and its seven-ship task force were ‚Äúshadowed‚Äù by two British warships on a course to sail through the North Sea and English Channel, on their way to Syria.

A military statement said on Wednesday that ‚Äúunprovoked‚Äù firing by the Indian forces took place along the ‚Äúworking boundary,‚Äù which separates Pakistan‚Äôs Punjab province from Indian-controlled Kashmir. 
The two were killed in the village of Chaprar, the statement said, adding that ""eight civilians were also injured by the Indian fire."" 
Separately, a Pakistani civilian who was injured due to an earlier cross-border shelling succumbed to injuries on Wednesday. 
The Pakistani military said, ""Another civilian... who was injured by the Indian firing at Line of Control (LoC) Monday (October 24), succumbed to injuries today."" 
Tensions have been running high along the Line of Control, which divides the two neighbors in Kashmir. Pakistani villagers show the wall of a house damaged by heavy mortar shells fired by Indian troops in the border village of Chaprar on October 24, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
The Pakistani Foreign Ministry summoned a senior Indian diplomat to lodge a protest ""over the unprovoked firing by India on the LoC and the working boundary on October 25 and 26."" 
The ministry called on India to ""instruct its troops to respect the ceasefire"" and ""refrain from intentionally targeting the villages and maintain peace."" 
Relations between the two countries have plummeted in recent months, with India blaming Pakistan for a raid on an army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir in September that killed 19 soldiers. New Delhi responded with what it called ""surgical strikes,"" infuriating Islamabad. 
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan but claimed in full by both since the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. 
India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in Kashmir on November 26, 2003, and launched a peace process the following year. Since then, there have been sporadic clashes, with the two sides trading accusations of violating the ceasefire along their de facto border.

(AFP photo) 
James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, has warned that the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could prompt Russia to shoot down US planes. This comes as Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the 2016 US presidential election, has called for establishing a no-fly zone in the Arab country. Russia has recently deployed mobile S-400 and S-300 missile batteries to western Syria, which are ready to shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft. 
Gordon Duff, a senior editor with the Veterans Today, told Press TV that James Clapper who spoke out against former secretary of state‚Äôs emphasis on a no-fly zone over Syria is responsible, because the American officials obtain their intelligence on the Syrian conflict from the spy chief. 
‚ÄúThe public position of the United States vis-√†-vis Syria was established based on intelligence supplied exclusively by James Clapper,‚Äù Duff noted, adding, ‚ÄúHe (Clapper) is the one that talks about the gas, he‚Äôs the one who talks about the barrel bombs, [and] everything that‚Äôs been disproven.‚Äù 
He said, ‚ÄúEvery crazy scheme that the US comes up with to blame Syria for killing its own people or the Russians for slaughtering people in hospitals, it all comes from James Clapper, the director of the National Intelligence Agency, who fed that information to Secretary Clinton, who fed that information to President [Barack] Obama.‚Äù 
‚ÄúClinton said that she favored a no-fly zone only if acceptable for both Russia and Damascus and after negotiations,‚Äù which is a very different story than the one said by the spy chief for political purposes, Duff said. 
Duff added that the imposition of ‚Äúno-fly zone obviously is going to help no one but al-Nusra [Front] and ISIS (Daesh)‚Äù terrorists. 
Damascus and Moscow carry out airstrikes against terrorist groups who wreak havoc in the Arab country, but the US and its allies push for imposing a no-fly zone on Syria to pursue their agenda in the war-ridden state. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been gripped with foreign-backed militancy, which has left hundreds of thousands of people dead or wounded and millions of others homeless.

Clashes have erupted outside South Africa's parliament as police struggled to disperse students protesting against financial hardships and the deteriorating economic situation in the country. 
The protest on Wednesday outside the national assembly building in Cape Town saw a direct confrontation between the police and about 2,000 students. 
The protesting students were mainly angry at the increased tuition fees in the universities. They also voiced anger at South Africa‚Äôs grim economic prospects. 
Other cities across the country have seen similar protests over the past weeks, some of them violent. Officials in Cape Town, Johannesburg and elsewhere have even ordered the temporary closure of the universities to calm down the situation.

The clashes on Wednesday came as Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan delivered a speech in the parliament to warn about South Africa‚Äôs weakening economy, although he vowed that the government would do anything to help students in the country cope with financial problems. 
‚ÄúWe will do everything that is possible to regain normality on our campuses. We want the violence to stop,‚Äù Gordhan said, adding, ‚ÄúMany students face financial hardships that undermine their ability to succeed academically.‚Äù 
Gordhan said South Africa‚Äôs 2016 growth forecast stood at 0.5 percent. He also stated that an extra 17 billion rand ($1.2 billion) would be earmarked for funding university students. 
He warned that a growing sense of political uncertainty in South Africa could seriously harm the country‚Äôs financial position in the world. 
‚ÄúMuch more disturbing, and more difficult, is the rise in our own communities of anger and discontent, spilling over into violence and destructive protests,‚Äù Gordhan said, adding, ‚ÄúIt is not just that our economic outlook is distressed, and there is the possibility of downgrades in credit ratings.‚Äù 
Gordhan‚Äôs promise of spending cuts and fighting corruption has triggered a new political stand-off in South Africa. He has been ordered to appear in court on November 2 to face charges of fraud in what many see as a direct clash between him and people loyal to President Jacob Zuma. The minister enjoys a good deal of public support over his record in office. 
Some senior members of Zuma‚Äôs African National Congress (ANC) have dismissed charges against Gordhan as politically motivated, calling on Zuma and the ANC‚Äôs senior figures to resign to save the party from the current political turmoil.

The UN refugee agency, also known as the UNHCR, says the number of refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea on their way to Europe in 2016 has reached an all-time high. 
""We can confirm that at least 3,800 people have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, making the death toll in 2016 the highest ever recorded,"" said the UN refugee agency spokesman, William Spindler, on Wednesday. 
The alarming surge, which surpassed the death toll of 3,771 for 2015, comes despite a considerable decline in the number of refugees crossing the Mediterranean in 2016. 
More than a million people reached Europe via the Mediterranean in 2016, while fewer than 330,000 crossings have been reported so far this year. 
The number of refugees heading to Europe has declined as the European Union in March signed a controversial deal with Turkey aimed at stemming the flow of refugees into the continent by forcing those deported from the EU to either be located in Turkey or go back to the original country of departure. 
Since then, the route between Libya and Italy across the central Mediterranean has become the main way as pathways to Greece have been closed down. 
According to the agency, the likelihood of perishing in the shorter route between Turkey and Greece was one in 88, while one death for every 47 arrivals was reported in the most perilous route between Libya and Italy in 2016. 
The UNHCR attributed the surge mainly to the overcrowded ‚Äúlower quality vessels, flimsy inflatable rafts‚Äù often used by smugglers. In this October 21, 2016 photo provided by Sea-Watch aid group refugees sit in an inflatable boat off the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean Sea. (Via AP) 
25 refugees found dead in Mediterranean Sea, MSF says 
Earlier on Wednesday, Doctors Without Borders, known as the MSF by its French acronym, said 25 bodies had been retrieved from a refugee boat during a rescue operation in the Mediterranean. 
The MSF said its ship, Bourbon Argos, found the bodies aboard the vessel 26 nautical miles off Libya late on Tuesday. The vessel was carrying 107 survivors. The victims had apparently been burned, suffocated or drowned. 
The recovery operation, which took place with the help of a team from the Berlin-based non-governmental organization Sea-Watch, took a long time as the boat was flooded with a mixture of fuel and seawater. 
""The mixture of water and fuel was so foul that we could not stay on the boat for long periods. It was horrible,"" said Michele Telaro, the MSF project leader. 
The MSF also saved 139 people aboard another dinghy on Tuesday. Sea-Watch recovered a body in another operation. 
The Italian Coast Guard reported that 500 refugees were rescued from overcrowded boats on Tuesday. 
Most of the asylum seekers that have triggered the unprecedented influx of refugees Europe has been dealing with over the past few years flee conflict-ridden zones in North Africa and the Middle East, particularly Syria. Many blame Western policies toward the conflicts for the refugee crisis.

US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter says the Pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group from the Syrian city of Raqqah, the terror group‚Äôs stronghold in the country. 
Speaking to NBC News on Wednesday, Carter said Washington was ready to equip Syrian and Kurdish fighters to launch the assault in the near future. 
‚ÄúIt starts in the next few weeks, hat has long been our plan and we will be capable of resourcing both [groups],‚Äù the Pentagon chief noted. 
Carter, who was in Iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh, said the Raqqah offensive would begin when Iraq‚Äôs second largest city is cleared. 
The Iraqi army, backed by volunteer forces, has been engaged in a large military offensive to cleanse Mosul of Daesh terrorists since last week. A coalition of US-led countries has been reportedly providing air support to the operation. 
‚ÄúIt's been long a part of our plan that the Mosul operation would kick off when it did. This was a plan that goes back many months now and that Raqqah would follow soon behind,‚Äù Carter added. Iraqi forces gather in the al-Shura area, south of Mosul, October 24, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Carter acknowledged that US forces won't be directly involved in any of the operations. 
More than 5,000 American soldiers are currently stationed in Iraq, tasked with providing training and intelligence to Iraqi forces, according to US military officials. 
The US-led coalition has also been carrying out airstrikes against purported Daesh positions in Syria since 2014. 
However, the ongoing Western efforts in Syria have a different nature. Washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power. 
Amnesty International, a UK-based rights group, said Wednesday that the US-led airstrikes have killed hundreds of civilians across Syria. 
Carter‚Äôs remarks came only a day after British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said UK special forces will soon resume training ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù militants in Syria to bolster the fight against Daesh. 
The new effort would be an extension of a failed $500 million program by the Pentagon that was supposed to ‚Äútrain and equip‚Äù up to 5,000 militants every year, but was discontinued in November last year, after failing to attract enough volunteers. 
Russia, which has been pounding Daesh across Syria upon a request from Damascus, says the Western-trained militants‚Äô only use is to oust Assad.

‚ÄúTerrorism is not limited to terror acts committed by some unofficial groups, and mass killings of people by certain governments, such as the Saudi attack on people in a mourning procession in Yemen, which left hundreds killed and injured, are the worst type of terrorism,‚Äù the Leader said in a meeting with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinist√∂ in Tehran on Wednesday. 
Ayatollah Khamenei also described terrorism as one of the ‚Äúpainful‚Äù sufferings gripping the human society, and called for a sincere fight against the scourge. 
‚ÄúCountering terrorism needs the serious resolve of all those who have an influence within global powers,‚Äù the Leader said, calling on world pundits and governments to take measures to deal with the phenomenon.

‚ÄúThese governments calculate all issues based on their own interests, and they do not think about eradicating the malady of terrorism in Iraq or Syria,‚Äù the Leader added.

David Friedman, who was campaigning for the New York billionaire at a restaurant on Mount Zion (Jabel Sahyoun) in East Jerusalem al-Quds, made the comments to AFP after the Wednesday rally. 
""I don't think he believes that the settlements are illegal,"" Friedman said.

The Obama administration has already voiced criticism over Tel Aviv‚Äôs expansionist policies, considered illegal by the international community. 
The presence and continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestine has created a major obstacle for the efforts to establish peace in the Middle East.

Earlier, military sources announced that Peshmerga fighters had established control over Dirik village near the town of Bashiqa, which lies 12 kilometers northeast of Mosul. 
Iraq‚Äôs Joint Operations Command also announced that Iraqi counter-terrorism units were only two kilometers away from Mosul. 
Since the beginning of the operations, the Iraqi army, backed by volunteer forces, has been engaged in a large military offensive to cleanse Mosul of Daesh terrorists. The city fell in 2014 when the terror group started ravaging the country, naming Mosul as its so-called headquarters in Iraq.

(Photo by AP) 
Israeli troops have razed to the ground at least three houses in the East Jerusalem al-Quds, in the latest demolition of Palestinian property in the occupied territories. 
Local media reported that Israeli forces demolished the buildings in the neighborhoods of Beit Hanina and Silwan on Wednesday without prior notice, displacing at least 44 Palestinians including children. 
The United Nations has documented a dramatic rise in demolitions, saying 124 Palestinians, including 60 children, were left homeless in the occupied West Bank in a single day in April. 
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) also said in August that a total of 726 Palestinian structures had been razed in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem al-Quds since January, and that the demolitions had affected 1,020 Palestinians. 
The world body noted that there were 533 demolitions and 688 displaced Palestinians in the entire 2015, meaning that demolitions so far this year have increased more than 36 percent. This picture taken on March 14, 2011 shows a general view of a construction site in the West Bank settlement of Modiin Illit. (Photo by AP) 
The demolitions have raised alarm among diplomats and human rights groups over Tel Aviv's sustained violation of international law. The demolished structures include houses and schools. 
The Israeli razing of Palestinian homes along with its illegal settlement expansion in the occupied Palestinian territories have dimmed hopes of any peace in the region. 
Over half a million Israelis live in more than 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank, including East al-Quds. The settlements are considered by the international community as illegal. 
The occupied territories have witnessed increased tensions ever since Israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem al-Quds in August 2015. 
Nearly 250 Palestinians have lost their lives at the hands of Israeli forces since the beginning of last October.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has refused to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia‚Äôs place at the UN Human Rights Council despite the regime‚Äôs atrocities in Yemen. 
During a debate at the House of Commons in Parliament on Wednesday, May shunned answering the call of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to end the country's weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
""The issues are being investigated‚Ä¶ We are very clear that the only solution that is going to work for Yemen is actually to make sure that we have the political solution that will give stability in Yemen,"" May told Corbyn and the parliamentarians. 
Instead of answering the direct question, May spoke about the UK government‚Äôs contribution to the humanitarian aid provided to the crisis-torn country. 
Corbyn also questioned May‚Äôs support for Saudi Arabia‚Äôs membership in the UN Human Rights Council. A crucial vote on the membership of Riyadh in the council will take place later this month.

London has repeatedly been blamed by human rights groups, including Oxfam and Amnesty International, for fueling the Yemeni war by supplying Saudi Arabia with weapons. 
Since the conflict began last year, the British government has approved more than ¬£3 billion ($3.7 billion) in arms sales to the Saudis and military contractors hope more deals are in the pipeline. 
Yemen has been under almost daily airstrikes by Saudi Arabia since March 2015. International sources put the death toll from the aggression at almost 10,000.

Iran says its exports of hand-woven carpets to the United States have reached around $50 million since the removal of sanctions in January. 
Hamid Kargar, head of the Iran National Carpet Center, told Reuters that Iran was under pressure in the US market by rivals such as like India, Pakistan and Turkey during the years that the sanctions were in place. 
Kargar emphasized that the world‚Äôs largest buyer imported more than $80 million worth from Iran in 2010, before the trade embargo on the country was tightened. 
He emphasized that a growth in exports of hand-woven carpets will have a positive impact on the lives of the carpet weavers in the country. 
There are almost 1 million carpet weavers in Iran, 700,000 of whom are working full-time, Kargar said. 
Between March and September this year, Iran exported $134 million worth of handmade carpets, or 2,330 tons, to 80 countries, Reuters said. That was a 17.7 percent increase in value and 10 percent rise in weight compared to a year earlier. 
During the sanctions years, Iran partially compensated for its loss of market share in the United States and Europe by finding new buyers in Russia, China, South Africa and some Latin American countries, the report added. It still holds about 30 percent of the global trade in handmade carpets, Kargar further told Reuters.

(Photo by AFP) 
Cypriot political leaders have agreed to continue talks in Switzerland next month in an attempt to reach an agreement on the reunification of the Mediterranean island country, the United Nations (UN) has announced. 
A UN spokesman, Aleem Siddique, made the announcement on Wednesday, saying Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci will meet at Mont Pelerin, near Lake Geneva, from November 7 to 11. 
Siddique said the two leaders, in the presence of the UN envoy for Cyprus, will concentrate their talks on how much territory each side will administer under an envisioned federation and will discuss all other outstanding issues, too. 
The leaders have expressed hope that the Switzerland meeting ‚Äúwill pave the way for the last phase of talks in line with their shared commitment to do their utmost in order to reach a settlement within 2016,‚Äù the UN spokesman said. 
Negotiations on reuniting the Mediterranean island under a single federal roof have made significant headway since Anastasiades and Akinci resumed talks led by the UN nearly 18 months ago. 
However, important differences still remain on the question of territorial arrangements, security and property rights. 
Previous UN-mediated talks to reunify the Mediterranean island faced a deadlock in October 2014 when Turkey announced plans to search for oil and gas in waters off Cyprus. 
Cyprus has been divided since 1974, after an intervention by Turkey, which came when a military coup was carried out by individuals who sought to unify the island with Greece. 
Nearly one decade later in 1983, Turkish Cypriots declared an independent state, which has only been recognized by Ankara. Turkey has some 35,000 soldiers stationed in the north of that part of Cyprus. 
Cyprus has been a European Union (EU) member since 2004, but only the south enjoys full membership benefits.

These are some of the headlines we are tracking for you in this episode of On the News Line: 
The Syria conundrum 
The crisis in Syria is getting more complicated. Many parties are participating in the war. The administration of US President Barack Obama has been talking about sending more sophisticated weapons to the so-called moderate rebels in Syria. But the White House is hesitant and the plan seems to have stalled. The Turks are after for their own agenda in Syria. It‚Äôs been almost two months since Turkey launched its offensive in northern Syria. According to Ankara, the mission is aimed at clearing its border area of ISIL militants and anti-Turkey Kurdish militants. And that has put Turkey on a collision course with the US, which has invested heavily on the Kurdish fighters. 
EU threat of disintegration 
Things seem to be falling apart in Europe which many believe is under strain from many factors ranging from the Brexit to the rise of the far-right across the European political spectrum to the refugee crisis, which is the worst to hit the continent. The prospect of the European Union seems so bleak that it has rung the alarm in Germany. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned: ""The financial crisis, the refugee influx into Europe and the shock from the Brexit referendum in Great Britain have brought the European Union into violent turmoil.‚Äù Steinmeier warned that this might lead to the collapse of the EU. 
Saudis aim to starve Yemenis 
Reports have surfaced that Saudi Arabia is ""deliberately targeting impoverished Yemen‚Äôs farms and agricultural industry.""

(Photo by Reuters) 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is pushing for its biggest military buildup near Russian borders, as the Western military alliance continues to harbor perceptions of a Russian ‚Äúthreat‚Äù since the days of the Cold War. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will discuss the plan for military deployments to the Baltic states and eastern Poland at a two-day meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. 
The military alliance aims to send ‚Äúbattle groups‚Äù to the Baltic states and Poland early next year. The groups will consist of 40,000 forces. It will be the biggest military buildup near Russia since the Second World War. More forces would also be deployed if necessary. 
‚ÄúThis is credible deterrence. Not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent conflict,‚Äù Stoltenberg claimed contradictorily on Tuesday, referring to the planned deployments near Russia. ‚ÄúConcrete proof that NATO can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies. And a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.‚Äù 
The United States, Germany, Britain, and Canada have already agreed to contribute forces to the ‚Äúbattle groups,‚Äù which are to be deployed to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Norwegian and Italian fighter jets patrol over the Baltics during a NATO air policing mission from an airbase in Lithuania, May 20, 2015. (Photo by Reuters) 
France, Denmark, Italy and other NATO members are expected to contribute forces of their own but have been reluctant so far. 
Anti-Russia by default 
Russia had previously warned that it would take unspecified measures to respond to the increased activities by the Western military bloc. 
It also moved nuclear-capable missiles to its westernmost region of Kaliningrad, near its border with the Baltic countries and NATO member states earlier this month. The Iskander-M cruise missiles are capable of hitting targets across Poland and the Baltics. 
NATO was formed during the Cold War as a means of countering the former Soviet Union. 
The military alliance suspended all ties with Moscow in April 2014, after the then-Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula voted in a referendum to join Russian territory. 
Shortly afterwards, an armed conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine, areas inhabited by an ethnically-Russian population. The Ukrainian government, which militarized the originally peaceful unrest in the regions ‚Äî known as the Donbass ‚Äî has ever since been accusing Russia of having a hand in the conflict there. Moscow denies the claim. 
The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 9,200 people and left over 21,000 others injured. Loading ...

Former US Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders has denounced Republican nominee Donald Trump as a ‚Äúpolitical coward‚Äù over a voter suppression report. 
Sanders condemned Trump after a report that the Republican's presidential campaign has three ""voter suppression"" drives intended to lower turnout for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to help Trump winning the White House. 
""Anybody who is suppressing the vote because they know that those people will vote against them is a political coward,"" the Vermont senator tweeted. 
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have the guts to run for office on your ideas @ realDonaldTrump , then you shouldn‚Äôt run for office at all,‚Äù he said in another tweet. 
A senior adviser to Trump acknowledged in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that the Republican team has ""three major voter suppression operations underway."" 
Sanders ‚Äì a former primary rival of Clinton ‚Äì suspended his campaign in July and endorsed the former secretary of state, despite leaked emails that showed top officials at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) privately planned to undermine Sanders‚Äôs presidential campaign. 
Sanders had earlier said that he would not endorse Clinton for president until they meet and he could measure her commitment to combating wealth inequality, and other issues that powered his presidential campaign. 
Sanders‚Äô emphasis on US income inequality and the influence of corporate money on elections and the government helped him attract millions of voters to his campaign.

Don DeBar, a New York-based author and radio host, made the remarks in an interview with Press TV on Thursday, following Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs response to Washington‚Äôs accusations of sponsoring hacking attacks against the US. 
Speaking to foreign policy experts during a Valdai Discussion Club meeting in Sochi, southern Russia on Thursday, Putin said Washington was using Russia as a distraction to cover the fact that this year‚Äôs White House contenders had nothing to offer on real issues. 
‚ÄúThe subject matter of what is being revealed here is definitely an action item that defines who Clinton is,‚Äù DeBar said. 
‚ÄúAlso, the thing that is really galling is the fact that we are told to ignore the content, and the content is something that goes to the heart of governing and also to the heart of Clinton‚Äôs record,‚Äù the analyst noted. 
‚ÄúThis is the person who was married to the guy who signed in ‚Äòthree strikes and you are out legislation‚Äô for people to get life in prison if they are convicted of three felonies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you look at the things that have been revealed here, some of the acts are themselves the violations of three separate federal criminal sanctions.‚Äù 
DeBar argued that Clinton has multiple sets of the triple violations and yet is freely allowed to run for office under federal protection. 
Clinton and her campaign have repeatedly claimed that Russia was trying to rig the November election in favor of Republican nominee Donald Trump. 
During the last presidential debate last week, Clinton accused Trump of having secret ties with Moscow, saying that Putin would love to see a ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù in the White House. 
DeBar dismissed accusations against the Russian president, but noted that since the US was openly seeking regime change in Russia, it is only logical for Russia to fight back. 
Based on that argument, DeBar said: ""It warrants support and not condemnation‚Äù even if Russia was trying to fight back in a way or another.

The United Arab Emirates, a key Saudi ally in its deadly aggression against Yemen, has welcomed a new United Nations peace proposal to end the Yemen conflict. 
""The UAE supports the efforts of UN [Special] Envoy [for Yemen] Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed knowing that the mission of a mediator is always tough,"" Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on his Twitter account on Thursday. 
The remarks came two days after the UN envoy submitted the plan to Yemen‚Äôs Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies. 
According to informed sources, the roadmap urges agreement on naming a new vice president after the withdrawal of Houthis from the capital Sana‚Äôa and other cities and their handover of arms to a third party. 
The initiative further calls on former Yemeni president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, to transfer power to the vice president who would appoint a new premier to form a government. United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, speaks to reporters at Sana‚Äôa airport following his visit to the Yemeni capital on October 25, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
‚ÄúThe roadmap represents a political solution for the Yemeni crisis,‚Äù Gargash said, adding, ‚ÄúUN efforts represent a chance to bring Yemenis back to the political track. Other alternatives are gloomy.‚Äù 
The Hadi administration, however, said that it had not received any roadmap for a political settlement. 
Peace talks, which were held between Yemen‚Äôs opposing parties in Kuwait, ended in deadlock in August. 
Earlier this week, Ahmed made a visit to Sana‚Äôa, where he held meetings with Yemen‚Äôs warring sides and called for a return to a cessation of hostilities to allow aid deliveries. 
The Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a three-day truce in the conflict-ridden country expired. 
Yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. 
The offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government. 
The Houthi Ansarullah fighters took state matters in their own hands after the resignation and escape of Hadi, which threw Yemen into a state of uncertainty and threatened a total security breakdown in the country, where an al-Qaeda affiliate is present.

The US Justice Department has charged 61 people and entities with involvement in a major India-based scam that targeted thousands of Americans. 
The scheme involved Indian call centers, where some workers called American citizens and convinced them to pay their non-existent debts by impersonating Internal Revenue Service (IRS), immigration and other federal officials, the Justice Department said in a statement on Thursday. 
Some victims were even offered short-term loans or grants on condition of providing good-faith deposits or payment of a processing fee. 
The scammers had stolen more than $300 million from at least 15,000 unsuspecting citizens, the department noted. 
The victims‚Äô money was laundered by an American network of criminals who used debit cards or wire transfers under fake identities, the indictment said. 
Federal officials arrested 20 people across America on Thursday. Additionally, 32 individuals and five call centers in India were charged with connection to the case. 
US Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in a press briefing that Washington was looking forward extraditing the suspects from India to face jail terms. 
‚ÄúIt's really important for the scammers in India to know that the United States is looking at this, is watching them and they could, if they engage in that activity, be extradited to the United Sates and could sit in jail ... for several years,‚Äù she said. 
In a bill of indictment for the scammers, the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas had pointed to scare tactics employed by the operators of call centers in Ahmedabad, in the Indian state of Gujarat. 
They ‚Äúthreatened potential victims with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay taxes or penalties to the government,‚Äù it read. 
The extent of the scam was so vast that major federal organizations such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Treasury, Homeland Security, US Secret Service and police had to help with the investigation, according to the Justice Department.

(Photo by AFP) 
One of the most important questions is will US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton rig the election to win the White House like she did in the primaries against Bernie Sanders, asks Myles Hoenig, an American political analyst and activist. 
Recent polls show that Clinton‚Äôs national lead over Trump is shrinking as the Election Day is approaching. 
The former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has 3 percent support among likely voters, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein has 2 percent support. 
‚ÄúIn every election the race tightens towards the end,‚Äù Hoenig told Press TV on Thursday. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other. With Obama and Romney, or even Gore and Bush, many of the issues were shared and the voting was often done on personalities or the historical nature of a first black president, regardless of who was pulling whose strings,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThis election is more polarized than ever. With the Podesta leaks showing Clinton‚Äôs overt racism (calling Donna Brazille a buffalo) as well as proving that President Obama lied to the public about when he learned of Clinton‚Äôs inappropriate use of her emails, and with the news of Trump‚Äôs ACCESS Hollywood tape receding into America‚Äôs short term memory span, it‚Äôs no wonder the polls are tightening,‚Äù the analyst stated. 
‚ÄúThe question of the day is will Clinton rig the election like she did the primary, being the only way she could have won,‚Äù he asked. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre also seeing both Johnson‚Äôs and Stein‚Äôs numbers dropping but so many are not polled that those numbers are harder to verify,‚Äù the commentator noted.

Syrian army soldiers and their allies have managed to liberate a key town in the country‚Äôs west-central province of Hama from the grip of Takfiri terrorists. 
An unnamed Syrian military source said on Thursday that the recapture of the town of Suran came after intensive operations against the gatherings and fortified positions of terror outfits in the area. 
‚ÄúUnits from our armed forces in cooperation with the people‚Äôs defense forces regained control over the municipality of Suran and the farms surrounding it,‚Äù the source said. 
He also noted that the clashes prior to the town‚Äôs liberation left a large number of terrorists dead and many more injured, destroying their armored vehicles as well as cars equipped with machine guns. 
Members of the Syrian army‚Äôs engineering units are detonating explosive devices and mines planted by militants to prevent the Syrian forces‚Äô advance, he added. 
Over the past few weeks, the Syrian forces have wrested control of several areas across the war-torn country as they press ahead with their counter-terrorism operations. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Backed by the Russian air cover, the Syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of Daesh and other terrorist groups. 
The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura have put the death toll from the Syria conflict at more than 300,000 and 400,000, respectively.

An African man has been shot and killed after he reportedly attacked and injured a police officer outside the US embassy in Kenya‚Äôs capital, Nairobi.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed as ‚Äúhysteria‚Äù claims by US officials that Moscow is trying to influence the upcoming presidential election in America. 
Speaking to foreign policy experts during a Valdai Discussion Club meeting in Sochi, southern Russia, on Thursday, Putin said Washington was using Russia as a distraction to cover up the fact that this year‚Äôs White House contenders had nothing to offer on real issues. 
‚ÄúHysteria has been whipped up in the United States about the influence of Russia over the U.S. presidential election,‚Äù Putin said, adding that so far no clear policies have been offered by the US political elite to tackle issues such as national debt and gun control. 
American officials and intelligence agencies have openly accused the Kremlin of sponsoring hacking attacks against the US. 
This is while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign have gone even further, claiming that Russia was trying to rig the November election in favor of Republican nominee Donald Trump. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (L) and Republican nominee Donald Trump 
During the last presidential debate last week, Clinton accused Trump of having secret ties with Moscow, saying that Putin would love to see a ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù president in the White House. 
‚ÄúIt's much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American people's choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what?‚Äù Putin asked in his Thursday speech. 
Baffled by the release of a series of hacked emails that have uncovered the inner mechanics of the Democratic Party‚Äôs campaign for the election, the White House has stepped up its anti-Russian rhetoric. American officials have even threatened Russia with countermeasures. 
Despite the general belief, however, Trump has on many occasions called on Russia-accusers to either provide their evidence or stop making baseless assumptions about Moscow.

Military officials in Tunisia have rejected claims that the country is hosting a base for US drone operations against the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in neighboring Libya. 
Tunisia‚Äôs Defense Minister Farhat Horchani on Thursday ruled out any possibility that foreign forces could have direct access to Tunisian military bases or run their own in the country. 
‚ÄúWe don't -- and won't -- have a foreign military base in Tunisia,"" Horchani said, adding, ‚ÄúWe were one of the few first countries to oppose a foreign military intervention in Libya.‚Äù 
A Tunisian Defense Ministry spokesman also said on Thursday that the North African country has never allowed Washington to operate unmanned planes from its territory for anti-Daesh missions. 
""Tunisian soil has never been and never will be used to strike targets in Libya. The drones are used by Tunisians and no one else,"" Belhassen Oueslati said, adding, ""As part of Tunisian-US bilateral cooperation, we have acquired drones to train our military personnel to use this technology and to control our southeastern border with Libya and detect any suspicious movement."" 
The remarks came after US media claimed that Washington has expanded its deployment of drones to North Africa as part of a secret program. 
A report by the Washington Post said on Wednesday that unmanned aircraft and US military personnel had been deployed to a facility in Tunisia to conduct spy missions in neighboring Libya. The paper added that ""drones began flying out of the Tunisian base in late June,‚Äù claiming that the dispatch of the planes was a key element of the extended US air offensive against a Daesh stronghold in Libya. 
Daesh, which is known for its terror acts in Iraq and Syria, has been operating mostly in northern Libya, a country which slipped into chaos in 2011 following the ouster of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. 
Forces loyal to Libya‚Äôs unity government, which enjoy the support of the West and the United Nations, have been battling Daesh militants over the past six months in the coastal city of Sirte. 
US Africa Command (AFRICOM) said on Thursday that since August 1, Pentagon has carried out 351 airstrikes in Libya to help Libyan forces in the fight in Sirte. 
‚ÄúThere are US service members working with the Tunisian security forces for counter-terrorism and they are sharing intelligence from various sources, to include unarmed aerial platforms,‚Äù said Colonel Mark R. Cheadle, spokesman for US Africa Command. 
Tunisia, which is frequented by Western tourists, has suffered several major attacks by the Daesh terrorist group. 
Last year, a total of 59 foreign tourists were killed in two such assaults by Daesh on the National Bardo Museum in Tunis and a beach resort.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has downplayed suggestions that EU military buildup might undermine the Western alliance as the bid to establish an independent European army appears to gain momentum. 
""I strongly believe it is absolutely possible to strengthen European defense without duplicating efforts by NATO,"" Stoltenberg said on Thursday, adding, ‚ÄúEU leaders have (also) conveyed that this is not about the EU doing collective defense, the EU building structures that would compete with NATO."" 
Stoltenberg made the remarks following a meeting between European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and NATO defense ministers in Brussels. 
Mogherini, one of the strongest supporters of a joint European defense force, has drawn up a global strategy for the bloc, which says the 27-nation bloc should seek ""strategic autonomy"" to face multiple security threats, ranging from conventional to hybrid warfare, from the Ukraine crisis to Syria, from poverty in Africa to massive refugee flows. 
The proposal has sparked concerns that the bloc is seeking a more independent role. 
Mogherini on Thursday said the bloc does have civilian and military operations, such as in Africa or in the Mediterranean, and needs to improve command and control centers to run them. 
She, however, attempted to downplay concerns that the formation of an EU force could lead to the duplication of NATO functions, saying, ""But this can be done ... without any kind of overlapping or duplication with NATO.""

In July, an EU strategy document said that the bloc should look to create greater military autonomy from NATO. It stated the EU could no longer rely on the alliance regarding various security issues and must instead develop an ability to ‚Äúact autonomously if and when necessary.‚Äù

(Photo by AFP) 
US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will win the November 8 election, says an American professor who has correctly predicted almost every presidential election in the United States. 
Professor Helmut Norpoth, of New York‚Äôs SUNY Stony Brook University, said his model shows Trump performed comparatively better in the primaries so he will triumph next month, The Independent reported on Thursday. 
Norpoth developed a model which, when applied retroactively, successfully predicted every presidential election in the United States since 1912 all but one, which was the 2000 election, when it said Democratic nominee Al Gore would beat Republican candidate George W. Bush. But instead Bush won the election. 
Al Gore won the popular vote, but Bush was awarded more votes in the Electoral College following a disputed result in Florida. So Bush was declared winner. 
The political scientist‚Äôs model suggests that the person who emerges as the strongest candidate in the primaries will go on to win the presidency. 
‚ÄúI think he was the strongest candidate in the primaries and that he will prevail,‚Äù Professor Norpoth told the New York Post . 
‚ÄúThe model predicted a Trump win in February and nothing has changed since then. Whatever happens in the real world doesn‚Äôt affect the model,‚Äù he stated. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Professor of Political Science at Stony Brook Helmut Norpoth, New York 
Recent polls show that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Clinton‚Äôs national lead over Trump is shrinking as Election Day is approaching. 
The former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. 
In addition, preliminary figures suggest the US presidential race remains tight in so-called swing states, despite boasting by Clinton‚Äôs campaign that she is far ahead. 
Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has an edge in several of the roughly 10 swing states that will decide the 2016 White House race. 
Trump has also potential advantages of his own in some battleground states. 
On Wednesday, Trump said that he would win the key battleground states of Ohio, Florida and North Carolina, that could help him claim the election. ""I think I'm gonna win,"" Trump told ABC News. 
The billionaire said that he intends to pour in millions of dollars in the final days of the campaign.

(Photo by AP) 
The European Parliament has awarded two Iraqi women from the Izadi minority group its prestigious human rights prize. 
On Thursday, Nadia Murad and Lamia Haji Bashar won the European Parliament's prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for their plight when they, along with other women and girls were abducted, tortured and sexually abused by Daesh terrorists after the militants overran northern Iraq two years ago. 
The two were awarded the prize as part of efforts to protect the Izadis, who are followers of an ancient religion mostly practiced by more than half a million people in northern Iraq. 
The community members, especially women, have been subject to torture, sexual abuse and slavery by Daesh. 
European Parliament chief, Martin Schulz, hailed the two Izadi women for their bravery, saying they had‚Äúa painful and tragic story‚Äù but ‚Äúfelt compelled to survive to bear witness.‚Äù 
""The courage of these two women, [and] the dignity they represent defies all description,‚Äù Schulz told the assembly in Strasbourg. This photo taken on May 5, 2016 shows Lamia Haji Bashar, an 18-year-old Izadi girl who escaped Daesh, in northern Iraq. (Photo by AP) 
Daesh abducted Murad from her home village of Kocho near Iraq's northern town of Sinjar in August 2014. The slight, softly-spoken young woman, who is now 23, was then brought to the city of Mosul, where she was tortured and raped. 
Bashar, from the same village, was enslaved and sold two years ago after watching the slaughter of her family and friends by Daesh. The 18-year-old then fell prey to an Iraqi hospital director after 20 months of captivity. She later lost her right eye in a mine explosion which hit one of her friends.

A female lawyer has accused US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexually assaulting her in 1999, a report says. 
Moira Smith, who works as a corporate lawyer with an Alaska energy company, said the judge made unwanted sexual advances on her during a dinner party when she was 23-year-old, the National Law Journal reported on Thursday. 
She said Thomas grabbed and squeezed her buttocks several times during the party in Falls Church, Virginia. 
‚ÄúJustice Thomas touched me inappropriately and without my consent,‚Äù Smith said. 
‚ÄúHe groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit ‚Äòright next to him,‚Äô‚Äù Smith said. 
‚ÄúHe was 5 or 6 inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him,‚Äù she stated, according to the journal. 
In a statement to the National Law Journal, Thomas, 68, dismissed the allegation as ‚Äúpreposterous‚Äù, saying that the incident ‚Äúnever happened."" 
Smith, currently vice president and general counsel at Enstar Natural Gas Co in Alaska, said she decided to speak out after hearing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's lewd comments about women. 
A 2005 video was released earlier this month by The Washington Post, in which Trump can be heard making lewd comments about women and bragging about groping them. 
A number of women have since come forward claiming that the business mogul has sexually assaulted them. 
Trump has called the allegations ‚Äúslander and libel‚Äù and part of a ‚Äúconcerted, coordinated and vicious attack‚Äù by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the news media to undercut his campaign. Moira Smith said Justice Clarence Thomas groped her at her boss' dinner party when she was 23. 
""That willingness by men in power to take advantage of vulnerable women relies on an unspoken pact that the women will not speak up about it,"" Smith, now 41, told the journal. 
""Why? Because they are vulnerable. Because they are star-struck. Because they don't want to be whiners. Because they worry about their career if they do speak out. But silence no longer feels defensible; it feels complicit,‚Äù she stated. 
""As the mother of a young daughter and son, I am coming forward to show that it is important to stand up for yourself and tell the truth,"" Smith said.

(Via Reuters) 
Russia says it has cancelled plans for a fleet of its warships to refuel at a Spanish port on their way to Syria. 
Vasily Nioradze, a spokesman at the Russian embassy in Madrid, said on Wednesday that the request was canceled, without giving further details, the Associated Press reported. 
The Spanish Foreign Ministry also confirmed that Russia had withdrawn its request for the warships to refuel in the Spanish port of Ceuta. 
""The Russian embassy in Madrid has just told us that it is withdrawing its demand for permission to stop over for the boats, which means that the stopovers have been cancelled,"" the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. 
The development came after Spain, a NATO member state, said it was reviewing Russia's request to refuel its naval fleet at Ceuta after passing through the Straits of Gibraltar en route to Syria, where Russian forces are engaged in an anti-terror campaign in support of the Syrian government. 
In a statement released on Wednesday, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said that Spain had been allowing Russian navy ships to dock in Spanish ports for years, but that it treated such requests on a case by case basis. 
The naval group, which passed through the English Channel on Friday, is made up of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as a nuclear-powered battle cruiser, two anti-submarine warships and four support vessels, escorted by submarines. 
The fleet will join around 10 other Russian vessels already off the Syrian coast. 
Ceuta sits on the tip of Africa‚Äôs north coast, across the Straits of Gibraltar from mainland Spain, and bordering Morocco. The port is part of the EU, but its NATO status is unclear. Since 2011, at least 60 Russian warships have docked in Ceuta. 
NATO irked by Spain‚Äôs announcement 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed that the Western military alliance was ""concerned"" by the deployment of the Russian warships. 
""It is each up to each nation to decide, as has been NATO policy for many years, but we are concerned about the potential use of this carrier group to increase attacks‚Ä¶ in Aleppo,"" Stoltenberg said, adding, ""All allies are aware of our concerns."" 
Britain echoes NATO‚Äôs stance 
British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon also said on Wednesday that London would be ""extremely concerned"" if Spain refueled the Russian carrier group heading through the Mediterranean towards Syria. 
""NATO should be standing together,‚Äù he added. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Russia has been conducting air raids against Daesh and other terrorist groups in the Middle Eastern country at the Damascus government‚Äôs request for more than a year now. 
Russia boosts Baltic Fleet 
In another development on Wednesday, a report said that Russia was reinforcing its Baltic Fleet in Kaliningrad with two small warships armed with long-range cruise missiles to counter a worrying NATO build-up in the region. 
The report by Russia's daily Izvestia quoted an unidentified military source as saying that the vessels, the Serpukhov and the Zeleny Dol, had already entered the Baltic Sea and would soon become part of a newly formed division. 
Kaliningrad shares land borders with Poland and Lithuania. 
The deployment comes at a time when NATO is planning its biggest military buildup on Russia's borders since the Cold War. Loading ...

A top official in Tehran has accused European government of failing to take the required measures to facilitate trade agreements with Iran ‚Äì what he says is already in violation of a nuclear agreement that was sealed with the country last summer and came into effect in January. 
Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, Iran‚Äôs deputy minister of roads and urban development, told the Financial Times that European government should prevent the inclusion of what he described as ‚Äúvery exceptional terms and conditions‚Äù in trade agreements with Iran. 
Fakhrieh Kashan warned that such terms and conditions were effectively discouraging investments in the Iranian economy. 
He said export credit agencies were specifically demanding premiums on insurance that made banks insist on putting what he described as ‚Äúunacceptable terms‚Äù in contracts related to ‚Äúpolitical risk‚Äù in doing business with Iran. 
Fakhrieh Kashan emphasized that Iran will not accept any clauses in trade agreements which he said foresee such possibilities like snapback sanctions and new sanctions against Iran. 
European businesses, he said, are in fact trying to devise deals in which political risks are inserted alongside commercial risks ‚Äì what he said is totally rejected by the Islamic Republic. 
If anyone needed guarantees against political risks, it was Iran, Fakhrieh Kashan said in reference to the impact of western sanctions on the Iranian economy. 
‚ÄúWhy should Iran accept very exceptional terms and conditions in its contracts with European companies? This is not called a normal relationship,‚Äù he said. 
Fakhrieh Kashan emphasized that European countries should take the adequate measures to prevent their businesses from including political risk in contracts, warning that any failure to do so will be against the nuclear agreement with Iran. 
‚ÄúThis is where European countries are failing to be committed to the nuclear agreement. One of the main reasons the signing of contracts in various sectors has been delayed is this issue.‚Äù 
Last summer, Iran signed a historic deal with the US, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany ‚Äì the so-called P5+1 group - based on which it agreed to restrict certain aspects of its nuclear energy activities. The P5+1 in return agreed to lift certain economic sanctions imposed against the Islamic Republic.

He further said the woman, whose nationality he declined to disclose, had been living in Myanmar for several years. 
Zika symptoms may include fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis, and when pregnant women are infected, it can lead to microcephaly, causing severe brain damage in babies.

More than 5,200 refugees have died across the world since the beginning of 2016, says the International Organization for Migration (IOM). 
The organization, which is based in Geneva, said on Friday that of a total of 5,238 deaths, 3,930 people died trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea by boat, indicating a 170-person increase compared to 2015. 
On Wednesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) made a different account with more than 3,800 deaths in the Mediterranean since January, also noting that it was a new record compared to 2015. 
Over 280 asylum seekers trying to reach the European Union died off the Libyan shores recently, according to the IOM. 
The EU said on Thursday it had begun training the Libyan coast guard how to curb the influx of asylum seekers.

The EU launched Operation Sophia last year after hundreds of asylum seekers died when their rickety boats sank off southern Italy. 
The central Mediterranean route has seen more asylum seekers risk their lives in recent months after the EU reached an accord with Turkey in March to halt an influx of refugees crossing the Aegean to reach Europe.

At least 15 civilians are killed and some 100 others injured as foreign-backed militants shell western Aleppo after launching a massive offensive to break the Syrian government's siege over the city. 
A UK-based monitoring group sympathetic to the militants said hundreds of shells and rockets had fallen on various western neighborhoods of the city on Friday. 
Militant groups involved in the attack include Turkey-backed FSA and Jaish al-Fatah, an alliance of terrorist factions actively supported by Saudi Arabia and Turkey, they told news agencies. 
A senior militant said it was going to be ""a big battle"" with all the groups there participating. 
The attack appeared to have been mostly launched by militants from outside the city against government forces that hold its western districts, Reuters news agency reported. 
The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Right said militants had set off several car bombs on the western edge of Aleppo after launching grad rockets at the city's Nairab airbase. 
Heavy militant bombardment, with more than 150 rockets and shells, struck districts on the southwest of the city, it said. 
The Syrian military said a militant attack in that area had been thwarted and the army had destroyed four car bombs. 
The massive assault by foreign-backed militants comes in the wake of a unilateral ""humanitarian pause"" declared by Syria and Russia in the city. 
On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry said aircraft had not carried out any sorties over Aleppo for the past nine days. There were no immediate indication on Friday whether the airstrikes had resumed. 
Militants used a US-Russian ceasefire to break the siege in early August, opening up a new route into the city from the south, but government forces quickly closed it. 
The new civilian deaths came after at least six children were killed and over a dozen people injured after Takfiri terrorists launched rocket attacks on a school as well as a house in Aleppo.";english;2016-10-28T18:02:50.870+03:00;presstv.ir;FR;18495.0;Militant shelling kills at least 15 civilians in western Aleppo;0.0;http://media.presstv.com/photo/20161028/7b36e1fd-d1da-4ef0-af43-b41de5b9a710.jpg;0;0;0;0;0;state

Pakistan has declared an Indian diplomat persona non grata and given him 48 hours to leave the country, in a tit-for-tat move that comes a day after India said it would deport a Pakistani official. 
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said it had declared Indian diplomat Surjeet Singh persona non grata and that it had informed India‚Äôs diplomatic mission in Islamabad of the decision. 
The statement said Singh was accused of activities ‚Äúthat were in violation of the Vienna Convention and the established diplomatic norms.‚Äù 
An aide to India‚Äôs prime minister in New Delhi said the Indian government was looking into the matter. 
The decision came after India said on Thursday it had declared a Pakistani consular official persona non grata for ‚Äúespionage activities‚Äù against New Delhi. 
Mehmood Akhtar, the visa official at the Pakistani mission, had been briefly detained by Indian police on Wednesday outside the gates to the Delhi Zoo where he met two Indian associates. 
Indian police said the Pakistani diplomat and his alleged accomplices were found in possession of forged documents, defense-related maps, deployment charts and lists of officers working along India‚Äôs border with Pakistan.

Pakistan‚Äôs High Commission in New Delhi dismissed the allegation, saying it ‚Äúnever engages in any activity that is incompatible with its diplomatic status.‚Äù 
Relations between India and Pakistan have been strained in recent months, with New Delhi blaming Islamabad for a raid on an army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir in September that killed 19 soldiers. 
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan but claimed in full by both since the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. They have fought four wars with each other, three of which have been over Kashmir. 
'Indian soldier, civilian killed in Kashmir' 
An Indian paramilitary officer claimed that Pakistani troops had opened fire along the volatile frontier in Indian-controlled Kashmir, killing a civilian and a soldier. Pakistan's army denied the claim. 
The Indian officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Pakistani soldiers fired mortars and automatic gunfire at several border posts in Jammu region on Friday in an ""unprovoked"" violation of a ceasefire accord between India and Pakistan in the disputed region. 
Troops from the two countries regularly trade fire, causing casualties.

(Photo by AP) 
Foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Syria have started trilateral talks on a political solution to the Syria crisis besides a serious fight against the Takfiri terror groups operating in the Arab country. 
On Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Russian and Syrian counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Walid Muallem, gathered in Moscow for a three-way meeting. 
Ahead of the meeting, Lavrov said the three nations are acting as a united front against terrorism, saying their talks are mainly focused on ways of seriously tackling terrorism, particularly in Syria. 
The three sides, Lavrov added, will exchange views on humanitarian operations as well as efforts to stop the flow of weapons and military equipment to the foreign-backed militants operating against the Damascus government. 
Prior to the three-way discussions, Zarif held a bilateral meeting with Lavrov to discuss regional issues and the further enhancement of bilateral Tehran-Moscow ties.

Upon his arrival at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow on Friday morning, Zarif said a political solution besides a serious fight against terrorism is the only way out of the crisis gripping Syria. 
‚ÄúUnfortunately, some countries have always pursued war and a military solution in Syria. This is while the solution to this crisis is of a political nature and also [entails] battles against Takfiri groups,‚Äù said Zarif. 
He added, ‚ÄúWe have always emphasized the need for the establishment of an all-out ceasefire, humanitarian operations and efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian issue.‚Äù 
Following the trilateral talks, the three ministers attended a joint press conference. 
During the presser, Muallem slammed the US-led coalition purportedly fighting Daesh, saying the alliance has never been fighting terrorism despite its claims. 
He said the Washington-led campaign was in fact encouraging Daesh terrorists to move from Iraq‚Äôs Mosul to Syria‚Äôs Raqqah. 
Mosul and Raqqah have served as the main Daesh bases in the Middle East over the past years. Iraqi and Syrian armed forces are engaged in large-scale military offensive to drive the terror group from the two cities. 
The Syrian foreign minister further said his country would continue cooperation with Iran and Russia in efforts to eradicate terrorism. 
Muallem described the atmosphere of the talks in Russia as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and ‚Äúvery comfortable.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWe in Syria have become convinced of the sincerity of the Russian and Iranian efforts in helping us rout terrorism,‚Äù he added.

(Photo by Reuters) 
Zarif, in turn, described the talks in Moscow as ‚Äúvery productive,‚Äù saying Iran and Russia have developed ‚Äúvery close‚Äù relations in different areas. 
Commenting on the situation in Syria, the top Iranian diplomat said Syria‚Äôs sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected, adding that it is up to the Syrian nation to determine its own destiny and that the voice of the Syrians must be recognized. 
He further highlighted the need for a political settlement of the crisis, adding that Tehran backs the resumption of peace talks between the Syrian government and opposition. 
The Iranian minister called for a ceasefire in Syria, joint battles against terror groups as well as efforts to facilitate aid delivery to Syrian civilians in besieged areas. 
He said the global community must unite in the battle against terrorism, which poses a threat not only to Syria, but the entire world. 
Zarif added that supporting terrorism would serve the interest of no one, warning that the terror groups would eventually ‚Äúbite the hands that feed them.‚Äù 
For his part, the Russian foreign minister also touched on the Mosul battle in Iraq, saying that Iraqi city‚Äôs liberation from Daesh would have a significant impact on the balance of power in neighboring Syria. 
Lavrov said the political settlement in Syria should be achieved through dialogue according to the Security Council resolutions, welcoming Syria‚Äôs readiness to resume the stalled talks with the opposition. 
Referring to the situation in Aleppo, Lavrov said terrorists blocked the exit routes opened as part of a Syrian humanitarian pause and prevented the civilians from leaving the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo City. 
The senior Russian official also criticized the international organizations for failing to fulfill their duties towards the locals of eastern Aleppo. 
Lavrov emphasized that the fight against terrorism in Syria will continue, adding that ‚Äúfuture common steps‚Äù in this regard during the Moscow talks.

Oh well. The Assassination of Russia - FSB false flag bombings of 1999 https://youtu.be/y9cRoXgawVA In the fall of 1999, a wave of bloody apartment bombings swept through Russian cities, killing 293 people and causing widespread panic. Although blamed on the Chechen terrorists that the Russians were fighting in the Second Chechen War, FSB agents were caught planting the exact same type of bombs as in the other blasts later that month. The government claimed that the bomb was part of a security exercise and Vladimir Putin came to power as the next Russian President on the back of the terror wave later that year. http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a092299ryazanbomb#a092299ryazanbomb On the evening of September 22, 1999, several residents of an apartment block in Ryazan, a city about a hundred miles south of Moscow, observe three strangers at the entrance of their building. The two young men and a woman are carrying large sacks into the basement. The residents notice that the car¬ís plate has been partially covered with paper, although they can still see a Moscow license plate number underneath. They decide to call the local police. After several bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow earlier in the month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999), their vigilance is understandable. When the police arrive, around 9:00 p.m., they uncover what appears to be huge bomb: three sacks of sugar filled with a granular powder, connected to a detonator and a timing device set for 5:30 a.m. The bomb squad uses a gas testing device to confirm that it is explosive material: it appears to be hexagen, the military explosive that is believed to have been used to blow up two Moscow blocks. The residents are evacuated. Then the bomb carted away and turned over to the FSB. (In an apparent oversight, the FSB fails to collect the detonator, which is photographed by the local police.) The following morning, September 23, the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted. They praise the vigilance of the local people and the Ryazan police. Police comb the city and find the suspects¬í car. A telephone operator for long-distance calls reports that she overheard a suspicious conversation: the caller said there were too many police to leave town undetected and was told, ¬ìSplit up and each of you make your own way out.¬î To the police¬ís astonishment, the number called belongs to the FSB. Later this day, the massive manhunt succeeds: the suspects are arrested. But the police are again stunned when the suspects present FSB credentials. On Moscow¬ís orders, they are quietly released. On September 24, the government reverses itself and now says the bomb was a dummy and the whole operation an exercise to test local vigilance. The official announcement is met with disbelief and anger. Ryazan residents, thousands of whom have had to spend the previous night outdoors, are outraged; local authorities protest that they were not informed. However, the suspicion of a government provocation is not widely expressed and press coverage fades after a few days. It is only several months later that an investigation by the independent weekly Novaya Gazeta re-ignites the controversy (see February 20, 2000 and Fall 1999). The government¬ís explanations will fail to convince skeptics (see March 23, 2000). The Ryazan incident later becomes the main reason for suspecting the government of having orchestrated previous bombings. The controversy is then widely reported in the international press.

On September 22, 1999, a bomb was discovered in the city of Ryazan, about 100 miles south of Moscow. After the chief bomb suspects were discovered to be FSB agents, the government claimed the bomb was a dummy and the incident was a training exercise (see September 22-24, 1999). But the bomb-squad officer, Yuri Tkachenko, is adamant that it was a professionally-prepared, military-style bomb. He defends the accuracy of his sophisticated gas-testing device which identified the explosives as hexogen. The article provokes much comment in Russia but is ignored by the government.

[Source: Terror99.ru]A team of FSB officials, led by Alexander Zdanovich, agrees to a televised meeting with angry and suspicious residents of Ryazan, hoping to put down rumors of a government provocation and shore up the credibility of the official account. In September 1999 a bomb was found in the basement of a building in Ryazan and the people arrested for planting the bomb were discovered to be FSB agents. The government then claimed the incident was merely a training exercise, but residents suspect the FSB wanted to bomb the building to create a fake terrorist incident (see September 22-24, 1999). Zdavonich apologizes for the inconvenience suffered by Ryazan inhabitants but then suggests the renewed interest in the event is a campaign ploy: ¬ìFor months, there was no interest and there were no publications. The theme was activated on the eve of the presidential election with the most fantastic details in order to accuse the FSB of planning a real explosion with the death of people. This is actively used in the political struggle.¬î (The presidential election is only one week away.) A soldier named Alexei Pinyaev has claimed that he worked at a nearby base where hexogen was reportedly kept in sacks marked ¬ìsugar¬î (see Fall 1999). The commander of the base denies that there was any soldier named Pinyaev, but the Novaya Gazeta reporter who had found Pinyaev then shows pictures of him and plays a recording of his interview. The FSB will not let its three agents appear in public or allow journalists to interview them. The broadcast does not allow any discussion of a possible connection between the Ryazan incident and the apartment bombings in Moscow earlier that month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999). The FSB officials did not have good explanations for the fact that local authorities, including its own FSB office in Ryazan, were not informed of the supposed exercise, or for the lack of medical resources for the thousands of people forced to spend the night outdoors. According to David Satter, a long-time correspondent in Moscow for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times who believes the Ryazan incident was a failed provocation, the broadcast only serves to increase the public¬ís misgivings.

In the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the DOJ, among the recent batch of hacked emails released by Wikileaks, we learn that the day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary‚Äôs campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik , who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. 
Peter Kadzik, with lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta . 
The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee . 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta‚Äôs home, another email shows . Another email sent on May 5, 2015 , Kadzik‚Äôs son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
As the Daily Caller notes , the dinner arrangement ‚Äúis just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state‚Äôs email practices.‚Äù As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúcozy relationship‚Äù with the Obama Justice Department. 
The hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta‚Äôs birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik‚Äôs son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
‚ÄúThe political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don‚Äôt think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,‚Äù says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
‚Äú It‚Äôs the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton ,‚Äù he added, comparing the Podesta-Kadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. 
Kadzik‚Äôs role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
A Long, Friendly History 
Podesta and Kadzik have a long history, one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. As DC helps summarize, Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a ‚Äúfantastic lawyer‚Äù who ‚Äú kept me out of jail.‚Äù 
As the DC Chuck Ross notes, it is unclear to which case Podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison. But Podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. 
Richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. ‚ÄúHe did lie to me,‚Äù Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton‚Äôs chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that ‚ÄúKadzik was recruited into Marc Rich‚Äôs lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.‚Äù 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich‚Äôs pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich‚Äôs ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
Kadzik‚Äôs current role 
In his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation . 
In a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained ‚Äúthat special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest.‚Äù 
DeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynch‚Äôs appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obama‚Äôs political appointees ‚Äî a list which includes Kadzik ‚Äî ‚Äúare being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. ‚Äù 
It is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantis‚Äô questions. 
Kadzik‚Äôs first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. 
Kadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBI‚Äôs files of the Clinton email investigation.

A new analysis of strange modulations in a tiny set of stars appears to indicate that it could be coming from extraterrestrial intelligence that is looking to alert us to their existence. 
The new study reports the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 2.5 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky. The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely.

Top NATO & EU officials expressed anger at Spain‚Äôs permit reportedly issued to a Russian aircraft carrier group to take on fuel and supplies at Ceuta, a city with unclear political status. Spain says Russia‚Äôs warships have been mooring there ‚Äúfor years.‚Äù 
A barrage of harsh statements followed when Spanish media reported that Russia‚Äôs naval battle group led by aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov would make a stopover at the autonomous port of Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar on Wednesday. 
Battle Stations! Putin‚Äôs fearsome fleet locked, loaded & ready for war with Britain‚Ä¶ or not 
Russian ships would moor in Ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by Spain‚Äôs Foreign Ministry, Spanish newspaper ABC reported on Tuesday, also citing Defense Minister Pedro Morenes, who said that ‚Äúthere was a prior authorization for this particular case.‚Äù 
Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and currently EU envoy for Brexit talks with the UK, expressed his outrage, calling Spain‚Äôs decision ‚Äúthe harassment of EU and NATO forces.‚Äù 
In a Facebook post, he said that NATO member Spain ‚Äúprovides assistance to a fleet which has one purpose,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúonly last week this Spanish Government signed up to a statement from the European Council accusing Russia of war crimes against civilians in Aleppo.‚Äù 
Later in the day, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made it clear that the bloc wants Madrid to rethink the stopover permit. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
‚ÄúWe are concerned and I have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase Russia‚Äôs ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against Syria,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThis is something I have conveyed very clearly before and I repeat those concerns today and I believe that all NATO allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against Aleppo and Syria.‚Äù 
He then downplayed the rhetoric, noting that ‚Äúit‚Äôs for each nation to decide whether these ships can get supplies and be fuelled in different harbors along the route towards the eastern Mediterranean.‚Äù 
Late Tuesday night, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said it was ‚Äúreviewing‚Äù the decision. ‚ÄúThe latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from Russian authorities,‚Äù the ministry said in a statement, quoted by Reuters. 
Earlier in the day, however, the ministry told RIA Novosti that Madrid allows Russian ships to dock in Spanish ports as ‚Äúroutine navigation‚Äù which effectively lies outside EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. 
In the meantime, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry told the Telegraph the requests from the Russian Navy ‚Äúare considered on case-by-case basis,‚Äù stressing that ‚ÄúRussian navy vessels have been making calls in Spanish ports for years.‚Äù 
Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish enclave on the tip of Africa‚Äôs northern coast, lies along the Straits of Gibraltar and borders Morocco, which also claims the territory as its own. 
Although Ceuta is part of the EU, its status within NATO is still unresolved. Since 2011, Spain has rankled the bloc by allowing 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave. 
The mission of the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group has already triggered a media frenzy across Europe, with British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships as they round European shores through international waters. 
Once they reach Syrian shores, the ships will provide backup for Russia‚Äôs naval standing group already deployed to the area, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.

Around 300 civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the US-led coalition in Syria, which Amnesty International investigated for its latest report. Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State. 
Amnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, ‚Äúmay have‚Ä¶ carried out unlawful attacks‚Äù in Syria, failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings. 
‚ÄúWe fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,‚Äù said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International‚Äôs Beirut regional office. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.‚Äù 
Amnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM. 
The report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action ‚Äúcould be as high as 600 or more than 1,000‚Äù since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014. 
One of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
According to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors. 
‚ÄúAt this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him‚Ä¶ I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me‚Ä¶ My mother, aunt, wife and children ‚Äì a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I‚Äôd rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,‚Äù the survivor said. 
The strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area. 
Amnesty said CENTCOM‚Äôs failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive. 
‚ÄúGiven the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,‚Äù said Maalouf. 
A similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated. 
Last week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.

Samantha Bee is proof positive that being funny, clever, or photogenic are no longer requirements in leftist media. I guess we can call that progress. Problem is, whatever the size of Bee‚Äôs audience, there is still an audience. Which she lied to. Par for the course in leftist circles, but this one needs a rebuttal. Samantha Bee said ‚ÄúPartial birth abortion‚Äù is not a thing, while she ranted and raved at Donald Trump for his comments in the final debate . Sorry, Sammy. Partial birth abortion is sadly a thing‚Ä¶ 
Here‚Äôs what I find interesting: Bee‚Äôs need to explain away partial birth abortion shows just how unpopular the procedure is. She‚Äôs trying to get rid of it. Not unlike a woman hoping to chop shop her unborn baby . Of course she stops short of saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs a heinous, evil thing for people to do to their own children,‚Äù by excusing the sick, evil, twisted women (and the ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù who perform the butchery) who make it happen. Sorry, there is no reason to suck the brains out of a partially born baby for the ‚Äúhealth of the mother,‚Äù or ‚Äúif the baby has a terminal disease.‚Äù 
Abortion is always wrong. Like, always. 
Because chopping up a baby while it‚Äôs partially hanging out of the mother, its head still in the birth canal, because it‚Äôs ‚Äúgoing to die anyway‚Äù makes sense.

Wikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behind-the-scenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in American history. 
Remember the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and the conspiracy surrounding ‚Äúpodiumgate‚Äù ? 
Hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didn‚Äôt want to appear shorter than Trump. 
After the debate was over, however, a sneaky ‚Äúcleaner man‚Äù was caught on tape approaching Hillary‚Äôs podium multiple times, removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it. What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trump‚Äôs just after the debate officially ended. 
This led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. 
Well, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, it‚Äôs very possible. Why? A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Because apparently Hillary can‚Äôt give long speeches without a podium. 
In fact, these emails (and this isn‚Äôt even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture) prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept ‚Äúshort and sweet‚Äù unless Hillary has a podium. 
So how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90-minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow? 
Especially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing, looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates, as shown in the video above.

Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber ‚Äì the bureaucrat who once bragged that the ‚Äústupidity‚Äù of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place ‚Äì told CNN that the ‚Äúfix‚Äù for Obamacare was to impose a ‚Äúlarger mandate penalty‚Äù. CNN‚Äôs CAROL COSTELLO: ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?‚Äù JONATHAN GRUBER: ‚ÄúLook, once again, there‚Äôs no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty‚Äú‚Ä¶ Gruber‚Äôs arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. ‚ÄúObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,‚Äù points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn‚Äôt come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people.

But that doesn't mean that there won't be an attempt to steal the state's electoral votes.

One of Norway‚Äôs nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine Monday morning, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). [1] 
In a statement released today, the NRPA said: 
‚ÄúThe radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low.‚Äù 
Experts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology, in the southern town of Halden, were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. 
Said Per Strand, deputy director-general at the NRPA, a government regulator: 
‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want.‚Äù [2] 
The radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. 
Staff were evacuated from the institute, but later returned, donning protective gear, to assess the cause and extent of the leak, and halt it. 
A senior NRPA official said the incident would ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7. By comparison, the incidents at Fukishima and Chernobyl were ranked 7. [3] Source: The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
Regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today . Atle Valseth, a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology, agreed. He said: 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it wasn‚Äôt reported ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt good enough that we didn‚Äôt report it yesterday.‚Äù [2] 
Strand, the head of safety, preparedness and environment at the NRPA, expressed the regulator‚Äôs frustration. 
‚ÄúWe need to gather more information ‚Ä¶ But we are not happy with the situation, that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further.‚Äù [3] 
The Swiss Radiation Safety Authority (SRSA) said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility, which sits close to the Swiss border. 
Mark Foreman, a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel, which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramic-wrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. 
The iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall.

Nvidia has chosen to remove functionality from a Linux driver to ensure that it isn't more capable than the Windows version. This really doesn't sound like the action of a company that wants to get along well with Linux developers and users. So far, Nvidia hasn't indicated whether this is a temporary situation, or more likely a permanent arrangement.There can be one of two obvious motives for this, which amount to two sides of the same coin. Either Nvidia doesn't want to be seen to show up an embarrassing limitation in Windows or the Windows driver, or the continuing acrimony between the graphics firm and Linux is not over yet.While for most users three monitors are ample, making this a fairly niche problem, it's an example of a company manipulating the marketplace. Of course controlling the flow of progress in order to sell another product is nothing new - video games makers have been doing that since the 1980s.But to control the flow of progress to favour one platform over another is playing ""technology god"" and sets a disturbing precedent.

Last year, the number of deaths increased by 18% over the year before.A March 2011 earthquake and tsunami triggered multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japan's northeast coast, in what has become the worst nuclear disaster in history. A massive radioactive plume was released by the meltdowns, and the crippled plant has continued to leak radiation into the surrounding environment, including into the Pacific Ocean.A total of about 160,000 people were evacuated as a result of the Fukushima disaster. More fatalities on the horizon? According to data collected by the Fukushima Prefecture, 2014 saw 1,232 nuclear-related deaths. The two towns with the greatest number of deaths were both near the Fukushima plant: Namie, with 359 dead; and Tomioka, with 291 dead.The term ""nuclear-related"" means a death that does not result directly from radiation exposure but is caused by a disease later caused by that exposure. Indeed, it is radiation-related diseases -- including cancer, tumors and genetic damage -- that often cause the bulk of health problems and fatalities in cases of radiation exposure.One of the diseases particularly expected to show an uptick after the Fukushima disaster is thyroid cancer, because radioactive iodine from nuclear disasters tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland. An estimated 6,000 children contracted thyroid cancer following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. It typically takes four to five years for most nuclear-related thyroid cancers to manifest, and as that window approaches many Fukushima parents believe that their children are already showing symptoms. Fukushima officials have tested approximately 300,000 children and have turned up 100 cases of the disease, in contrast to the pre-disaster rate of one or two per million children.One parent concerned about her child's thyroid cancer risk is Megumi Muto. Muto's daughter, Nana, has been diagnosed with lumps in her thyroid gland, and the lumps are growing. Muto is certain that the tumors were caused by Nana's exposure to Fukushima radiation.""I feel angry,"" Muto said. ""I think the authorities hide the real dangers and now many more children are being diagnosed.""The health of both of Muto's children has deteriorated after being exposed to the radioactive fallout, she said.""They had rashes on their bodies then nose bleeds. My son's white cells have decreased and they both have incredible fatigue,"" she said. ""They may not have cancer now but they both have multiple nodules around their thyroids. I'm really worried."" Residents suing government Muto and about 100 other Fukushima residents are currently suing the local and national governments, alleging that the governments failed to protect their children during the nuclear disaster.This sentiment was echoed in a recent report, released by a parliamentary panel, which said that the Fukushima incident was, in part, a ""man-made disaster"" caused by ""government, regulatory authorities and Tokyo Electric Power Company,"" which were all lacking in ""a sense of responsibility to protect people's lives and society.""Because they do not trust the government's number, Muto and her fellow plaintiffs have conducted their own tests of the radiation levels in their neighborhoods. One test, conducted near a school in Fukushima city, registered radiation levels nearly 100 times that found in Tokyo.Those levels are high enough to warrant investigation, said plaintiff Sumio Konno, who has been a nuclear engineer for 29 years.""I have to investigate and inform the public of the facts, that is why I have become one of the plaintiffs of the court cases,"" Konno said. ""They're still not decontaminating areas where children live or near schools, even after four years.""

This crying ‚Äúchild‚Äù is supposed to make Brits feel guilty and demand their government allow ‚Äúchildren‚Äù like him into their nation.

Paul Joseph Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign circulated the name of one of Paul Ryan‚Äôs relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the House‚Äôs dislike for Donald Trump. An email released in part 19 of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and Hillary‚Äôs foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan on February 29, 2016. The piece draws attention to Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. ‚ÄúShe was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent ‚Äì that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair),‚Äù reads the email. ‚ÄúHer family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show *The Wire*) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.‚Äù Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican nominee‚Äôs campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan ‚Äì who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment ‚Äì has abandoned his support for Donald Trump?

NATO and Washington‚Äôs activities in Eastern Europe and the Baltics de facto amount to permanent military presence, Sergei Ermakov, a senior analyst at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, told RT, adding that we have seen ‚Äúonly the tip of the iceberg‚Äù so far. ‚ÄúEndless war-games and rotational deployments essentially amount to permanent military presence. NATO is testing a drastic military buildup. We have witnessed the alliance deploy expeditionary forces and assault troops to Eastern Europe. These are offensive, not defensive forces. What we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg,‚Äù Ermakov said. 
The North Atlantic Alliance has pledged to refrain from deploying substantial forces along the NATO-Russia border on a permanent basis, but has been increasingly active in the region. The bloc approved its largest military buildup in Eastern Europe and the Baltics since the end of the Cold War at the 2016 Warsaw summit, a development viewed with deep concern in Moscow. 
As part of this initiative, Canada, Germany, the UK and the US will establish and lead four battle groups expected to be deployed in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Each will total up to 1,000 soldiers. These battalions are said to become operational in early 2017. The alliance has justified its massive buildup by blaming Russia for its ostensibly ‚Äúassertive‚Äù behavior. Moscow has consistently denied these groundless claims. 
Ermakov further explained that forces of NATO‚Äôs European members are not as lethal as they might seem. ‚ÄúOn paper this is a force exceeding Russia‚Äôs [military] potential by several times. But it lacks real combat power. This is why Americans need to be everywhere. The US was forced to boost US European Command‚Äôs budget,‚Äù he said. 
Earlier this year, the Pentagon requested $3.4bn for its operations in Europe in 2017, a four-time increase compared to its $789-million budget this year. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Russian officials and experts have repeatedly pointed out that NATO increasing assertiveness has put regional stability at risk. 
The bloc‚Äôs muscle flexing and aggressive rhetoric ‚Äúgreatly reduce European security and the chances for a revival of constructive dialogue between Russia and NATO, something Russia has been calling for so many years. Instead, the bloc is doing its best to provoke an arms race with unpredictable results,‚Äù Peter Korzun, an expert on wars and conflicts, wrote for the Strategic Culture Foundation. Ermakov also said that the United States wants to increase its presence in the Black Sea region to counter Russia. ‚ÄúAmericans can no longer count on Turkey due to the failed coup attempt. Ankara has become a complicated partner. [Washington] is instead focusing on Bulgaria and Romania,‚Äù he said. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg mentioned Romania during a press conference held following the latest meeting of NATO‚Äôs defense ministers. He said that Romanian troops will join the US-led battle group in Poland. He also said that the ministers discussed progress made in strengthening NATO‚Äôs presence in the Black Sea region ‚Äúin the air, at sea and on land.‚Äù This initiative will include among other things ‚Äúa Romanian-led multinational framework brigade on land,‚Äù he observed, providing no additional information on the subject. 
Ermakov further said that Washington also wants to counter Russia in Central Asia and the Asia-Pacific region.

We have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between Chelsea Clinton and Doug Band back in 2011 after Chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Band‚Äôs firm, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department(see here , here, here and here ). 
The feud ultimately resulted in Band being forced to draft a memo spelling out, in vivid detail, the many entangled relationships between himself, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Fortunately, today‚Äôs Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band‚Äôs firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family‚Äôs private business endeavors. 
The memo starts with a brief background on Teneo, which was created in June 2011, shortly after Declan Kelly resigned from his position as ‚ÄúUnited States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland,‚Äù a position to which he was appointed by Secretary Clinton. 
In June 2009, DK Consulting was founded by Declan Kelley. Mr. Kelly served as COO of FTI Consulting until June 2009, when he stepped down and established DK Consulting. At that time, he also became the United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland . Pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with FTI and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the State Department, Mr. Kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients (Coke, Dow, and UBS) and one pro bono client (Allstate) . In late 2009, Declan retained me as a consultant to DK Consulting to help support the needs of these clients. In May 2011, Mr. Kelly resigned his Envoy position at the State Department. In June 2011, Mr. Kelly and I founded Teneo Strategies ; simultaneously, Mr. Kelly closed DK Consulting and shifted its clients to Teneo. 
Throughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office, I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation . This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally. 
In a subsequent section of the memo entitled ‚ÄúLeveraging Teneo For The Foundation,‚Äù Band spells all of the donations he solicited from Teneo ‚Äúclients‚Äù for the Clinton Foundation. In all, there are roughly $14mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being Coca-Cola, Barclays, The Rockefeller Foundation and Laureate International Universities. 
The donations from Dow Chemical are particularly notable for several reasons. First, because of other emails revealed by WikiLeaks and other FOIA requests, we now know that Dow Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris, was granted special access to then Secretary Clinton back in July 2009 at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another Clinton Foundation donor, Kuwait, over a failed joint-venture that would have netted Dow $9BN in cash . As Band notes in his memo, 1 month after being granted special access to Secretary Clinton, Liveris invited President Clinton and Band out for a day of golf. Moreover, shortly after his meeting with Secretary Clinton and golf outing with President Clinton, Liveris decided to donate $500,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative ‚Ä¶very convenient timing for all involved. 
In August of 2009, Mr. Kelly invited Mr. Liveris to play golf with President Clinton and me. Mr. Kelly subsequently asked Dow to become a CGI sponsor at the $500,000 level, which they did , as well as making a $150,000 donation to the Foundation for President Clinton to attend a Dow dinner in Davos. 
The story gets even more bizarre when Band reveals in the following footnote that Liveris provided the Dow Chemical plane to fly President Clinton and his staff from New York to California and then California to North Korea for their golf outing . We would assume this is a simple typo by Band and/or he‚Äôs just geographically challenged‚Ä¶if not, this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for Bill. 
Mr. Liveris provided the Dow plane to fly President Clinton and his staff to and from California for our trip to, and from, North Korea . As a private trip, the Foundation had to pay the costs of airfare; Mr. Liveris‚Äô in kind contribution saved the Foundation in excess of $100,000 . 
According to the Dialy Caller , Dow Chemical paid Teneo $2.8 million in 2011 and $16 million in 2012 for a variety of ‚Äúconsultancy services‚Äù. Of course, Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Teneo and, as such, was set to be paid $3.5 million for that position even though he ultimately only kept $100,000 because of the scandals that erupted around the firm, including their advisory relationship with MF Global. 
Finally, Band also offers the following commentary on the ‚Äú$50 million in for-profit activity‚Äù he was able to secure for Bill Clinton (as of November 2011) as well as the ‚Äú$66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements.‚Äù 
Independent of our fundraising and decision-making activities on behalf of the Foundation, we have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities ‚Äì including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements . In that context, we have in effect served as agents, lawyers, managers and implementers to secure speaking, business and advisory service deals. In support of the President‚Äôs for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family ‚Äì for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities (e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than $50 million in for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the $66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements). With respect to business deals for his advisory services, Justin and I found, developed and brought to President Clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject. Of his current 4 arrangements, we secured all of them; and, we have helped manage and maintain all of his for-profit business relationships. Since 2001, President Clinton‚Äôs business arrangements have yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements. 
A big part of those ‚Äúfor-profit‚Äù activities was a $3.5mm annual payment from Laureate‚Ä¶ 
‚Ä¶and millions in speaking fees arranged by Band.

If you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and ‚Äútemperamental‚Äù, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. 
She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. 
Someone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are ‚Äúgoing to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton‚Äù‚Ä¶ 
On Syria‚Äôs civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. 
Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and ‚Äúsafe zones‚Äù on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. 
‚ÄúWhat we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,‚Äù said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.‚Äù 
In order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. 
And in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. 
According to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences‚Ä¶ 
Russia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. 
‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,‚Äù Clapper said, speaking with CBS‚Äô Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. 
Of course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria ‚Äúwould require us to go to war‚Äù ‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúRight now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I‚Äôm not going to make.‚Äù ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) 
But Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. 
You see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn‚Äôt for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no ‚Äúhumanitarian crisis‚Äù in Syria at all. 
Thanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won‚Äôt have anywhere to hide. 
So the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. 
One recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates ‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúMrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation ‚Äì at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,‚Äù Putin said. 
‚ÄúNaturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,‚Äù Putin noted. 
Anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. 
And even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania ‚Ä¶ Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America‚Äôs troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. 
In addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia‚Ä¶ 
After accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. 
A rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. 
‚ÄúThe US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,‚Äù said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen S√∏reide. 
Most Americans aren‚Äôt aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. 
But in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation ‚Ä¶ 
Russian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. 
At the Kremlin‚Äôs Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. 
The country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. 
I know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. 
In my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn‚Äôt know how the election would turn out. 
At this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. 
If you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don‚Äôt do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. 
If the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years.

B ritain‚Äôs economy expanded by 0.5pc in the three months following the EU referendum, slowing down a touch from the 0.7pc growth recorded in the previous quarter but defying the most pessimistic predictions made by the Remain campaign. 
The country‚Äôs economic performance was stronger than the 0.3pc predicted by economists, and in line with the official forecasts made before the referendum took place ‚Äì in March the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted third quarter growth of 0.5pc. It also disproves the Treasury‚Äôs referendum campaign claim that a vote to leave the EU would r esult in 0.1pc fall in GDP in the third quarter that would herald the start of a recession. The Treasury‚Äôs worst-case ‚Äúsevere shock‚Äù scenario was even more pessimistic, predicting a 1pc fall in the three-month period. 
S terling rallied on the initial estimates from the Office for National Statistics, and economists said the unexpectedly strong numbers made it less likely that the Bank of England‚Äôs monetary policy committee (MPC) would cut interest rates at next month‚Äôs monetary policy committee meeting.

Sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean, mostly made up of fecal matter and trash. It‚Äôs where environmentalists come from. 
They are, effectively, the pits. Also, environmentalists hate people (see Top 5 Environmentalists Who Openly Support Killing Off Humans ). A side effect of being sad, soggy little bottom dwellers. So it‚Äôs no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in Montana , despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the town‚Äôs well being. Also electric cars , but whatever: 
The 2,300 residents in Southeast Montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anti-coal crusade launched by outsiders. 
An out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of Colstrip‚Äôs coal-fired power plant by 2022. The Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center, which sued the plant, see the closure as a victory. 
Plant operators came to an agreement with activists [because] Oregon Democratic Gov. signed legislation mandating the state be coal-free by 2030‚Ä¶ 
Consequences. 
It‚Äôs a win for everybody. Except the people employed by the coal plant‚Ä¶ Also, Colstrip‚Äôs entire economy. Coal plant workers make money, then spend that money at other businesses. Except now all those lads will be jobless, which means they won‚Äôt be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore, which means other businesses will suffer. Thanks environmentalists. 
By the way, ‚ÄúGreen Earth‚Äù SJWs tend to also be fans of the Indians . The people, not the baseball team. Racist. That wee tidbit is worth noting, considering how their eco-friendly plan isn‚Äôt very native-friendly‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúYou lose two of those units, and you are shutting down half the town,‚Äù Small said. ‚ÄúThis closure will have an economic impact on the reservations, throughout the County and across the State‚Ä¶‚Äù Small is of North Cheyenne descent. He‚Äôs made an extra effort to recruit American Indian students‚Ä¶ Nearly three dozen Northern Cheyenne work at the Colstrip plant, and three times that figure work in the coal fields. 
A double header. Bad for the economy, bad for the indigenous people. 
As mentioned above, the coal plant never stood a chance. Thanks to impending regulations, the plant has long seen the end drawing near. Possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to ‚Äútalk‚Äù them into seeing things their way. Whatever the reason, environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down. Now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy. 
Environmentalists happily stomped their cloven hooves all over people‚Äôs livelihoods. But hey, less smog. #Caring 
Also, man‚Äìmade climate change of the hot hots is a myth. Stop it.

Grinnell College is promoting a guide to help students avoid ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù this Halloween, warning that some costumes could be considered ‚Äúdeplorable and problematic.‚Äù 
The guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of ‚Äúcultural appropriation,‚Äù defining the term as ‚Äúthe act of displaying people‚Äôs cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner.‚Äù 
The guide, called ‚ÄúMy Identity, Not Your Costume,‚Äù goes on to list several examples of ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù Halloween costumes, featuring pictures of Grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture. 
In one instance, the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming ‚ÄúCall me Caitlyn,‚Äù referring to Caitlyn Jenner. The photo is held by a Grinnell student wearing a ‚ÄúNational Coming Out Day‚Äù pin, and includes a caption stating, ‚Äúthe misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture.‚Äù 
Another example of culturally appropriated Halloween costumes, according to the guide, is ‚Äúusing other cultures as accessories to appear more hip/interesting without adequate understanding or permission,‚Äù one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a Hindu deity being held by an Indian student and the message that such costumes are ‚Äúdeplorable and problematic.‚Äù 
It then warns students that if their costumes take ‚Äúdefining characteristics of another culture‚Äù without ‚Äúpermission, or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture,‚Äù then these costumes might be too offensive to wear. 
The guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a Halloween costume, asking, ‚ÄúDoes your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke?‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúWhy would I find your ‚ÄòHalloween costume‚Äô to be offensive?‚Äù 
Campus Reform reached out to Grinnell for a comment on the matter but did not receive a response in time for publication.

The name Peter Kadzik probably doesn‚Äôt ring a bell for many of you, although it probably should. This guy is a real piece of work, as an excellent article published earlier today at the Daily Caller demonstrates. 
Here‚Äôs some of what we learned: 
The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrat‚Äôs campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. 
The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state‚Äôs email practices. 
Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta‚Äôs birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik‚Äôs son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
‚ÄúThe political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don‚Äôt think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,‚Äù says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
Kadzik, who started at the DOJ in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. 
Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a ‚Äúfantastic lawyer‚Äù who ‚Äúkept me out of jail.‚Äù 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. 
‚ÄúHe did lie to me,‚Äù Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. 
Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton‚Äôs chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. 
To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. 
A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that ‚ÄúKadzik was recruited into Marc Rich‚Äôs lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.‚Äù 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich‚Äôs pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich‚Äôs ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the WikiLeaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. 
The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just a day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee. 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta‚Äôs home, another email shows . And in an email sent on May 5, 2015, Kadzik‚Äôs son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
I‚Äôll have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction. 
As head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. 
The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. 
Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation. 
Seems like a pretty important decision for a Clinton crony to make. 
The Justice Department declined to comment on the record for this article. 
Could the Department of Injustice have any less credibility?

Steve Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 
GOP nominee Donald Trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule Wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel, prompting one CNN reporter to accuse Trump of ‚Äútaking time out of swing states.‚Äù Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is again nowhere to be seen. 
CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash suggested that Trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states, yet Trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day. Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: ‚ÄúNo, not at all‚Äù https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
‚Äî CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
‚ÄúSo to people who say you‚Äôre taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?‚Äù Bash asked. 
‚ÄúI say the following: You have been covering me for the last ‚Äî long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I‚Äôve been doing this for weeks straight,‚Äù Trump responded. 
‚ÄúFor you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you‚Äôll ask me that question. I think that‚Äôs a very rude question, to be honest with you.‚Äù Trump exclaimed. 
Trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. 
While CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. 
Last month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. 
And in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. 
‚ÄúHer speeches are so short ‚Äì they don‚Äôt last long, they‚Äôre like 10 minutes and ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get out of here,‚Äô‚Äù Donald Trump said about her schedule. ‚ÄúGo back home and go to sleep.‚Äù This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 8:12 am Share this article";english;2016-10-27T17:25:33.295+03:00;prisonplanet.com;US;41475.0;Video: ‚ÄòRude‚Äô CNN Reporter Asks Trump Why He‚Äôs Taking Time Off To Open A Hotel;0.0;http://static.infowars.com/images/INFOWARS_stacked.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;conspiracy

CNN commentator Angela Rye on Wednesday blamed the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare for the newly announced double-digit premium increases in the president‚Äôs signature health care law. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just Hillary Clinton that needs to tackle this but also Congress,‚Äù Rye said on CNN‚Äôs New Day. ‚ÄúThe reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly, Alisyn, is because Republicans fell short of their promise to repeal, which is what they said they wanted to do, and replace.‚Äù 
Host Alisyn Camerota stopped Rye before she got any further and reminded her that President Obama had promised premiums would go down. 
Most states will see health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act increase by an average of 25 percent, according to data released this week by the Obama administration. Indiana will see its rates slightly go down, but other states like Arizona will see costs skyrocket by 116 percent. Members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the Obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans.   8:17  ";english;2016-10-27T17:45:09.501+03:00;prisonplanet.com;US;41475.0;Liberal CNN Commentator Blames Republicans for Obamacare‚Äôs Rising Premiums;0.0;http://static.infowars.com/images/INFOWARS_stacked.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;conspiracy

Local authorities in Calais claim that the ‚ÄòJungle‚Äô refugee camp has been successfully evacuated, but according to an RT crew at the site, a number of refugees and migrants apparently remain at the half-demolished camp. 
Unlike the previous days and nights, the demolition of the site on Wednesday for the most part passed off peacefully. 
‚ÄúThis is the end of the ‚ÄòJungle,'‚Äù Calais regional prefect Fabienne Buccio reported. ‚ÄúMission accomplished.‚Äù 
The statement may be as premature as the one made in the same words by then US President George W Bush after the Iraq invasion in 2003. RT‚Äôs crew on the ground reports that dozens of people remain at the camp. 
‚ÄúSoon after that statement was made we went inside and saw that there was either a massive blunder in terms of their public relations line or a lie. The camp was far from being evacuated and closed,‚Äù RT‚Äôs Harry Fear reported from the scene. 
On Thursday, Buccio warned that refugees arriving at the ‚ÄòJungle‚Äô camp in the future would not be offered resettlement, unlike those evacuated in recent days. 
‚ÄúIt is not Calais‚Äô role to receive all the migrants of Europe. We do not want to create a vacuum. We have asked [those newly arrived] migrants to disperse,‚Äù she said. 
Earlier in the day, about 100 migrants were seen filing past police officers overseeing the camp demolition, Reuters reports.   6:43  ";english;2016-10-27T17:45:13.140+03:00;prisonplanet.com;US;41475.0;Mission accomplished?

The number of wild animals on Earth could fall by more than two-thirds in the 50 years to 2020, according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats, hunting and pollution. The forecast could lead to major consequences for humans. 
The Living Planet Report 2016 says that animal losses are on track to reach 67 percent in the 50 years to 2020. The report‚Äôs authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline, citing a 58 percent plummet between 1970 and 2012. 
The researchers analyzed the changing presence of 14,152 monitored populations of the 3,706 vertebrate species ‚Äì mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles among them. 
According to the paper, the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging. Pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem.

‚ÄúHumanity‚Äôs misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats, pushing irreplaceable species to the brink, and threatening the stability of our climate,‚Äù said WWF‚Äôs director of science, Mike Barrett. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Animals across the planet are expected to be affected. However, rivers and lakes are the hardest-hit areas. Barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures. 
‚ÄúWe are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,‚Äù the Stockholm Resilience Center‚Äôs Professor Johan Rockstr√∂m said in a foreword for the report. 
The decline in wildlife, along with climate change, is part of the proposed notion of Anthropocene, a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on Earth‚Äôs geology and ecosystems. 
The notion ‚Äì which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time ‚Äì can lead to major consequences. 
‚ÄúThe richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse,‚Äù WWF Director-General Marco Lambertini said, as quoted by the Guardian. 
In fact, the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition, noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition. 
‚ÄúIncreased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources,‚Äù the report states. 
There does, however, appear to be some hope. Some species are beginning to recover, suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis. 
However, Barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place, society must largely change how it consumes resources. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôd like to think that was a no-brainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business,‚Äù Barrett said. 
‚ÄúThe report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúMy hope though is that we don‚Äôt throw our hands up in despair ‚Äì there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it.‚Äù 
The new report comes less than two months after a similar analysis found that Earth has lost one-tenth of its wilderness sites since the early 1990s.   6:41  ";english;2016-10-27T17:45:16.623+03:00;prisonplanet.com;US;41475.0;Dying out: Wild animal numbers could fall by 67% from 1970-2020, study says;0.0;http://static.infowars.com/images/INFOWARS_stacked.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;conspiracy

Steve   
A new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . 
The survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. 
The findings represent a four-point increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an all-time high for the past three decades. 
The poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are ‚Äúagainst‚Äù a ban on semi-automatic rifles, or ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äùas the corporate media refers to them. 
That figure represents a full ten-point increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. 
Just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semi-automatic ban. an eight-point decline on previous findings. 
In addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. 
In a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a ‚Äúparadox‚Äù: 
Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. 
The findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clinton‚Äôs position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. 
Hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. 
Clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankrupt‚Äìand eventually end‚Äìgun manufacturing in the United States.

Paul Joseph   A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being ‚Äústupid‚Äù. The email , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured ‚Äúmany black faces‚Äù. Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders didn‚Äôt care about black people. Budowsky is not impressed with Brock‚Äôs outburst, writing in the email, ‚ÄúBrock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with.‚Äù ‚ÄúI guess Brock‚Äôs plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie,‚Äù writes Budowsky. ‚ÄúI cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more self-destructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf,‚Äù adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad. The email once again underscores the Clinton camp‚Äôs paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with African-American voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could. Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as ‚Äúsuper predators‚Äù.

Britain is deploying troops, aircraft and armor in the biggest military buildup in Eastern Europe since the Cold War. 
The deployment, which was first floated in the press by UK defense chiefs on Wednesday, appears to have been prepared well in advance. 
It will see up to 800 armored infantry troops deployed to Estonia and Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter jets deployed to Romania in what appears to be a reiteration of the strategy of containment employed against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. 
France and Denmark will also commit more troops. 
On Wednesday, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon struck a belligerent tone in the Wall Street Journal when he warned that Europe ‚Äú is our continent ‚Äù and, as such, would be defended. 
While he claimed the force would be ‚Äú defensive in nature ‚Äù he pledged it would be ‚Äú fully combat-capable. ‚Äù A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
He denied the placement of small formations around the Baltic area are merely a ‚Äú trip-wire ‚Äù in case of the much-heralded, but hypothetical, clash with Russia. 
‚Äú This is a serious military presence, ‚Äù he said. 
Tensions have only just begun to subside after a fleet of Russian naval vessels bound for the Mediterranean Sea passed through the North Sea and English Channel. 
The passage caused a press frenzy in the UK, framed as though Russia was launching an invasion of the British Isles. The Royal Navy deployed destroyers to, in Fallon‚Äôs words, ‚Äú man-mark ‚Äù the vessels while the RAF overflew the ships with fighter jets. 
According to the Russian military, the naval group‚Äôs task was to ‚Äú ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the world‚Äôs oceans, ‚Äù as well as ‚Äú the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities ‚Äù of Russia. 
Britain‚Äôs deployment of troops, drones and aircraft is expected to begin in May 2018.

With less than two weeks to go, the race for the White House has narrowed as Hillary Clinton now has a three-point advantage over Donald Trump. 
That‚Äôs within the margin of error of the national Fox News Poll of likely voters. 
Clinton is ahead of Trump by 44-41 percent. Another one-in-ten back a third-party candidate and four percent are undecided. Last week she was up by six points (45-39 percent) and before that by seven (45-38 percent). 
The poll, released Wednesday, finds Clinton leads 49-44 percent in the head-to-head matchup. That 5-point advantage is at the edge of the error margin. She was up 7 a week ago (49-42 percent).

For at least the second time in the last several days, cameras captured Hillary Clinton‚Äôs eyes acting strangely. 
The behavior, which doctors have told The American Mirror appears to be ‚Äúdisconjugate gaze‚Äù ‚Äî a common symptom of increased intracranial pressure, or swelling of the brain ‚Äî was evident again during a rally on Wednesday in Lake Worth, Florida. 
Here are several more of the instances from today: 
Despite getting major coverage on The Drudge Report, no mainstream news outlet has covered the apparent issue with Clinton‚Äôs eyes. 
But the several instances over the last few weeks, and as recently as last Friday , have been enough for doctors to publicly call on Clinton to undergo a full medical example and release the results. 
‚ÄúMy rational self would say that they could have defused all this a long time ago by releasing her medical records and having her undergo the same type of neurologic exam that every high school football player in America who ‚Äògets his bell rung‚Äô on Friday night must undergo before he can suit up for the game next Friday,‚Äù Dr. John R. Coppedge, a surgical specialist from Texas, told The American Mirror . A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
‚ÄúShe needs a full neurology evaluation, neuro-opthalmology evaluation, MRI, cerebral venography and a lumbar puncture,‚Äù Dr. Gerald Gianoli, an expert in intracranial pressure, said to this news site. 
‚ÄúIt is possible that her status could be significantly improved. But at the same time, she risks demonstrating to the public that her medical problems are more serious than she has let on in the past.‚Äù 
Gianoli, who believes the condition could be the result of elevated pressure, which can cause other problems. 
‚ÄúIt can lead to blindness, deafness, progressive vertigo/balance problems, seizures/stroke and continued problems with concentration, memory and ability to mentally focus,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúIt could also lead to death if the lateral sinus thrombosis were to progress to include the opposite side.‚Äù This article was posted: Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 5:57 am Share this article";english;2016-10-27T18:55:04.007+03:00;prisonplanet.com;US;41475.0;MYSTERY: Are Hillary Clinton‚Äôs eye problems becoming more frequent?;0.0;http://static.infowars.com/images/INFOWARS_stacked.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;conspiracy

A Former CIA Agent's Story ¬´ on: Today at 11:42:10 AM ¬ª Kevin Shipp is a major whistleblower coming from a solid background as a courageous, decorated CIA officer and anti terrorism expert. He held several high level positions in the CIA. A 2011 New York Times article describes the shocking details of Shipp's harrowing personal story of seeking justice and eventually turning whistleblower after his health and the health of his family were severely compromised.Running into the juggernaut faced by so many whistleblowers, Shipp ended up with both his marriage and his career destroyed. Yet in the end Shipp prevailed and managed to stay out of jail. He now speaks openly about both his own personal experiences and how the system works to silence and punish whistleblowers, and in so doing keep corruption and illegal activities at all levels covered up.Shipp's excellent essay below explains in detail why so few whistleblowers have come out on highly illegal activities related to Pentagon corruption, CIA manipulation and overthrow of governments, 9/11 shenanigans, secret mind control programs, and much more. His words show just how much courage it takes for people like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange to expose major government corruption. By spreading the word and calling for clear strong laws to protect whistleblowers, we can make a difference.With best wishes for a transformed world,Fred Burks for PEERS and WantToKnow.infoFormer White House interpreter and whistleblowerSilencing WhistleblowersBy Kevin ShippWhy don¬ít more ¬ìwhistleblowers¬î come out to expose illegal or unconstitutional secret government operations? If these activities are so illegal, why are people not coming forward to report them?Over the last fifty years US government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex, sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee, including his or her family, who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operations.As a condition of employment, military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a ¬ìsecrecy agreement,¬î or ¬ìnondisclosure agreement,¬î before being given access to the position, which offers high pay and status in the organization. This agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals ANY information regarding the program. Thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job, all employees eagerly sign it.This secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information, to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technology.However, because of the binding power of the agreement, government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations. It was the perfect tool to threaten, silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of government.Today, the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees. Annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement. These penalties include huge fines, termination, financial ruin and even prison ¬ñ all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families. Most will not reveal any wrongdoing, no matter how egregious, for fear of calculated, severe retribution.When employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs, they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial, or to sue the agency that hired them. If they try to do so as a whistle blower, they find they have no right to be heard in federal court. Many have found this out when their case was denied; then it was too late. That is part of the system.If the employee attempts to contact their Congressman or Senator, their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case, because they do not have the necessary ¬ìclearance.¬îWhen the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the Congressional intelligence committees, their response is ignored. It is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases, so they refer them back to their Senator or Congressman, who cannot access information involved in their case.If a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle, a system of personal and career destruction follows. This begins with promotions being denied, being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments, and their files being flagged, ruining their reputation inside their agency. At this point their career is over. If they go quietly, the retribution stops.When the employee still continues their effort to report the information, their travel records, personnel records, medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination. Their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information. If no substantive information can be found, it is fabricated and placed in their file.Employees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal ¬ìsecurity investigations,¬î multiple, hostile ¬ìinterviews,¬î attempting to get them to recant their information, and multiple polygraph interrogations.In many cases, the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation. If they comply, the evaluation labels them as paranoid, unstable, or disgruntled. This information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agency¬ís action in the event of outside scrutiny.If the employee contacts a member of the news media, they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them. Several news media outlets are connected to the CIA and NSA and notify them of the employee¬ís contact.Finally, the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against them.After termination or forced resignation, interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable. The release of the employee¬ís retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked (a felony). The agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors, further ruining them financially.Dehumanized, financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure, the employee¬ís family begins to break apart. If the family¬ís foundation is not strong, this results in alcoholism, depression and divorce. In some cases, it has resulted in the employee committing suicide, the ultimate goal of the program of destruction. This silences the employee permanently, obscuring the agency¬ís role in their destruction. It is the perfect crime.Should the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information, or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity, classified agencies will invoke the secretive State Secrets Privilege, which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison. If the family¬ís case reaches federal court, the State Secrets Privilege is invoked and the case is shut down ¬ñ and sealed. Federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case facts.Now that the employee¬ís case, and in some cases their family¬ís case, is shut down and under seal, citing ¬ìnational security,¬î the process of silencing the employee is complete. Many are never heard from again, fearing prison if they talk to anyone, including an attorney.Using attractive awards of multi-million dollar contracts, the US government military industrial complex convinces private corporations that their employees must be cleared and sign secrecy agreements. This includes employees at all levels, from secretaries to CEOs. Once they have signed the secrecy agreement, they are bound to keep all information, including potentially illegal information, quiet, being threatened with the same penalties.To date, over five million Americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the State Secrets Privilege.Only a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed. Sadly, some whistle blowers have died ¬ìmysterious¬î deaths or committed ¬ìsuicide.¬îEmployees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it, even to expose corruption. Most look the other way to protect their careers, retirements and families. Many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists. But, they are not fully aware of all that is being done. The full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees, until its use is necessary.This is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen. This system has been used and perfected for over fifty years. It is being used because it works.It works, unless the system is exposed, the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it, and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in government.This support is essential, not only to protect the whistle blower and their family, but also to defend our Constitutional form of government from tyranny.Kevin M.

As it happens, the Communists already had a leg up on them. We‚Äôll explore how this was done, along with some new twists.
The criticism and self-criticism technique in history This is what happens to people who joke about Chairman Mao ripping off Hillary‚Äôs wardrobe.
The technique of ‚Äú criticism and self-criticism ‚Äù (kritika i samokritika) was developed during the early days of the Soviet Union . This got results. When the early Soviet show trials and purges took place, the targets would confess to committing treason‚Äîthe details stretching credulity‚Äîand beg for execution. The Maoists (Chinese Communists) used it too, typically during ‚Äú struggle sessions .‚Äù Also, forced confessions were required in Vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps .
What happened wasn‚Äôt much different from a medieval inquisition. Those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did. Of course, physical forms of coercion were also an option. These weren‚Äôt actual trials; their fates were already decided.
The lucky ones were released and got to resume their lives as before, after their memorable reminder to toe the Party line. Others faced stiffer penalties than that: from loss of Party membership (and accompanying status) all the way up to execution. No amount of compliance or abject groveling could save them if it was predetermined that they were going to be purged or killed.
After the ordeal, survivors were surely scared witless. With their egos beaten down, they were ready to do as they were told without question. It‚Äôs basically a form of brainwashing. As for those who were executed after that, the purpose of going through the motions was for benefit of the audience. It was political theater, convincing those present that they were delivering justice to wrongdoers, and serving as an example of what could happen to those who step out of line.
Other than that, the ‚Äúcriticism and self-criticism‚Äù technique‚Äîbadgering and forcing a confession‚Äîalso was picked up in the USA during the 1960s by certain cults and oddball encounter groups. Today, we might think of these strange and humiliating rituals as a thing of the past, but the truth is that they‚Äôve merely changed form . As I‚Äôve noted previously , cultural Marxism is a crappy and inherently destructive ‚Äúfor-export‚Äù variety of Communism, so it‚Äôs no great surprise that it has adapted this technique for its purposes.
Modern witch hunts This is what happens to people who say that Bruce Jenner is actually a dude.
When people are encouraged to become incensed over even tiny things , this causes a ‚Äúwalking on eggshells‚Äù atmosphere. In today‚Äôs politically correct climate, it‚Äôs easy to run afoul of the Thought Police. This might result in a visit to the HR Department, or a campus ‚Äúspeech code‚Äù investigation. However, if the thoughtcrime is serious enough‚Äîor the target is prominent enough‚Äîthen this can ignite a media circus . Also, someone could end up featured on a mailing list for Social Justice Warriors . Besides just trolling and harassment, this can result in doxxing (release of your personal information) or pressure on an employer to fire the thought criminal.
We in the Western world pride ourselves on the right to free speech. That was one of the main goals of liberalism, back in the 18th Century when liberalism was still a good thing. Actually, many ‚Äúfree‚Äù countries criminalize politically incorrect speech. Even in places that don‚Äôt have legal penalties for speaking your mind, it carries the risk of the loss of your livelihood . This effectively makes entire policy arguments forbidden to articulate, which naturally is the whole point. Other goals, of course, are information control and thus thought control. So much for freedom of speech! It took a few centuries, but liberals now oppose what they once stood for.
The following scenario has happened time and again. Someone points out an inconvenient truth , writes something that offends someone, donates to the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù cause, mocks a feminist‚Äôs First World problems , tells an off-color joke , or even wears the wrong T-shirt . Then the feeding frenzy begins, resulting in torrents of criticism. Usually the target apologizes profusely, but loses his job no matter how abject or groveling his apologies are.
It‚Äôs possible to convince a judge and twelve jurors that you‚Äôre not guilty of something, but good luck getting the media or an online SJW mob to calm down and leave you alone! The traditional Communist session was better in one way. That is, they quit after breaking the target‚Äôs will. A modern feeding frenzy, though, can drag on for months, even after the target has been begging for forgiveness. What goes on the Internet can stay there forever, including lies about you.
If you get caught in a Social Justice Weenie witch hunt , never apologize. Explain and clarify if you absolutely must. This is for the benefit of the uncommitted; the SJWs will already have made up their small minds about you and won‚Äôt stop no matter what you do. Never let them break your frame! Instead, go on the attack. You have a right to your own opinion and to express it.
If you beg for their forgiveness, then you will be allowing them to turn their criticism into your self-criticism. Remember that groveling is unlikely to save you! Apologies are for people who actually did something wrong. Having a difference of opinion isn‚Äôt wrong, despite some people‚Äôs curious notions about freedom of speech.
Here are some other particulars to remember:
You can‚Äôt reason with them ; online mobs don‚Äôt know you and have been told that you‚Äôre an evildoer. You‚Äôll probably never know exactly what was said about you, who said it, and what email list all that was on. (If you do find out, sue for defamation of character.) However, you can be sure that you‚Äôve already been deemed guilty. They‚Äôre not interested in the truth. SJWs have great difficulty comprehending basic logic. Many of them don‚Äôt even believe in objective reality ; only their feelings are real to them. Why would the truth matter to these idiots? Finally, Social Justice Weenies are a bunch of losers . Their opinion of you matters less than that of a snotty child cursing you out. Therefore, don‚Äôt let these oxygen-wasters mess with your self-esteem. Societal criticism and self-criticism Wallowing in guilt at its finest
The Frankfurt School , a Communist think tank that moved to the USA and began subverting the educational system, developed critical theory . One of their top classics was Eros and Civilization by Herbert Marcuse. It contained lots of Freudian arguments on how our society was too repressed and we needed to loosen up our morals. Another was The Authoritarian Personality by Theodor Adorno. That too contained Freudian mumbo-jumbo, smearing right wing politics with accusations of neurosis and homo Daddy issues. All told, they wrote dozens of books along those lines, some attacking Western civilization directly. These vaporings wouldn‚Äôt have amounted to much, if they hadn‚Äôt become trendy in academia and influenced the 1960s zeitgeist.
Meanwhile, radical feminism‚Äîthe Second Wave‚Äîwas starting up. This too had lots of Communist influence , another front of cultural Marxism. This also was all about criticism of our culture. This caused friction between the sexes, driving a wedge deep into the heart of society. The results included the snarky, snotty, and spoiled attitudes you‚Äôve surely encountered. Worse, this caused untold misery from high divorce rates and broken homes .
This was one of several movements that became prominent during the 1960s and are still with us today. (Surely you can think of many others.) The methodology was the same‚Äîall angrily made overblown complaints about how bad society has been to them. The way they tell it, they‚Äôre out fighting for their rights. The goal of cultural Marxism, though, was all about attacking our morale and softening us up. The people involved in those movements were merely tools, being used by leaders who were in it for power, money, and status.
The educational system has been dumbed down . History has been rewritten too. Figures like Christopher Columbus and the US Founding Fathers are bad guys now. Even as early as the 1980s, campuses were hell-bent in purging ‚ÄúDWEMs‚Äù (their charming term for ‚Äúdead White European males‚Äù) from the literary canon. None of this was really about inclusiveness; it‚Äôs all about robbing our people of our heritage, making us ashamed of our accomplishments, and destroying our resolve.
The propaganda is everywhere. Television is full of social and political messages, even in shows for children , and piggybacked onto advertisements too. ‚ÄúSensitivity training‚Äù courses deliver politically correct indoctrination. College campuses are notorious for pushing propaganda. This even happens to elementary school kids. (My first exposure was in second grade.) Some of the indoctrination exercises require audience participation, such as forcing them to fill out ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù checklists (with the facts cherry-picked ) to instill a sense of ‚Äúcollective guilt.‚Äù
All this has worked according to plan. Many are out of touch with their roots, and don‚Äôt understand that they have a heritage worth preserving. Worse, others have been infected by guilt trips. Sometimes this leads to public spectacles of wallowing in guilt; again, there‚Äôs the self-criticism part.
The antidote to this is the truth. The fact is, every civilization has its good points and its bad points, and ours is no exception. It‚Äôs rotten hypocrisy for the bullshit merchants in academia and the media to dwell on our faults and overlook those of other parts of the world, while selectively ignoring our accomplishments and elevating those of others . The truth is that none of our shortcomings or misdeeds are solely found in Western civilization, but some of our good characteristics are indeed unique.
You can protect your children by home schooling them or sending them to a private school where they won‚Äôt be indoctrinated. You can always get rid of your TV too. Meanwhile, though, millions of other students will be putty in the hands of propagandizing professors and teachers, and of course the lying media. Those pushing this from the top down must be called out, exposed, and removed from power.

Trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it. The media went berserk claiming that Trump was undermining democracy. But is the US system really rigged? And if it is, can Trump overcome it?
Why rig the system? The elite realize that their time is short.
Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Revelation 12:12
It is human nature to want to accumulate wealth. It is also human nature to want to keep what you have. One of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them. A democratic republic is particularly easy to influence. The wealthy elite can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs. They can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the country‚Äôs demographics. Or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control. In the US, the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system.
For example, liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less. It sounds like a populist policy but it is not. Progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate. Progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down. That‚Äôs why no matter which political party is in power, we are still stuck with progressive taxation.
Everything goes well as long as both parties don‚Äôt rock the boat. But once you get a true wildcard like Trump, the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order. That‚Äôs what we are seeing now. The elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure Trump does not upset their gravy train. The elite sense their time is short.
Voter Fraud 
The first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud. In his Gettysburg address, Trump outlined some of the ways in which this occurs:
According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations that in the US that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate. 1.8 million dead people are registered to vote, and some of them are voting. I wonder how that happens? 2.8 million people are registered to vote in more than one state. These are numbers folks. These are numbers. 14% of noncitizens are registered to vote.
Liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement. They say that it negatively affects minority voters, who may not have any identification. But this is obvious nonsense. The real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult.
By raising concerns about voter fraud, Trump is firing a warning shot. He is saying that he will fight voter fraud, unlike prior GOP candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side. Simply putting the Democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise. The only question is whether Trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place.
The L√ºgenpresse 
A second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media. These include the three oldest television news networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) as well as the newer ones (CNN, MSNBC, Fox). It also includes the remaining newspapers, especially the New York Times, Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. Of these, the only ones that are reliably conservative are Fox and the WSJ, both of which are owned by Rupert Murdock. But even here, it is more accurate to call Fox and the WSJ ‚Äúneoliberal‚Äù rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade.
Trump is very media savvy. He‚Äôs been in the public eye since the 1980s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity. Trump has used this to highlight his policies. By making controversial statements, he has been able to force the media to cover his positions. Still, the nonstop smear campaign has hurt Trump‚Äôs numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources.
New media outlets like Return of Kings, Breitbart, and Danger & Play have been more favorable to Trump but the most highly funded new media such as Daily Beast, Heat Street, Buzzfeed, and Huffington Post all push the globalist message. The end result that Trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side.
Voter Discouragement Fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage Trump voters.
Another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage Trump voters from going to the polls. One way they do this is to over poll Democrats to make it look like Trump is losing. For example, one recent poll placed Hillary 12 points higher than Trump. But even Obama was only able to beat McCain by 7 points even though he was packing stadiums of 70,000 people. And Hillary doesn‚Äôt command the sort of adulation that Obama did in 2008.
There is a huge motivation gap between Trump and Clinton. Recently, Trump held a rally in Tampa where 28,000 people showed up. Some of these people waited in line for 12 hours for the chance to see Trump. A day later, Hillary hosted a rally in Florida where only 1000 people showed up. And some of those were likely paid plants. Her running mate Tim Kaine did even worse barely getting 30 people to show up for one of his events.
One day before the Brexit vote, polls showed Remain leading by 10 points. Leave ended up winning by 3.5 points.
Why does the legacy media report polls that show Trump losing by a landslide? Because it is designed to dishearten Trump voters.
Conclusion Will Trump be able to overcome the rigged system? It will be a heroic achievement if he does. One thing is certain: This is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might. The elites want us to be discouraged, to give up hope, to lie down and die. That is the one thing we will never do. Even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you, go to the ballot box on November 8th. Regardless of what you may hear otherwise, your life will be very different under President Trump than it will be under globalist pawn Hillary.
Win or lose, our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on November 8 th . A Trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open. A Hillary victory, heaven forbid, would signal that our work will need to be underground. Either way, our battle is just beginning. In future columns I will outline the way forward for traditional men.

7942;c6349400101c8ad0453ba1ef38b561305a2413c2;0;Andr√© du P√¥le;2016-10-27T20:01:14.275+03:00;4 More Emotions Men Should Master;"Last week I expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions . These matter much in prompting us to take action or not to, to think about something or not to. Sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls, ignore our own needs, or refraining from caring about our own interests, whereas others push theirs every day. They can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after short-term pleasure, or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and finger-waving against men of their own kin.
Pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking. Rather, it is the exact opposite, as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons, as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotion-determined actions. Once we have gained awareness of passions, we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why.
Following this idea, I made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy, hope, and love. Today I will do the same with four other passions or emotions: admiration, shame, humility, and fear.
1. Admiration 
Society, I think, should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions. Women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta males‚Äîas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundaries‚Äîhence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical, uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor. Of course, this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy, unmanly men: women should also be trained into validating more manlier men. And here admiration comes into play.
As Nassim Taleb put it, we are living more and more in an ‚Äúextremistan‚Äù where those at the highest level take the lion‚Äôs share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder. Girls today tend to admire only the most famous or high-status people, which leads them to despise the ninety-nine per cent. This exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man, as long as he achieves the minimum and/or is upstanding and dutiful, gets his fair share. A more ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù but still conditional distribution of girls‚Äô admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition .
Girls should also admire‚Äîand not mock‚Äîproper feminine role models. Upstanding mothers, females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl.
2. Shame 
Shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short. If our actions fall short and we fail to notice, we can ‚Äòbe shamed‚Äô or made to notice‚Ä¶ Shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed, but, unlike embarrassment, also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others. (Neel Burton, Heaven and Hell , chap.4, p.38)
A particularly strong emotion, shame usually comes as a blow, makes one lose face or composure, to eventually feel guilt or remorse. Just like other strong emotions, it has been used with consumed malignancy by the Left.
Leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery, the Holocaust, an oppression of ‚Äúminority‚Äù groups, or ‚Äúracism.‚Äù As these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded, whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt. The sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up: being shamed as a ‚Äúracist‚Äù or ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù can be enough to endure rejection from one‚Äôs family, lose reputation and employment.
Shame can be aroused through two levers: the standards one agrees with, and one‚Äôs purported responsibility. Both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberal-favored groups. As for the standards, feminists attacked what they called slut-shaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior, and as for the responsibility, pretty much all those who claim to identify with a ‚Äúminority‚Äù tend to deny all by slipping it over the majority‚Äôs shoulders.
This is how you get persistent offenders or Jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse, whereas the productive, working, and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white. In the Current Year, better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading Europe than a young virgin of European descent.
What we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice, as people evidently hate being shamed, especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others.
Shame the fatties , shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious, recall the self-determination of anti-white liberals and criminals. They all made free choices. They should carry all associated responsibility.
As for us, we must keep our face straight, never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical SJWs. If they appeal to moral standards, put forth your own as legitimate. If they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility, emphasize theirs‚Äîand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors.
Even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn: likewise, granting certain people or groups a constant de-responsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything. Criminals of said groups have agency, and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well.
Shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable. The liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens, in spite of how much the latter to house the former, allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terrorists‚Äîwhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ‚Äú-ist‚Äù or ‚Äú-phobic‚Äù acquaintance.
Turn the table. Shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority, and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long.
3. Humility 
Current Year girls‚Äô overinflated ego is enough, notwithstanding economic or racial factors, to explain a host of social problems. Blinded by it, girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings, short-term desires, or by the latest fashions around. They drink loads of booze, fuck with random strangers, reframe their story as a ‚Äúrape‚Äù later so they can blame it all on the guy . They never learn to cook, clean, take care of something else than their Instagram account and corporate career. (Speaking of corporate: isn‚Äôt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment, sex, and have almost nothing, whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can have‚Äîtake‚Äîit all?)
Ego makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance. It leads to complacency, merciless exploitation of others, refusal to take responsibility, and open despise.
Augustine of Hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues. This makes sense. If one‚Äôs ego is inflated, one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomings‚Äîthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else. Ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury, parce que je le vaux bien , as says a famous brand of cosmetics, instead of focusing on self-improvement or caretaking.
Though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed, as the survival of basic family units depends on it, bloated ego is a general disease in our age. Men too can be sold the idea that, say, being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak, dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves. It‚Äôs not all about our individual selves.
4. Fear 
Readers asked for it, so, here it is. Fear is a very powerful emotion, to the point of prompting one to freeze, flee, abandon a previously planned course of action, or never even think to consider an idea or an action. The Left has been using it in two different, albeit complementary, ways.
First, it has constantly accused conservatives to ‚Äúplay on fears,‚Äù implying irrational or unjustified fears, when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment. When the 1965 Immigration Act was voted, democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of America and that any suspicion it might happen was ‚Äúhighly emotional.‚Äù In France, the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations. Here the Left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable ‚Äúfear.‚Äù
Well, what happened since? Doesn‚Äôt it look like every ‚Äúfear‚Äù from the right was justified‚Äîespecially since the post-WW2 Right has always been incredibly wary, not to say coward, when it came to criticize the Left‚Äôs moral high ground?
Second, the Left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do, namely, stirring fear about political bogeymen. Liberals invented ‚Äúrape culture‚Äù or ‚Äúpatriarchal oppression‚Äù when men actually became weaker. They associated to ‚ÄúNazism‚Äù any white person who assumes his race should basically survive. They shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call ‚Äúwhite supremacists‚Äù as if defending one‚Äôs right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being Hitler himself.
Whites were led to fear their own supposed ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù tendencies, as the shrewd Jews who intrigued through the Frankfurt school put it (see Kevin MacDonald, Culture of Critique , chap.5). Whites were led to fear some of their fears‚Äîbetter have one‚Äôs daughter killed by Muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites, because racism is so evil, boo.
When I was younger, I noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people: they were much more fearless. They had this devil-may-care, provocative attitude, which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females. Not incidentally, the first movie of the French essayist Alain Soral Confessions d‚Äôun dragueur (‚ÄúConfessions of a Womanizer‚Äù) shows a young Arab with decent pick-up experience taking a young middle-class white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity.
Feeling fear is a necessary step in life. Fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard, but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability. Never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being ‚Äúfearful‚Äù or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fear-mongering.
On the flip side, being feared by others is not always a negative. Some people need to be afraid to respect you: if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity, they will harm and exploit you. Such people, just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect, should be kept in check by a minimal fear. Better be feared and respected than getting tread upon.
Conclusion Frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to, as you have to. The left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing: when we fail, whatever the reason, we are despised as weak or ‚Äúlosers,‚Äù and when we succeed they say we are ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù and ‚Äúoppressive.‚Äù In both cases, the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us‚Äî no matter what we actually do .
Fortunately, it is always possible to turn the tables, provided we keep a tight frame, and change these emotions as well. For example, when we are weak, we should elicit empathy, be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities, and when we are strong, we should elicit admiration and trust.
Think, frame, feel positive about us and about what we do. Get rid of those who won‚Äôt.

1. You have no idea how much you are eating. 
Ever wonder why you can‚Äôt gain any muscle or lose any body fat? Well, the first place to look for the answer is your diet. Are you eating the requisite amount of calories for your goals? If you want to gain muscle you have to eat more calories than you burn, whereas if you want to lose body fat you have to eat fewer calories than you burn. There is no way around this simple fact. Even though this is nothing more than a grade school physics problem, I‚Äôm still baffled by the number of guys out there whining about being ‚Äúhardgainers‚Äù or ‚Äúendomorphs.‚Äù Invest in a food scale and track your intake. It‚Äôs really not that hard. 
2. You are constantly looking for the next best supplement to take. 
This is the game equivalent of asking for the one magic pick up line that will allow you to swoop top shelf girls left and right. The hard truth is that the vast majority of supplements are a complete waste of money. Guys flock to supplements because it‚Äôs an easy fix. Instead of putting in the time and hard work needed to obtain the results they desire, they look for shortcuts in order to get ahead. Unfortunately, these shortcuts don‚Äôt exist. The only time you should be worrying about supplements is when you have all of the other nutritional building blocks in place. 
3. You think you don‚Äôt have the time to eat healthy. 
A lot of guys complain about being too busy to eat nutritious meals made mostly of whole foods. Guys will also complain about not having enough time to hit the gym after work (or during their lunch break). The problem here is not one of time , but rather of priorities . Guys would rather sleep-in than get up early to make themselves a good lunch to take to work. The bottom line is this: if you value your health then find the time to make yourself nutritious meals. Ditch the excuses. 
4. You think there is one ‚Äúbest‚Äù diet for everyone 
I‚Äôve been in this game long enough to know that there is no one particular diet that is best for everyone. I remember about 10 years ago people were losing their minds over The Atkins Diet. About 5 years later people moved on to The Paleo Diet, and now Intermittent Fasting is all the rage. New diets will always be on the horizon, which pretty much guarantees that arguments on the internet about which diet is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù will never end. I do not know what the ‚Äúbest‚Äù diet is. What I do know is that all good diets have several things in common such as being based around whole foods, and acknowledging the importance of portion control, protein, fiber, and other important nutrients. Aside from these basics, whether you eat low carb or high carb, three meals a day or six meal, is entirely up to you and your lifestyle but make sure you get the basics down first. 
If you can get a handle on just these four areas of your nutrition you will be ahead of the vast majority of individuals out there.";english;2016-10-27T23:16:43.640+03:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;Comment on 4 Reasons Why Your Diet Sucks by The Most Important Concepts The Manosphere Taught Me;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

The most interesting books of the Bible for those who aren‚Äôt believers in God are the wisdom books of Job and Ecclesiastes. Written from a philosophical point of view, they attempt to help people live with suffering and pain while putting existence into context.
Book of Job 
Job is a devout believer in God who follows all of His rules. He has been blessed with incredible wealth and numerous children. Satan then challenges God by arguing that Job is only faithful because of what he has gained, and that he would immediately curse God if everything was taken away from him. God allows Satan to destroy him, taking his wealth and killing all of his children.
Once the misfortune befalls Job, his wife implores him to curse God, but Job refuses. Instead, he openly laments at why God is allowing him to suffer. He even asks God to allow him to die.
I would rather be strangled‚Äî
rather die than suffer like this.
I hate my life and don‚Äôt want to go on living
Oh, leave me alone for my few remaining days. (Job 7:15-16)
Why make me your target?
Am I a burden to you?
Why not just forgive my sin
and take away my guilt?
For soon I will lie down in the dust and die.
When you look for me, I will be gone. (Job 7:20-21)
What do you gain by oppressing me?
Why do you reject me, the work of your own hands,
while smiling on the schemes of the wicked? (Job 10:3)
He then has a series of poetic dialogues with priestly men in an attempt to explain God‚Äôs justice. Job asks some pointed questions, implying that those who are eager to sin seem to experience more prosperity than those who closely follow God‚Äôs words.
The godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine,
its branches spreading across the garden.
Its roots grow down through a pile of stones;
it takes hold on a bed of rocks.
But when it is uprooted,
it‚Äôs as though it never existed! (Job 8:16-18)
When a plague sweeps through,
he laughs at the death of the innocent.
The whole earth is in the hands of the wicked,
and God blinds the eyes of the judges.
If he‚Äôs not the one who does it, who is? (Job 9:23-24)
Just like how there are so many laws in the legal code that you are always on the hook for something illegal, there are also so many possible sins that it may be impossible to live a clean life.
Whatever happens, I will be found guilty.
So what‚Äôs the use of trying?
Even if I were to wash myself with soap
and clean my hands with lye,
you would plunge me into a muddy ditch,
and my own filthy clothing would hate me. (Job 9:29-31)
The men that Job spills his guts to state that he‚Äôs sinning in some way and knows nothing about how God works, and that he must grin and bear it instead of questioning God‚Äôs actions.
Pay attention to this, Job.
Stop and consider the wonderful miracles of God!
Do you know how God controls the storm
and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds?
Do you understand how he moves the clouds
with wonderful perfection and skill?
When you are sweltering in your clothes
and the south wind dies down and everything is still,
he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror.
Can you do that? (Job 37:14-18)
God appears and asks Job how dare he question His actions, even though those actions amounted to an agreement with Satan.
Who is this that questions my wisdom
with such ignorant words?
Brace yourself like a man,
because I have some questions for you,
and you must answer them.
Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
Tell me, if you know so much.
Who determined its dimensions
and stretched out the surveying line?
What supports its foundations,
and who laid its cornerstone
as the morning stars sang together
and all the angels shouted for joy? (Job 38:2-7)
God goes on to describe his powers and then serves a ‚ÄúHow dare you?‚Äù argument to Job, who then accepts his utter impotence.
Then the LORD said to Job,
‚ÄúDo you still want to argue with the Almighty?
You are God‚Äôs critic, but do you have the answers?‚Äù
Then Job replied to the LORD,
‚ÄúI am nothing‚Äîhow could I ever find the answers?
I will cover my mouth with my hand.
I have said too much already.
I have nothing more to say.‚Äù (Job 40:2-5)
You asked, ‚ÄòWho is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance?‚Äô
It is I‚Äîand I was talking about things I knew nothing about,
things far too wonderful for me.
You said, ‚ÄòListen and I will speak!
I have some questions for you,
and you must answer them.‚Äô
I had only heard about you before,
but now I have seen you with my own eyes.
I take back everything I said,
and I sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance.‚Äù (Job 42:3-6)
Other parts of the Bible channel Job by asking why bad on Earth is allowed to continue:
Wake up, O Lord! Why do you sleep?
Get up! Do not reject us forever.
Why do you look the other way?
Why do you ignore our suffering and oppression?
We collapse in the dust,
lying face down in the dirt.
Rise up! Help us!
Ransom us because of your unfailing love. (Psalm 44:23-26)
And the usual response is to not question God:
What sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator.
Does a clay pot argue with its maker?
Does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it, saying,
‚ÄòStop, you‚Äôre doing it wrong!‚Äô
Does the pot exclaim,
‚ÄòHow clumsy can you be?‚Äô
How terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father,
‚ÄòWhy was I born?‚Äô
or if it said to its mother,
‚ÄòWhy did you make me this way?‚Äô (Isaiah 5:9-10)
After Job stopped questioning God, he was rewarded with even greater prosperity than before:
So the LORD blessed Job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning. For now he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 teams of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. He also gave Job seven more sons and three more daughters. He named his first daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. In all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of Job. And their father put them into his will along with their brothers. Job lived 140 years after that, living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren. Then he died, an old man who had lived a long, full life. (Job 42:12-17)
You have to be patient with God:
Those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy. They weep as they go to plant their seed, but they sing as they return with the harvest. (Psalm 126:5-6)
The lesson of this story seems to be one of stoicism: accept your fate, don‚Äôt question it, and understand that what you have now can be taken from you at a moment‚Äôs notice if God wants to, no matter how cleanly you have lived in his honor. Ironically, this book did more to make me question God‚Äôs wisdom than any other.
Book Of Ecclesiastes 
The next wisdom book is Ecclesiastes, purportedly written by King‚Äôs David son, Solomon, who amassed one-thousand wives during his reign as King of Israel. His wife collection led to him serving other gods, and he was punished for it when God broke up the Kingdom of Israel. Ecclesiastes is the book that Solomon wrote at the end of his life, sharing all that he learned.
‚ÄúEverything is meaningless,‚Äù says the Teacher, ‚Äúcompletely meaningless!‚Äù What do people get for all their hard work under the sun? Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes. The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again. The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles. Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea. Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content. History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new. (Ecclesiastes 1:2-11)
What is the point of accumulating wisdom in life? Why work hard?
For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. (Ecclesiastes 1:18)
I thought, ‚ÄúWisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness. For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.‚Äù Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate. Both will die. So I said to myself, ‚ÄúSince I will end up the same as the fool, what‚Äôs the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!‚Äù For the wise and the foolish both die. (Ecclesiastes 2:13-16)
So what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety? Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief; even at night their minds cannot rest. It is all meaningless. (Ecclesiastes 2:22-23)
All is vanity:
For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. (Ecclesiastes 3:19-20)
Promiscuous and bad women are sent forth as a punishment from God:
I discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death. Her passion is a snare, and her soft hands are chains. Those who are pleasing to God will escape her, but sinners will be caught in her snare. (Ecclesiastes 7:26)
Solomon tries to convince himself that evil will not prosper, but he can‚Äôt help coming back to the fact that it does:
When a crime is not punished quickly, people feel it is safe to do wrong. But even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time, I know that those who fear God will be better off. The wicked will not prosper, for they do not fear God. Their days will never grow long like the evening shadows. And this is not all that is meaningless in our world. In this life, good people are often treated as though they were wicked, and wicked people are often treated as though they were good. This is so meaningless! (Ecclesiastes 8:11-16)
At this moment, it seems that Solomon goes off the rails by seemingly promoting a life of debauchery:
So I recommend having fun, because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat, drink, and enjoy life. That way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work God gives them under the sun. (Ecclesiastes 8:15)
One interpretation of this is that if you live in sin like Solomon, you will eventually come to the conclusion that life is meaningless, all is for naught, and the only purpose is to have fun. The book may have been included in the Bible to serve as an example of what will happen to you if behave as Solomon and come to the end of your life thinking that it wasn‚Äôt worth it. I hope this was the intended result because otherwise it would cause you to lose faith in God‚Äôs own wisdom in justice, just like with Job.
The wisdom books of the Bible raise questions of God‚Äôs justice and plans for his human subjects. Why do people suffer or prosper? Why does life feel like it‚Äôs not being guided by God? These questions vexed the Jews enough that they honored other Gods to get more immediate results. And then Jesus Christ came along to say that it will all be worth it‚Äînot necessarily now, but in the eternal afterlife, as long as you accept him as your savior.

David is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel. He despises political correctness, which replaces real, needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal. Though still a young man, he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness, combined with a determination to help make things better. He tweets when there's something worth tweeting here . October 28, 2016 Girls 
Forget the movies that set aloof men against love-seeking women. It is men who are the hopeless romantics much, if not most of the time. And they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them. Though feminism, demographic trends, and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas, men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modern-day princesses. 
Of course, there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors. A time and a place, for example, can be found for defending a woman, most notably your mother or wife, from someone else‚Äôs verbal or physical attack. Likewise, sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a high-quality woman who gives long-term value to your life. That said, in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary, time-consuming, resource-draining, and plain self-destructive for a man. 
So, here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women: 1. Fighting for them 
I lost count long ago of the number of times I have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight (usually deserved) against her. A girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant, club or elsewhere, picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron. Along comes Captain-Save-a-Ho, who might not even know the girl, to protect her honor. The expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough, let alone when a man does it of his own volition, without being requested. 
In return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people, the white knight invariably gets a smile, a few words, and perhaps a phone number. From this point onwards, though, the interaction between Mr. White Knight and the Entitled Damsel Who Causes Her Own Distress invariably fizzles out. And it is not just members of your typical white knight crowd who act this way. Men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap, too, confusing it with the opportunity to be ‚Äúalpha‚Äù and dominate over another male. The most common outcome, sadly, is that a woman‚Äôs very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion. 2. Fighting over them Not only is this bickering usually ill-advised, it is often exactly what she wants. 
This stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap. Whilst competition in life, including between men over women, should be largely encouraged, swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last Sunday‚Äôs leftovers on a Saturday, three days after the refrigerator stopped working. 
Remember: a woman can be attractive but, because of her attitude and behavior, have very little long-term value for you. Countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the good-looking girl, it must be worth it. That‚Äôs simply not the case in modern times. To boot, a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically low-yield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed. 
At best, the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times, if at all. And if they do manage to secure the girl for a long-term relationship, the pairing usually implodes down the track. The man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms, such as by being draped (divorce raped). 
In the meantime, the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again. Unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul, entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more. Everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves, rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity. 3. Paying for them What are you getting from the transaction with her? And yes, everything is transactional in male-female relationships. 
Unless you are completely sure you have claimed the world‚Äôs best girl for yourself (and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances), you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is. This may seem counterintuitive, especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status, achievements, and resources. But we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable. A man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of high-quality and gives him something back in return. On both these counts, most men are paying for dud deals. 
In every long-term relationship I have had, I have put less into the relationship financially, proportionally-speaking. Almost always, even the girl‚Äôs gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it. For dates and during casual relationships, too, I pay for a woman‚Äôs time about as much as she pays for mine, if not less. 
When relationships end, girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed. What matters, however, is how you conduct yourself overall. Only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her. When patriarchy returns, the male-female dynamic will alter. Before that time, be sure she does her fair share financially. 4. Shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them Meanwhile, he should be do everything else for himself. 
Unlike many other self-destructive behaviors concerning women, this one can be very incremental and hard to spot. It is very easy to procrastinate on your work, final exams, self-development goals, and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a high-quality woman comes along. In fact, nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a drug-like dependency at the beginning of a courtship. In addition to these problems early on, men are apt to continue the shelving of their other, more personal demands after the relationship is well established. 
On a topic I will explore in more detail in another article, there should be certain hours in many days (or simply days in general) in which women do not even enter your mind. Contrast this with your average man, who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl. And often she‚Äôs not his girl for much longer, as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind. By devoting yourself to a ho, you become dispensable to a ho, not just psychologically, but physically, financially, and socially as well. Don‚Äôt let yourself rot 
Your body, finances, education, and other forms of self-improvement need to be your number one focus. After all, they are the only things you have (or don‚Äôt have) 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Individual girls may come and go, but your obligations to yourself remain. Paradoxically, keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place. A man who takes proper care of his money, career, body, and social life gets women. 5. Moving to them, for them Sucker. 
This is the one even my leftwing father warned me about. But it‚Äôs something a lot of guys are yet to learn. Like shifting or sacrificing one‚Äôs priorities, moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray. Every time I moved to where a girl of mine lived, I did so mostly for myself. Whether to explore a new country for three months, or find a new, refreshing place to get my work done, the relocation benefited me. This is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl. 
Perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her, he‚Äôs often left in the lurch. Don‚Äôt make this mistake. Either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that don‚Äôt revolve around her. If the relationship fails (and most of them do), you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in. Don‚Äôt follow the crowd of thirsty males Too many men slave away in a female desert. Girls are not non-existent, but they‚Äôre too often low-quality relative to what a man is willing to do for them. 
Snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off, too. You may not indulge in them regularly, but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there. More broadly, we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act. Become part of the solution.

His beliefs are summarized as ‚ÄúFrench Third Position,‚Äù basically a third party for those that reject the traditional left and right political views, and there have been Third Position movements in many European countries over the past several decades.
Major beliefs of Soral‚Äôs ideology include nationalism, political sovereignty, social conservatism, anti-globalism, anti-immigration, anti-feminism, anti-bankster, and a non-interventionist anti-war foreign policy. A major slogan of Third Position is ‚ÄúReconciliation‚Äù between the Labor Left and the Values Right‚Äîeconomic policy which values individual work and labor, and social policy focused on nationalism and traditionalism.
Early Life 
Alain Soral was born in 1958 in southeastern France. He attended a well-regarded private Catholic school, before enrolling in the distinguished National School of Fine Arts in Paris, founded in 1648, and later transferred to study under the philosopher and economist Cornelius Castoriadis, a famous 20th century thinker.
Castoriadis 
Castoriadis favored autonomous societies that are self-aware of their autonomy and independence, and believed societies should provide legitimacy for their laws and government actions. Historically, this was often done through absolute monarchy by invoking religion and God, with the monarch having a direct connection to the almighty (What God has commanded is what we must institute with the law).
Modern capitalist societies proved their legitimacy through circular tautology; that is they claimed that capitalism was logical and just, and therefore whatever a capitalistic society deemed profitable was therefore logical and just. A just autonomous society was always questioning and challenging its laws, but at the same time adhering to, respecting, and upholding the law.
Castoriadis described modern society as a struggle between creative imaginary and capitalist imaginary:
‚ÄúThe repetition of empty forms, of conformism, apathy, irresponsibility, and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of ‚Äúrational mastery,‚Äù pseudorational pseudomastery, of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption, that is to say, for nothing, and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary. The other road should be opened: it is not at all laid out. It can be opened only through a social and political awakening, a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy, that is to say, of the will to freedom. This would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary‚Äù
Post-University 
Soral loved books and knowledge, studying radicals from throughout the political spectrum. He was a dragueur de rue (street pick-up artist) when the PUA movement was virtually unknown. He developed a skill at attracting young, narcissistic, valueless city girls and claimed to bed hundreds of women, and published a book on game in 1996. His experiences with these women led him to develop strong anti-feminist beliefs.
He developed a strong dislike for the French Bobos‚ÄîBourgeois bohemians, younger wealthy highly educated narcissistic hedonists interested in fashion and trends. Perhaps something like rich hipsters, but less retro, more fashionable and trendy.
He joined the French Communist Party, motivated by his dislike of the bobos, and his camaraderie with the working man. The Communist Party, along with the Front National, were among the few opponents of the creation of the EU. Soral studied the works of Marx and other Marxists before leaving to join the far right Front National, where he was a speechwriter for Marie Le Pen. He noted that both Communists and Front National members were strongly nationalistic, and indeed many workers left the Communist Party to join FN around this time.
He became a strong critic of feminism and minority politics (gay, feminist, and Islamist or other racial multicultural groups). After Front National performed poorly in the 2007 elections, he formed Equality and Reconciliation , seeking to consolidate ideas on the left and right who believed in nationalism, patriarchy, anti-communism, anti-immigration, and anti-Zionism. E&R is an alternative news site, with some tendencies to the American alt-right, pro-nationalist, and critical of modern culture and feminism. He describes it as ‚ÄúLeft for the workers and Right for morals.‚Äù
He is a boxer, and since 2004, has coached boxing. He records videos, has a regular feature naming the ‚Äúcunt of the month,‚Äù and his works and website are very popular despite harsh attacks against him in the mainstream media.
Summary Of Views Trolling a feminist
Not much is available in English of Soral, and even English subtitles on his many videos are hard to find. I have but a cursory understanding of French, so I have relied on secondary sources and translations. His major beliefs are:
Anti-Feminism Views feminism as not pro-work, as women have always worked, but instead as anti-family and anti-mother. Discusses two classes of feminists: freaks and bitches. The real struggle is between rich and poor, not man and woman, who are naturally attracted to each other. He has attacked women‚Äôs magazines as altering the social conscience and relegating women to the status of objects. Stresses self-improvement and virility in men.
Anti-capitalism and anti-consumerism Opposed to valueless consumption and consumerism. In favor of bankster-free economics, and an end to the nanny state. Opposes ‚Äúdesire society‚Äù and the cult of celebrity.
Anti-imperialism Opposed to the Globalist Empire, and American Imperialism, attempting to spread its cultural, ideological, economic, social views everywhere and to destroy all nation-states.
Anti-Zionism Has attacked Jewish lobbying and intervention in French affairs. Made statements criticizing the Jewish people for being ostracized in societies around the world, throughout history, which earned him an immediate and harsh media blackout. He makes a distinction between French Jews and Zionism, saying that Zionists are opposing the interests of France and French Jews.
Anti-communitarianism Favors nationalism, not communitarianism. Calls communitarianism ‚Äúa poison.‚Äù Opposed to ethnic, racial, sexual, Islamist or feminist communitarianism, which is opposed to morality and national standards. Opposes the public effeminate, homo and transsexual society, and laments the lack of strong male role models. Makes a strong distinction between homosexuality and the Gay Pride community movement, which promotes drag queens, parties, vulgar parades, and hypersexualization.
Anti-vulgarity Opposes vulgar language, dress, and speech, especially in women. Has said he prefers publicly wearing the Muslim veil to thong underwear. Would go crazy at a Slutwalk. Critic of profanity and vulgarity; proponent of morality and modesty.
Islam Feels the ‚Äúmenace of Islam‚Äù is an artificially created and manipulated threat; primitive Islamic society is not a real threat to modern western states, and capitalistic globalist interests manipulate the region to destroy the anti-globalist anti-feminist culture of Islam, to foster animosity between social groups, to possibly create a clash of civilizations, or world war, leading to a full globalist takeover, and to loot Mideast nations, and that the fundamental values of moderate Islam are perfectly compatible with French moderate Catholic views.
Anti-modern culture and mainstream media Opposed to the decline in western values and culture, and the sorry state of mainstream media, who has labeled him a pariah.
Le Neo masculinit√© 
Many like-minded red pill men are turned off by the left-right politics in America. The third position combines right views on nation, morality, and law, with some left positions on social issues and economics. I believe if both the left and right hate you, you are probably doing something right. The ideas here strongly resonate with neomasculinity. Soral‚Äôs ideas are stimulating and interesting and definitely deserve further investigation.
An excellent summary of Soral and his beliefs is available here .

If you are a Western man under 30, your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography, epic divorce rates, hyper-sexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity, at virtually any age. You could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier, it wasn‚Äôt something remarkable and you‚Äôve both probably forgotten about it years later. You could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case.
While American culture evolved (or, as many fairly and convincingly argue, DE volved) into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals, statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws.
Federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent, instead leaving it to the states to codify. Though you are safe everywhere in North America by avoiding all girls under 18 and you may think that‚Äôs the law of the land, federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution. By the way‚Äîyou didn‚Äôt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her, right? Good thing you didn‚Äôt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography .
What is the age of consent in America? I wouldn‚Äôt even trust her (fake) ID.
The age for private consensual sexual acts in America ranges from 16 to 18 , sometimes lower in the case of married couples. It‚Äôs even lower in some foreign countries. By the way, say you‚Äôre an American student overseas with a foreign girlfriend who‚Äôs legal in her country, but still under 18‚Äîyou might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty.
Why is this significant? For starters, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child considers anyone under the age of 18 to be a child. That magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor. While US law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers, there‚Äôs no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to Cancun or studying abroad in Eastern Europe. The most likely situation for a young American male will be domestic, however.
Don‚Äôt take one for the team.
For example, back when you were 18 and your girlfriend was 15 and the age of consent in your state was 16, you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several times‚Äîperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents. You may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married, but more than likely you and she parted ways and haven‚Äôt looked back since.
Till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier. Thinking nothing of it, you tell him the basic details, admitting to sexual contact, and bam, you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor. Any defense of her consenting multiple times, or even that you did not know she was underage, is irrelevant‚Äîas a minor, she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges.
The long arm of the law may reach you. 
‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway, right?‚Äù Not so fast. First, if you have amassed any assets years later, she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages (although this is not always successful ) and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you. Even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you, having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume‚Äî just ask Bill Clinton .
Moreover, just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you, do not assume you are in the clear. Statutes of limitations can be changed , once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations. Any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game.
While the intent of changes to these laws is noble‚Äîthey want to nail child abusers who got away for decades‚Äîthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl, perhaps even if you yourself were underage. If you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged, the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction.
This applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though you‚Äôd nearly forgotten about it. If you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute, continue to keep quiet regardless. Prosecutors come and go, and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to re-open your case and pursue charges.
Branded for life. 
If you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time, you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry , perhaps for life. Say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely, resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you. Well guess what? You will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheet‚Äîit matters not that there was no conviction.
Imagine driving down the road years later, a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice. A sex offense arrest pops up. Think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny? What are the chances you‚Äôre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day? For better or worse, cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction, so it‚Äôs best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible.
You will get no breaks, so watch yourself. And STFU. Yes, of course, you both ‚Äúknew what you were doing‚Äù back on prom night. And yes, we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences . But you, sir, are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime target‚Äîdoubly so if you‚Äôre white, non-Islamic and attending college or boarding school, particularly a prestigious institution . Forewarned is forearmed.
Young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation. And if you‚Äôve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader? Don‚Äôt tell that story to anyone. Ever. The political climate is not favorable to you‚Äîand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check .

The idea that feminism is dead is gaining ground all across the west. One would like to think it is because of the trail blazing of the man-o-sphere, and to a great degree it is. But truly, the root of feminism‚Äôs death was in Man, capital M, from the very beginning. One look at Conan is all a man needs to know this truth. 
Feminism is dead. The movement is absolutely dead. 
The women‚Äôs movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long. There‚Äôs no room for dissent. It‚Äôs just like Mean Girls. 
If they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction. My wing of feminism‚Äîthe pro-sex wing‚Äîwas silenced. I was practically lynched for endorsing The Rolling Stones. Susan Faludi is still saying I‚Äôm not a feminist. Who made her pope? 
Feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women. You can‚Äôt talk to them about anything.

Neurotic women indeed. 
Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars/Prison Planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of 2014. But he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion. Feminists did not just lose the debate, they lost the war. 
The feminist attempt to demonize normal male/female behaviour in public‚Äî men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation ‚Äîbackfired in less than a month. 
When you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as Princess Leia, the QUEEN of 70‚Äôs patriarchal sexist ‚Äòmisogyny‚Äô, to ridicule feminists, you have lost the war for hearts and minds. 
And when I say hearts and minds‚Ä¶ I mean the silent majority of young women who want NOTHING to do with feminism. 
Leia makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys. So too will jawas, Darth Vader and even Yoda apparently, that sly dude. Who knew? 
And that‚Äôs a good thing! Men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship. Feminists may hate this, but the vast majority of women still prefer, and expect, the man to take the initiative to get the girl. This is how men and women were created and evolved, you can‚Äôt fight Darwin and God and come out on top. 
This video shows that the majority of NORMAL women LOVE male attention. They WANT men to look at them. They WANT men to notice them. Why? 
THEY WANT A MAN!!! 
I realized this is the case when I decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism . 
This image from the Women Against Feminism Tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism. This woman was raped. She is not running around spreading lies like the UVA RAPE HOAX story that Rolling Stone ran and had to retract . She justs wants to go back to living a normal life. She does not want to be angry at ALL men for the crime of ONE of them. She does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge. She does not want to be a victim. Feminists have lost the female youth of Millenials, the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the 21st century. 
I understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that Millenial men have become vocal, blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of ‚Äòwomen‚Äô it has reared . The problem with this type of knee-jerk reaction is just that‚Äîyou‚Äôre being a jerk. Yes, far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore. But, that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them. 
Young women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence (an illusion) easier for them to choose, but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society. 
Case in point. 
I met a wonderful young Russian blonde a little while back. Twenty-three. Tight. Feminine. So freaking perfect. We hit it off immediately on first contact. Having myself only traveled outside the west twice, I still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time I do, I am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls. As I conversed with this well educated and refined young Russian lady, she told me she was attending university and so naturally, I asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home. 
Her answer was revealing‚Ä¶ Boys? They completely ignore the girls. Don‚Äôt even look at them. Just walk on by. 
This really surprised her. Being a feminine Russian girl who expects men to look at women, this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her. 
Men, young boys, in their prime 20s, completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day. 
According to Wikipedia, women against feminism started on Tumblr in 2013 . I see #WomenAgainstFeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society. It is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage. All you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship, one with love and respect . I don‚Äôt think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is. 
As men, we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting, but offensive opinions. The very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism, and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate, is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into ape-shit, mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left . Here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a ‚Äògenerational‚Äô adjustment.";english;2016-10-29T23:51:47.390+03:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;Feminism Has Lost The Minds Of Young Women;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

And while that advice is still valid, I neglected a very important concept in that first article: the techniques that detail how to stretch.
I am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical ‚Äústretching mindset,‚Äù but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately. But before I can discuss those, I have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use.
How Not To Stretch Many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch‚Äî avoid this at all costs ! First and foremost, as I have discussed previously in these pages, you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue. They evolved solely to ‚Äúhold fast‚Äù and keep things in one piece, they should never be stretched at all!
The muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches, as they evolved to do. When stretching, your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving.
Even when you are positioned properly, no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch, as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away. This is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the ‚Äú anti-stretch reflex ‚Äù to prevent muscular tearing-stretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is, and your body responds to this stress with pain. This is a biological sign telling you that if you go further you‚Äôll be risking muscle tears, and should normally be a heeded warning.
However, if you want to do advanced stretching (such as that nigh-impossible benchmark of fitness the splits), you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself. And as luck would have it, there is!
Relax Into Stretching Reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practice‚Äîjust ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex! Similarly, your anti-stretch reflex that keeps your ‚Äújoints‚Äù (actually your muscles) stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques.
The most basic of these techniques is the one that I have had the best results with (as usual, the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one), and that is the titular concept of ‚Äúrelaxing into a stretch‚Äù‚Äîwith thanks to Pavel Tsatsouline for naming the concept.
To use this technique, take an easy form of the stretch you want to do: using the splits as an example, you would do a seated groin stretch. Engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle, and then‚Ä¶sit and wait.
Yes, paradoxically, relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context. You are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretch‚Äîin other words, you‚Äôre going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive.
This is not something that happens quickly‚Äîfrom my experience, it will take 5-10 minutes per stretch, so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch TV while doing this. As a side note, this is literally the only time where it‚Äôs acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise, in my opinion.
As you might expect, once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away, you can increase the stretch a little bit more, and hold it for another 10 minutes. Repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you can‚Äôt go any further‚Äîthis is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself, as I can‚Äôt judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop.
This technique can be utilized for any stretch, and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire. However, there are other methods in the ‚ÄúRelax Into Stretch‚Äù family of exercises that can be utilized as well, such as meditation‚Äîmentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation.
Or you can try ‚Äúforced relaxation‚Äù, where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching, forcing the muscle to relax.
Either way you slice it, don‚Äôt just brute force your stretching, utilize these techniques for better results.

A determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny - to save his country from postmodern collapse. October 30, 2016 Culture 
The global population in 1800 was about one billion people. Today it stands at over seven times that amount, with the rapidly growing populations of India and Africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years. Readers today are well used to the idea that the ‚Äúglobal south‚Äù is densely populated relative to its economic size and area, but this was not always the case. Prior to the collapse of Empire, Europe, having undergone thorough industrialization, was the most densely populated continent in the world. Source: ‚ÄúThe World at Six Billion‚Äù, United Nations, 1999.1950-2100 ‚Äì UN, Dept. of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2011) 
Europe was also where the world‚Äôs social justice movements‚Äîliberalism, communism and feminism‚Äîbegan, overthrowing the old order of kings, castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today. But why did this happen? Why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness, but instead lead to the emasculation of men, the breakdown of the family, and the disappearance of religion and morality? 
In these series of articles, I examine the root causes of this paradox, what one can do about it on an individual dietary level, and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level. I am a strong believer in social change through individual growth, and, having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies, I hope that others can benefit from my knowledge, and similarly make themselves into solid Men. Popular mainstream theories for social degeneration 
Many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degeneration‚Äîindustrialization, having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature, reduced their worth and attractiveness‚Äîor utility‚Äîin the eyes of women. Relatedly, others argue that technological progress, which increased independence and ability for all, allowed women to go their own way. 
Another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for discipline‚Äîr-selection versus K-selection‚Äîand so prosperous, disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters, fat off the success of their parents, who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses, leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness. One example of a short-sighted policy would be the feminist political movement, which artificially separated woman from man by giving her, through affirmative action, socially harmful economic independence. 
While all these explanations bear some truth, none of them delve into the deeply emotional, spiritual, human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration. Why the mainstream theories are flawed 
To begin with, a healthy Man and a healthy woman, even with modern technology at their disposal, should not so substantially less love and cherish each other, as seems to be the case today. The proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology: a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her. Even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone, Technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man. 
Further, the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoption‚Äîthe failure of Google Glass is the emblematic example. It does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for Slut Culture‚Äîthey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity. Anyone familiar with Russian or Japanese women, who have the same technology at hand, but a vastly greater sense of restraint and self-worth, can attest to this fact. Therefore, the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy, although it is certainly a necessary condition. credit: Ninaras credit: moguphotos 
To briefly examine the argument that Men no longer have (non-financial) utility in the eyes of women: a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks, or actually kills other people‚Äîinstead, being able to is sufficient. 
Therefore, the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master, man, remains and will remain eternally true. The change in technology and the nature of men‚Äôs work is not the causal factor‚Äîinstead, the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy. Men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman; and women do not respond to weakling men. 
Let us examine the r/K selection argument: if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically, it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny. This may seem like a truism today, viewed through the lens of the post-industrial, overpopulated Paris Hilton West, but in societies of the past, it was certainly not the case‚Äîrather, historically, the opposite has been true: the weak were poor because they were undisciplined, and the strong were rich because they were disciplined. The poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children, while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones, so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed. 
An extreme version of this disciplined-rich mentality can be seen in modern British farmers, many of whom, financially wealthy and prosperous, drive old, beaten SUVs, reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures. While it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate, this is, in my opinion, a (disproportionately visible) symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board. 
Therefore, I do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degeneration-I view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends, and not timelessly causal truths.int The population growth, nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration 
Having outlined and accounted for the above theories, I argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that makes up the society. This degeneration is caused by factors that affect the human organism on the basest level, and the two primary factors are: Nutritional depletion of food, caused by the growth of industrial agriculture, which itself is made necessary by unprecedented population growth. The pollution of the environment caused by industry and the introduction of unsafe technology. 
According to this view, it was not the Boomers‚Äô access to ease that made them such degenerate and irresponsible scum, but rather the fact that the rapid population increase during their key developmental years meant that the growth of industrial agriculture that somewhat necessarily accompanied it‚Äîthe Green revolution‚Äîcreated such nutritionally sparse food that there was insufficient development of Boomers‚Äô brains, leading to a generation of overgrown children. 
Further, according to this theory, the increased dependence on technology is not viewed as the cause of millennial autism, but rather a symptom of millennial autism. Recent historical examples 
Consider the historical path of Communism, which did not generally spring up in the villages. This was not because the landlords were better able to control the peasants, but instead because poor city dwellers, even if earning a higher income than poor peasants, had access to much worse food and lived in a far dirtier environment, making them both mentally and physically ill. The unfortunate result of insufficient mental development in a crisis situation ‚Äì our aim should be to save as many leftists as possible, and almost all can be. 
The poor in the countryside today continue to vote conservative or liberal, while the urban poor vote socialist, for this same reason: the rural poor, despite usually being less wealthy than the urban poor, are intellectually mature enough to see how harmful a controlling government can be. The urban poor mostly achieve the intellectual maturity of children or adolescents, and mostly feel rather than think, so they support an emotion-based class war or gender war ideology. 
This theory explains the early rise of social justice in Europe, where industrial agriculture was first adopted on a wide scale, and also explains why such movements did not organically grow anywhere else until much later, owing to the much later adoption of industrial agriculture. It should be noted that in the countries where communist revolutions were actually successful, they enjoyed no broad support, but instead were able to defeat the mostly pre-industrial historical governments because of these governments‚Äô economic weakness, and also because of extensive support by globalist or communist interests (this was true in Russia, China and Cambodia). Ancient historical examples 
This theory also explains the path of historical civilizations‚ÄîRome‚Äôs case is highly instructive. At its birth Rome was a small collection of largely self-sufficient, highly disciplined towns, where the diet, like in many towns of that era, was a mixture of grains, vegetables, small farmed meats (like chickens), and hunted meats‚Äîwhat we would call a balanced diet. In this society, men were the masters of their households, with power of life and death over their family members, while facing total responsibility for their family members‚Äô behaviour. Only a group of strong, capable and self-disciplined individuals could sustain such a social order. Population of the City of Rome; 1.0E6 = 1 Million Inhabitants ‚Äì Source: www.davidgalbraith.org 
Rome‚Äôs extreme martial and social discipline led to expansion. As it expanded and the city‚Äôs population grew, the diet for most people changed over time to mostly grains farmed highly intensively, shipped in from all over the Empire, losing a lot of its nutrition on the way. Simultaneously, and partly as a result of rising grain production, meat consumption fell, reducing the population‚Äôs testosterone levels, leading to falling strength and willingness or ability to compete, as well as rising mental illness because of copper overload. 
The weakened population‚Äôs increasing demands for emotion based socialism led to the growth of a massive welfare state, and eventual bankruptcy, hyperinflation and collapse of the central government. 
India is another equally tragic example. The population growth that resulted from highly prosperous Nanda rule led to the growth of Buddhism and the adoption of degenerate attitudes, moral collapse and eventually weakness to invasion. After the institutionalization of Buddhism by power-hungry and utterly Machiavellian psychopath Ashoka‚Äîwho looked to weaken the Brahmins, Hinduism‚Äôs traditional moral guides‚ÄîBuddhism‚Äôs degenerate vegetarian curse spread like a virus, and created, over several generations, a population of weaklings, who weren‚Äôt again able to assert their independence for over a thousand years. The Song dynasty followed a similar path as these two empires, being eventually overrun by the Mongols (the Yuan dynasty). Population of China ‚Äì Source: Vaclab Smil, China‚Äôs Environmental Crisis (1993) 
This degradation of the diet, caused by population growth, has been, at least, a significant causal element behind the degeneracy and collapse of most prosperous sedentary civilizations. The modern context 
The dramatic increase of the population since ancient times should help you understand why humans today are such fools and weaklings compared to our ancestors. There is only so much nutrition in the world‚Äôs topsoil to go around, and a population seven times greater than 200 years ago, eating a diet uncorrected (through nutritional supplementation) for dietary sparsity, will be living individually, in effect, 1/7 th the life that its ancestor population did. Is it any wonder that people today feel so weak and helpless that they want mommy government and daddy police state to give them the illusion of comfort and security? 
This theory is also borne out in the data: in general, food today contains ¬Ω to 1/10 th the nutrients it did in the 1930s, which was already about 50 years after the adoption of modern style industrial agriculture in the West. This dramatic fall in nutrition has accompanied the tripling of the global population, and close-to doubling of the European population, since that time. While some population control seems necessary, I believe that sustainable organic agriculture, combined with nutritional supplementation, should obviate a large amount of needed population reduction. 
I hope that the reader is, after consideration of these facts, sufficiently convinced of the true causes behind the modern world‚Äôs degeneracy. People have, fairly universally, across the political spectrum, become weak and insane from malnutrition. Artificial protein may have allowed some men to grow muscles, and calcium from an (over-)reliance on milk may have allowed them to grow tall, but perhaps the lack of most necessary nutrients has meant that they are generally still retarded, emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually. The effects on modern society 
This weakness amongst men‚Äîand dietary sparsity has disproportionately affected men, due to our much greater nutritional requirements‚Äîhas not just resulted in an inability to control the destructive forces that lie latent in every society. Worse, the fundamental outlook of men, who viewed themselves as the creators of civilization, the slayers of enemies and the protectors of women, all under God, has changed. The modern millennial man is a childlike hedonist who cares little for his civilization, culture or People. An aspiring patriarch. An example of testicular failure. Image credit: Giorgiomtb/Shutterstock Environmental toxins 
Environmental toxins are also a problem. Electrical, oestrogen and toxic metal pollution are under-researched but may have devastating effects on human health. Radio waves, plastics, unfiltered medication and purposely added toxins in the water supply, like fluoride and chlorine, have deleterious effects too. What can we do? 
Considering these realities, it serves little purpose to blame women for their self-destructive behavior. While in the past, like men, women used to have enough emotional maturity to try to live a life of self-respect (for example by remaining virgins and not drinking alcohol), they have never had much agency, charisma or true self will, even before the diet was empty, and before they were being stuffed full of drugs and chemicals by the unscrupulous pharmaceutical industry and its proxies. 
These poisons may cause serious and dangerous, (although slowly fixable) hormonal and behavioral changes, but the real effects are felt by their offspring. Unfortunately, once a woman is hooked on these drugs (for example, the birth control pill or antidepressants), she is unlikely to come off them, and if she does, she is unlikely to do anything to fix the damage to herself or her future children. This is especially the case as the medical industry, which has brainwashed her to see doctors and the state as her loving protectors, is unlikely to recommend it. 
Even so, these drugs don‚Äôt permanently alter the fact that women, as mostly emotion driven actors, are biologically and intrinsically people pleasers, and respond automatically to the most powerful person (or group of people) that can give them a raison d‚Äô√™tre. Even if we can‚Äôt ensure that women in general improve their diet and avoid pollutants, we can certainly make changes on an individual level, convincing or browbeating our girlfriends, sisters and mothers. 
The healthier a woman gets, the greater her affinity with nature becomes and the more maternal she feels, so you can be fairly certain that she‚Äôll try and pass on the knowledge to her children and friends, like our grandmothers and great-grandmothers did. Furthermore, there are a large minority of health conscious women, who it should be our duty to marry and impregnate as many times as possible. Considering the rapid population declines that will occur in the atheist and leftist segments of our countries‚Äô native populations, these women are our best hope for creating a viable future. You will have to teach her a few things. Credit: csp_Subbotina The situation is not hopeless‚Äîbut we have a fight on our hands 
In the past, well-informed people couldn‚Äôt expect, due to the limited, and elite-controlled, nature of communication technology and the educational system, to make any impact on the vast majority of the population. The political fight against Big Agra and Big Pharma seemed hopeless. Today is different: the growth of the Internet and the increasing spread of awareness has meant that more people are aware about the importance of eating well, avoiding environmental dangers and supplementing wisely. 
This is partly evidenced by the steadily rising percentage of people who eat organic diets, and the booming supplement industry. I hope that, in the future, at least a significant portion of us can survive in a sane enough state to politically fight back against moves by globalists, Islamists, communists and ruthless financiers who are circling, like vultures, over our degenerating civilizations. 
On the other side of this political battle, the globalist controlled medical industry has been the biggest proponent of unhealthy diets and dangerous and addictive drugs. Special interests have also been the biggest corrupters of regulators and the institutions created to defend the population against industrial and chemical pollution. 
A system of global monopoly wealth extraction is not possible with active, capable and self-confident masculinities from proud nation-states to resist it; those who seek to benefit from such a monopoly system have tried their absolute hardest to suppress natural health information. But so far they have failed, and the situation is only improving, so there is considerable reason for hope. Conclusion 
Our forefathers demanded to fulfill their destiny, ordained by the Gods, to defend our civilizations against the forces of rapacious greed and murderous atheistic villainy‚Äîto be the protectors and kings of our people. Today, most men are mentally ill and have become childish hedonistic narcissists. As expected, the ruthless and soulless have exploited this weakness for their own benefit. Now that you have, I hope, understood the principles behind why most of us have lost the urge to fight to protect our cultures, the cause and fix to the industrial malaise should no longer seem out of reach or impossible to grasp. 
This area of the human condition is just one another where we stand at the crossroads of history. But in my opinion it is the most important: if the dietary trend of the last two centuries is not reversed, and the nutritional quality of at least a significant minority of men is not substantially improved, then each generation of people will become more communist, more feminist and more weak than the last, and the globalist special interests that seek to create a totalitarian world-monopoly police state will win, regardless of temporary political victories. 
Each of us has chosen a path to follow in our quest for spiritual, intellectual and national salvation. This is mine. In my future articles I will detail the best dietary approach for strong men (and beautiful women) to follow, and overview the most important environmental precautions we must take, in our quest to fix the root causes of modern degeneracy. 
I hope that, ultimately, you are convinced to help me, and others like me, prevent our world from collapsing entirely into a miserable cyberpunk dystopia.

‚Äî Airbnb‚Äôs new SJW diktat 
Short-term residential accommodation network Airbnb is forcing its providers to adhere to a new ‚Äúnondiscrimination‚Äù policy , including a requirement to accept transgender people. The policy takes effect on November 1 and is accompanied by a slew of other recent or impending changes, which Airbnb says are designed to make its ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù more ‚Äúinclusive.‚Äù Those who refuse to accept the main nondiscrimination policy will barred from listing their properties with Airbnb. 
The major problem with Airbnb‚Äôs new nondiscrimination provisions is that they really just represent an euphemism‚Äîbowing to a customer‚Äôs feelings, rather than proven discrimination. The overall framework of the company‚Äôs policy alterations assumes that those accommodation providers accused of discrimination are actually guilty of it. This rush to judgment gives little or no recourse to those who depend on Airbnb to generate an income. It also makes it very easy for certain protected groups, most notably transgender people, to falsely or very loosely claim discrimination, when, in fact, the issue is likely to be the prospective guest‚Äôs temperament or perceived reliability in respecting the property. 
Secondly, the policy changes ignore the unique nature of sharing economy sites like Airbnb. Accommodation providers are often accepting guests into their literal homes, or their sole investment property. Whereas hotels have round-the-clock staff, including security, Airbnb properties are much more informal and unsupervised. Providers therefore have good reasons to be very judicious about who exactly they let into their residences. Airbnb‚Äôs ‚ÄúOpen Doors‚Äù policy treats any discrimination complaint as gospel truth Brian Chesky must‚Äôve drank the same poisoned water as fellow tech SJW Jack Dorsey of Twitter. 
We‚Äôll be implementing a new policy called Open Doors. Starting October 1st, if a Guest anywhere in the world feels like they have been discriminated against in violation of our policy ‚Äì in trying to book a listing, having a booking canceled, or in any other interaction with a host ‚Äì we will find that Guest a similar place to stay if one is available on Airbnb, or if not, we will find them an alternative accommodation elsewhere. 
‚Äî Brian Chesky, Airbnb CEO and co-founder 
In addition to dictating what kinds of guests can enter their providers‚Äô properties, another one of Airbnb‚Äôs new policies, which is already in force, treats those accused of discrimination as immediately guilty. Rather than determining whether discrimination has occurred, Airbnb has made it clear that it will bend over backwards to find those claiming discrimination other accommodation within its network or, more strangely still, alternative accommodation outside its network. The second arm of this ‚Äúdiscrimination response‚Äù will become very interesting indeed should privately-owned Airbnb decide to go public. It is hard to see how shareholders would acquiesce to a company offering customers third-party accommodation options that effectively deprive it of money. 
Airbnb is simply trying to have its cake and eat it, too. On the one hand, it wants to create as wide a market for itself as possible, now having providers offering 2,000,000 listings in 34,000 cities around the world. On the other hand, however, it wants to assume total control for determining what is and what is not discrimination, despite having no ability to verify pretty much any of the accusations. Airbnb are mere gatekeepers, providing a rudimentary service that makes its bucks by the sheer volume of providers. These same providers should not suffer because of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúthinly-spread‚Äù business model. Allegations of discrimination have been scant at best We don‚Äôt question the right of people to be selective about new housemates, so why not Airbnb providers and their guests? 
Various news articles reporting on the shift in Airbnb policies have only been able to point to isolated instances of even alleged , let alone proven discrimination. The best that SJW enablers can offer is a deeply flawed Harvard study, which claimed that prospective guests with stereotypical African-American names like LaToya and Darnell were 16 percent less likely to be approved by the company‚Äôs accommodation providers. Considering that a guest‚Äôs profile provides a lot more information than just their name, the Harvard ‚Äúresearch‚Äù leaves a lot to be desired. 
Moreover, names like ‚ÄúCletus‚Äù and ‚ÄúMary-Sue‚Äù would arguably garner even less approvals. Both these ‚Äúwhite‚Äù names and the aforementioned African-American names usually dovetail with some of America‚Äôs least sophisticated and worldly types, the exact kinds of people least likely to be allowed into someone‚Äôs home. It has precious little to do with race and almost everything to do with run-of-the-mill decisions about how to safeguard one‚Äôs own property by entrusting it to the right people. Such decisions are routinely accepted when new housemates are sought, so why not with Airbnb? Has Airbnb signed its own execution order? . @bookingcom is better than @Airbnb : cheaper prices, always instant booking, tons of apartment listings, better interface, and no SJW crap. 
‚Äî Roosh (@rooshv) October 29, 2016 
Just as Roosh swears by Booking.com, there are plenty of other options you can take in avoiding Airbnb from now on. Like Twitter, the company is quickly falling under the spell of the SJW crowd. It seems certain that, minus a backtrack, Airbnb and its reputation will follow Jack Dorsey‚Äôs company into the abyss. Unlike Twitter, though, Airbnb may never make the jump to publicly-listed company.

They used to fight against globalism (remember the anti-globalization movement?) even if their motives were different from those of today‚Äôs anti-globalists, as well as being against censorship, imperialist wars, and the expanding powers of governments and corporations. But today, you see leftists protesting against Brexit, attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment (using Twitter on their Apple products while sipping on their Starbucks coffee), and are calling for war in Syria to challenge the Russians. So, just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites?
To understand, we must go back to 2011 when the Occupy movement was ongoing. The Occupy protests, which now seem like ages ago, came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system. We can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them, but the important fact is that, to the elites, it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power.
The elites were in a panic as this was the first time in post-war history that the people of West mobilized in mass to threaten their rule. So, the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a full-blown revolution. And they already had a plan in mind: the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule.
The Diversion 
When the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed, the pressure will mount and it won‚Äôt go anywhere. The people want to vent out their frustrations. The elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up, so instead of fighting it, they prefer to re-channel that pent up energy elsewhere.
On February 2012, with the Occupy movement still raging, the elites were given that golden opportunity‚Äîor, rather, they created one‚Äîwhen a black teenager was shot dead in Florida: the none other than the infamous Trayvon Martin case. The shooter wasn‚Äôt even a full white, but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it; anything to divert the public attention away from them. With their efforts, it quickly became the biggest story of America.
But they didn‚Äôt stop there. Police shootings, which have always been happening and to all races, were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of Black Lives Matter movement‚Äîa movement that is financed by George Soros and others to stir up unrests across America.
Did the elites convert Occupy protesters into SJW patsies?
The diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the ‚Äú1%‚Äù who were dictating their lives. The Occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere. Although I don‚Äôt have as much proof as with the rise of BLM movement, I strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the Leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order.
The Strategy 
Back in 19th century, Karl Marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism. If we were to apply this concept to the world today, the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites.
The goal the elites is simple: divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power. Meanwhile, they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans. The worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one, so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible.
My understanding of their modus operandi is this: 1) Use hot-button issues to stir up controversy (something that doesn‚Äôt affect them like gay marriage, race issues, and all other politically correct nonsense). 2) Have the Leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the Right. 3) Let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each other‚Äôs throats. 4) When the issue fades away, foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process. By cycling through them over and over again, the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them.
Thus, we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites, women against men, Islam and atheism against Christianity, Left against Right, and so on, but no more anti-globalization, Tea Party movement, or Occupy Wall Street.
As long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists, sexists, and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate, socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government, nothing will change. As long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant, and getting in the way of creating a decent society, the people will remain divided. As long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals, the latest ‚Äúmisogynist‚Äù outrage, or how a lion named Cecil got shot, the elites will continue to win.
A Couple More Points To Consider I know they look like an occupying army, but there‚Äôs nothing to be alarmed about. They‚Äôre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the ‚Äúterrorists.‚Äù
First, while this article has been focused on how the Left has been toyed by the globalist elites, let‚Äôs not forget that the Right are not totally immune to their influence either. Remember how Neo-cons ( globalists puppets disguised as conservatives ) effectively lured the conservatives in America through faith and patriotism? The support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against Iraq based on bullshit evidences of WMD‚Äôs and Saddam‚ÄìAl-Queda link. While the Right has changed a lot since then, there are still ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù today who are itching for a war with Russia because‚Ä¶ USA! USA! USA! .
Second, it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule, it is not the end of it. The elites have far more sinister aims. By raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism, the elites are preparing for a total social control. I get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control.
No matter their differences, when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder, they‚Äôll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security. Europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the US government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens . A leaked Soros memo also reveals that the BLM movement is potentially being used to federalize the US police . While many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism, it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future.
The Culture Wars: Necessary Fight Or Engineered Distraction? 
The issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways, but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites.
On one hand, we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists, Zionists , bankers, mega-corporations , and the governments from undermining our existence. Really, do the issues of politically-incorrect Halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middle-class is being destroyed, revelations of massive corruption in the DNC, the coming police-state, and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world? All the drama of outrage and counter-outrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape.
On the other hand, culture does matter in many ways. Uncontrolled immigration, anti-male laws, and censorship are all very relevant issues. And as much of the Leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment, the situation isn‚Äôt exactly the divide and rule model I described above. In a way, we are now forced to fight the Left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites.
So, does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us? Or should we continue playing the elite‚Äôs games and bicker with their SJW drones? I don‚Äôt have a good answer, but whatever we choose to do, I believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on. We should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind.
Conclusion: Is There Still Hope? 
Although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization, the current US election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment. To me, that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class.
With Bernie Sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps, the only anti-establishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by Donald Trump. This is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down Trump and use disgruntled Leftists against his supporters.
I have my doubts about Trump , but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that Hillary Clinton will bring to America and the world if she gets elected. But besides voting, I believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us. We can‚Äôt constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us; we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny.

A reviewer of my new book Free Speech Isn‚Äôt Free also noticed this transformation:
I‚Äôve been following the ‚ÄòRed Pill‚Äô community for a a few years now. The members therein have been engaging in some of the most relevant conversations anywhere on the net. Roosh is one I‚Äôve only recently become familiar with as I tend to appreciate and relate more to the more traditionalist members like Vox Day, Dalrock, and Roissy.
What is so fascinating about guys like Roosh is how their journey to acquire more sex and attention from highly attractive women has led them stumbling across uncomfortable truths about the world that we men of the West find ourselves living in.
This book is a very straightforward account of an encounter that an iconic Red Pill pillar had with the traditional media community that exposes a truly shocking level of laziness and corruption on the part of an institution that we are supposed to respect for some reason. I remember watching from a social media distance as these events went down and I had no idea just how bad it was.
I really admire the stones on this kid and I hope he stays motivated and encourages more people to be bold with the truth (which is always unPC). I‚Äôm not a fan of lotharios but I appreciate intellectual honesty and bravery. I hope Roosh‚Äôs Neomasculinity gets legs. I really do.
How did game serve as the gateway drug? Simple: I kept asking why, as if I was an annoying 8-year-old child.
Why are woman attracted to me when I dance and act like an entertaining clown ? Why did my father not have to act like a clown to attract my mom? Why has society changed to encourage women to pursue exciting ‚Äúbad boys‚Äù and clowns over good men? Why are institutions like the media and universities pushing women into behaviors which harm them and the family unit? Why is there a concealed group of elites who seem to control politicians and the most important institutions? Why are those institutions attacking me for speaking the truth? There wasn‚Äôt only one step from having fun into the nightclub to fighting back against social justice warriors and the media, but several steps that had to take place over the past 15 years. My path weaved through sex and gender relations, but there are other paths as well, which I describe in The 5 Paths To Realizing Truth . For example, minimalism is another point of entry:
When you live below your means, you begin to see that most people are unnecessarily living above theirs. That leads to the conclusion that they were trained to live a life of excess by corporations with the complicit help of a government that wants to keep society in a neverending state of indebtedness and distraction so they ignore everyday injustices while losing any will or desire to fight the establishment. The easiest stepping stone out of The Truman Show is to realize that consumer lifestyles are not the path to happiness, and those those who chase material possessions are misguided.
Many other men have also had a similar path as myself, whereby promiscuous sex was a device for understanding the world and deciding on behaviors that are more sustainable to the male soul. While not every man gains wisdom during the stage of his life where he wants to sow his royal oats, many do, and they use that wisdom to devise solutions that can solve our modern problems. I do not at all regret engaging in shallow sex with many dozens of women throughout the world, because it has developed my thinking into what you read now, even though the sex itself wasn‚Äôt especially memorable and didn‚Äôt give me much except momentary pleasure.
From my current vantage point, it really does feel like it was all pre-determined, as if I was supposed to participate in shallow intimacy in order to arrive at true understanding, but that would imply some sort of divine providence. Whatever the mechanism, it‚Äôs clear to me that many of the behaviors and ideas we hold now could be mere way-stations for a grander, more universal truth. Whatever individual journey you‚Äôre a part of, I hope we‚Äôll find out soon enough.

In the beginning of the month women came forward accusing Trump of unwelcome advances. Later, FBI Director James Comey re-opened the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton after finding more government emails on pervert Anthony Weiner‚Äôs computer. But the most important event may be a meme campaign that highlights Hillary‚Äôs support forcing women to register for the selective service.
The meme campaign consisted of dozens of fake ads posted under the #DraftOurDaughters hashtag that highlight two very important policy points of the Hillary campaign: First, Hillary is a radical feminist. Thus she favors equality in all things‚Äîthat includes equality in combat. As a step in that direction, Hillary told the Huffington Post that she will support legislation to register for the draft.
Young women may think registering for the draft is not a big deal. They should reconsider because of the second policy of the Clinton campaign: She will almost certainly start a war against Russia‚Äîa war that will see those young women drafted into combat on the front lines.
Hillary has repeatedly blamed Russia for Wikileaks and she stated that she would get revenge through military action:
As president I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses .
The #DraftOurDaughters campaign could be the thing that brings down the Hillary campaign. To get elected, Hillary relies on two demographics: People of Color and liberal white women. Up until now, women have been able to support leftist social policy because it did not impact them negatively. If they become aware that Hillary intends to draft them into combat to fight a war with Russia, they may re-think the wisdom of their equalist position.
Here are some of the best examples of the #DraftOurDaughters campaign.
I feel this one is the most powerful. It clearly states Hillary‚Äôs intention to put women into combat and start a war with Russia. Unlike the Arab nations that the US has been toppling for the neocons, Russia has a formidable military and nuclear weapons. Any military conflict will not be short and easy. That means it will highly likely that young women will soon find themselves getting blown to smithereens if they elect Hillary.
The above three ads all target the weak, cowardly men who either support Hillary or the Never Trump cuckservatives. In the Alt Right, these men are frequently portrayed as being cuckolded by wives. Hence, they are often mocked for their wives having children who are not their own: ‚ÄúMy wife‚Äôs son‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy wife‚Äôs daughter.‚Äù
The ad below drives this point home even more forcefully. While women might encourage their men to vote Hillary or oppose Trump for being too alpha, they secretly despise the weakness of these men.
The following ads are directed to convincing women of the ramifications of their decision to vote feminist. Feminism taken to its logical conclusion means you are going to have to trade your Louboutins for combat boots.
 
Lots of the ads emphasize Hillary‚Äôs extremely aggressive stance toward Putin and Russia. She has blamed WikiLeaks on Russian hacking even though there is no proof that the Russians were to blame. And she and the Obama administration have been saber rattling against Russia in Syria.
The really frightening thing is that mainstream pundits are now starting to parrot the idea that the US must go to war with Russia. All the more reason to elect someone who is not controlled by wealthy donors like Hillary.
The ad below indicates that our ‚Äúenemy‚Äù Putin has a saner view on women in combat than the Democrats do.
While the campaign is mostly geared to point out Hillary‚Äôs intention to draft women, it also reminds men that their lives will not be spared in the conflagration that Hillary will start.
The media often portrays war as a sanitized affair. A soldier, safely positioned in a US-located command center, controls a drone that takes out the bad guys. The reality of war is that people from both warring factions die and are maimed. Once Hillary gets in, it won‚Äôt be just men dying in large numbers. Women will experience equality in having their lives snuffed out.
A final ad drives home the point that the future war with Russia (and Iran and Syria) will not be any sort of conflict against barbarism or evil. It will be for Hillary‚Äôs power trip. 
Conclusion Elections matter. For decades, women have voted for leftist policies that have put the burden on other people. If they are successful in electing Hillary, they will face the bitter consequences of their decisions. But unfortunately, they will not be the only people impacted. Thousands of innocent Americans, Russians, Syrians, and Iranians will also have to pay the price of their virtue signaling.
The #DraftOurDaughters campaign may be enough to wake some of them up from their folly.

It is true that at first glance, men dominate every field, from business to Pok√©mon Go achievements , which can lead some to think that there is a conspiracy against women. But the male superiority in many fields is exactly what allows society to prosper. Years after the humiliating debunking of the wage gap, it‚Äôs time to address the real elephant in the room: the fact that women don‚Äôt pay taxes.
A research report on the fiscal contribution of men and women across age groups was published by the Victoria University of Wellington . Let‚Äôs explore the key findings.
This is the well-known earnings gap (incorrectly referred to as the wage gap). Women‚Äôs preference for low paying jobs, among others, is a factor at play here. Another factor is the amount of women working part time. The average week for women, in this research, was 28.9 hours, and 37.2 for men. The workforce participation rate did not differ between men and women in significant ways.
This is the disposable income. This is the ‚Äùincome remaining after deduction of taxes and other mandatory charges, available to be spent or saved as one wishes.‚Äù You can see that progressive taxes unfairly impact males , and reduces males‚Äô disposable income near women‚Äôs, although the market income was almost double that of women‚Äôs. If it disproportionately affects men , you can be assured that no one will complain.
Those are the raw taxes paid by men and women. The tax gap has, oddly, never been an gender issue until now.
When the tax money received by men and women is included in the equation, you can see that for most of women‚Äôs lives (except between 44 to 60), they receive more tax money than they supply the state with. Men, on the other hand, give the state more tax money than they receive from 23 to 65 years.
This is where it gets upsetting. As you can see, women‚Äôs short period of positive fiscal impact doesn‚Äôt come close to counter-balance an already massive overall negative impact. ‚ÄùThe net fiscal incidence on men is approximately zero when accumulated over all ages.‚Äù As such, society invests in young males, and they subsequently pay back society‚Äôs investment. Women bear massive costs to society, while we were taught to see them as underprivileged.
By the end of her life, the average woman will cost about $150,000 to the average taxpayer. This means that an average man is extorted $150,000 in his lifetime that will be directly transferred to women. If men could use that money to their will, women would chase men as much as men chase women nowadays.
There are a few confounds that need to be ruled out. The authors mention specifically that health and education costs are almost equal for men and women. Also, the workforce percentage doesn‚Äôt exceed 10% difference between men and women. Women don‚Äôt spend more for children either, according to the report. Even if there were confounds that needed to be accounted for, this is not something feminists have done for the 77-cent wage gap. They have compared raw percentages without accounting for any confounding factors.
Also, these numbers do not include massive costs for the governmental budget for women‚Äôs issues, that is a massive burden for the state. For instance, my local government (from a Canadian province of 8 million people) just announced a $200,000,000 plan to fight sexual violence against women , after two immigrants ding-dong-ditched women in a student house .
Add to that millions invested in sex-ed programs, in which a feminist teaches boys that porn movies tailored for them shouldn‚Äôt be imitated, and that instead, that they should have their partner‚Äôs pleasure in mind, while teaching the exact opposite to girls. The government takes money from males to empower women into hating men and their contribution to society.
https://t.co/Rnb9rpFW3s Qu√©bec (Canada) announces 200$ million plan against sexual violence after two FOREIGNERS touched female students
‚Äî Nicolas Kilsdonk (@nkgervais) October 29, 2016 
The data also doesn‚Äôt include all the money directly and personally transferred from a man to a woman. For instance, while women make so little, they still account for 85% of all consumer purchases . And you were wondering why marketers so desperately try to appeal to women in advertisements.
A metaphor for male taxpayers and women? This is a real Danone ad. Watch it here or see my comment here .
The only defense that feminists can use, when confronted with these facts, is that women invest so much time in children. However, feminists made it very clear in the past decades that a woman‚Äôs contribution to society shouldn‚Äôt be based on her involvement with children. Moreover, at birth rates of half the necessary 2.1 birthrate for population stability, they‚Äôre also doing the children thing pretty badly.
These findings raise a serious question: would feminism survive a libertarian regime that doesn‚Äôt involve (male) tax money? After all, it is not a coincidence that women consistently vote for a welfare state. Within 10 years of women‚Äôs suffrage in the USA, the government doubled their tax expenditure and revenue . Women‚Äôs voting patterns have made the government become the new providing husband. But this time, the providing husband doesn‚Äôt get a woman or children in return. Remove taxes, and no woman will ever claim to be a ‚Äùstrong, independent woman.‚Äù The state is cucking you. A little like if prostitution was not only legal, but free . Most guys would probably be strong, independent single males.
Pretty ironic that the institution that gives money to women for being pregnant, prevents them from being paid less, makes abortions affordable‚Ä¶ is entirely supported by men. Feminists are not seriously against living in a society entirely supported by men, they are just against men having the autonomy over the wealth they create. Male wealth is a public good and female wealth is‚Ä¶ ‚Äùher body her choice.‚Äù
It‚Äôs time we fight for equal tax.

Could we see a repeat of that fateful event and perhaps a worsening of it soon to a city near you?
The election is the focus of every news channel ad nauseum. But few people are focused on the day after the election. No matter who wins this year‚Äôs presidential ‚Äúselection‚Äù the possibility of civil unrest the day after election day and beyond is a real possibility. Are you ready for chaos if it develops?
The nation is so divided we are likely to run into problems.
The ugliest scenario for the day after election day plays out if Trump wins. If Trump wins, get ready for Black Lives Matter, the Black Panthers, The Race (La Raza) and other racially motivated anti-white groups to come out and possibly start burning cities down again. After all, they have been given carte blanche all year long to do so in Ferguson, Baltimore, Charlotte, and San Jose . A worrisome precedent has been set.
Of course, Trump won‚Äôt be in power the day after election day (we have to wait until Inauguration Day for him to clean up any potential messes) so Barack Hussein Obama is likely to give the racial hate groups the green light once again while the media whips out their collective Stradivarius, plays my heart bleeds for thee, and sympathizes with the devils destroying the nation.
If The Bitch wins conservative groups may clash with leftists over rights being stripped away
If Hillary wins, there‚Äôs the real possibility of protests the day after the election, and the social conditioning of whites to be polite and docile even as they‚Äôre railroaded in what was formerly their nation may not hold this time around. A Hillary win means the chaos and possibly violence could wait until she starts stripping constitutional rights away. Then, we are likely to see conservatives finally come out and start raising some righteous hell. There could be racially motivated clashes on the horizon as white people standing up for themselves goes against a long-established narrative that they‚Äôre all evil racists.
Few people think of the effects civil unrest could have on their livelihood and well-being. It‚Äôs time for a little education on just how thinly stretched the American supply chain is, and what could happen with only a short-term disruption in it.
Here‚Äôs a scenario ‚Äì just one of many possible scenarios. Video of rioters stopping and then looting a semi tractor-trailer in Charlotte is worrying because if trucks stop, America stops. If attacks on truckers happen often enough, truckers may decide it‚Äôs not worth the risk to their lives to continue moving freight around and stop driving. Within a day, bedlam could ensue as the supply chain runs on a razor‚Äôs edge in modern America and everything from food to medication to gasoline starts running out.
Supply Chain Rioters broke into trucks on I-85 and burned cargo in Charlotte
According to the American Trucking Association (ATA) a disruption of 24 to 48 hours means hospitals and nursing homes would run out of food. Fuel supplies at gas stations would also run out in that time frame. Garbage would start to pile up. Most grocery and retail stores would start to run out of food and merchandise. ATM and bank cash supplies would also run out.
The tight rope the corporate system walks quickly breaks when merchandise stops moving.
As an example, the ATA tells us this is what happens during a hurricane. Imagine what would happen with days or weeks of rioting in major cities.
In a hurricane situation, supplies that would normally last a few days, such as water, powdered milk, and canned meat, typically disappear within one day. Given these inventory rates, this means that perishable goods could be depleted in a matter of days and non-perishables in just a few days. Runs on food and non-food staples during hurricanes, and even before big winter storms, provide a good example of how fast some retail inventories can be depleted during panic buying. The same quick depletion of inventories could occur if trucks stopped making deliveries for any reason.
Panic buying means no food on the shelves. When people don‚Äôt have food at home and then the grocery store doesn‚Äôt have food, rioting will intensify. Things could get ugly in a hurry as one small disruption leads to a domino effect, after which Bedlam ensues.
So, it is best to be prepared with non-perishable items just in case things get out of hand. Have at least several weeks food supply on hand. But, how do you stop people from coming and taking your stash?
Be Armed The police won‚Äôt be around to protect you if Bedlam ensues
Contrary to gun propaganda from the media , you absolutely want to be armed in the event the election and its aftermath don‚Äôt pass peacefully. What happens when stores no longer have food and gas stations no longer have gas? Gangs form looking for homes that do have those items.
They‚Äôre going to pick out the weakest home in the neighborhood and pounce.
A home with guns is a safe home. Just as this YouTube video shows , armed thugs may bust into a house looking for money or food, but they started jumping through plate glass windows and scrambling like cockroaches once the homeowner came out with guns blazing.
Several handguns with extra ammunition are advised. Know how to use them. Be steady with the trigger. And don‚Äôt be afraid to use them if looters come to your house.
The police will NOT be there to protect you as they‚Äôll have their hands full with the chaos.
Better To Be Safe Than Sorry The idea of an intact nuclear family may be a trite memory, but protecting your loved ones is still key
With the meltdown of America happening right before our very eyes, we are entering an unstable period in the nation‚Äôs history, to say the least. No matter who wins the election the nation we once knew and loved is passing away. Trump may be able to turn things around temporarily, but even if he does the country now has so many immigrants it will be impossible to assimilate them all.
We are entering a period in which America will resemble a third world country more and more. The demographics of the nation are being changed on purpose so white people are diminished at the ballot box and Democrats will gain a lock grip on the levers of power in the nation in the coming years . Divisions between rich and poor will grow, and the evil media will be there stirring the pot with racial, class, and gender division every step of the way . Peace will become a thing of the past as squabbling factions compete with each other for dominance.
In this transition from prosperity to despotism, it is best to be safe than sorry. The day after election day will be telling in that it will set the tone for the next four years. It may be a somewhat peaceful turn towards Communism if The Bitch wins, or it may not be.
But my money is on a steady degradation of civil society in the coming years. Tend your own garden, as I know I will be tending my own. My military friends are already discussing what will happen in SHTF scenario. You should be thinking about it, too.

Still, our political perspectives might be off-putting to some readers on the left. Although you could tune out whatever you don‚Äôt agree with. you might do well to take a closer look. Not all of us agree on everything, but we do have a rough consensus on some items.
Our views on the political establishment The left blames corporations while the right blames the government, when in reality the two interests work together to subvert the will of the people
It‚Äôs pretty easy to see that this site has a mainly conservative perspective, especially on social matters. Not all of us started out that way. Many of us began our journey away from the political orthodoxy after realizing what a mess feminism has made of society. Others have been turned off by political correctness. Once upon a time, I used to be liberal, and I know I‚Äôm not the only one. Be that as it may, some of us are actually friendly to liberalism .
By the way, we don‚Äôt give a free pass to the mainstream conservative establishment either. Unfortunately, the government in countless ways seeks to amass power for itself while producing fear and dependency in the populace. Really, it‚Äôs not a Democrat problem or Republican problem; they‚Äôre basically two sides of the same coin. Heads, they win; tails, you lose.
Surely you‚Äôre in favor of progress. One good question, though, is what exactly this constitutes . Also, who gets to define what is progress? All that might seem rhetorical, but these are important matters. Likely you see change as a good thing. But who‚Äôs setting the agenda, deciding which direction that change goes? Actually, we have answers for all that.
In fact, we might have some more in common with you than you expect. Don‚Äôt care for agribusiness? Neither do we . Are you troubled by the influence of the ultra-wealthy in the political process? We are too . Do you suspect that the powerful have set up a system of managed democracy, where they‚Äôre pulling the purse strings of both the Republicans and the Democrats? (If you supported Bernie Sanders, you‚Äôve probably figured that one out already!) We understand you.
Today‚Äôs political and social scene 
You might be disenchanted by some of the things going on with the Democratic Party today. Perhaps you‚Äôve heard of their hypocrisy and contempt for the public . Are you troubled by some of the Clinton scandals, maybe even wondered if there was more to it than you expected ?
Perhaps your questioning goes deeper; you might wonder who hijacked liberalism . It once stood for helping the working man, but some time in the 1960s it turned into so much squabbling divisiveness. Actually, there‚Äôs a reason for that ; the culture war began long before the 1990s! That wasn‚Äôt about liberation, but rather a deliberate attempt to spread divisiveness and weaken the fabric of society.
Also, taxpayers have spent untold money on social programs, but why don‚Äôt they solve problems? Instead, they create intergenerational poverty. You might be shocked to learn that encouraging dependency, along with taxing and spending to oblivion, was actually a stratagem meant to crash the system . That‚Äôs not about helping the disadvantaged; it‚Äôs about using them! Schemes like these‚Äîcausing societal upheaval so a Socialist paradise will magically fall into place‚Äîare pretty reckless.
You might shake your head in bewilderment at online mobs of misguided youths spewing bile about things that don‚Äôt really matter. Sure, you‚Äôre against police brutality (as am I), but deep down you also fear what will come of all this open contempt for the law and violence against police . The authorities take a pretty dim view of cop killers; kind of sounds like someone behind the scenes wants to start a lot of trouble, doesn‚Äôt it?
Finally, you might wonder if the people on top of the liberal establishment really give a damn about the common people. We think it‚Äôs rotten that they‚Äôre using so many well-meaning people for the cynical ends of amassing money and power.
Likely you have some nagging concerns about what‚Äôs going on in society today. Why are women both liberated and spoiled , and sometimes even hostile? Can‚Äôt the feminists see that things aren‚Äôt really so bad ? Sure, you‚Äôre all about tolerance and have lots of gay friends, but you privately wonder if there should be sensible limits . You might be uncomfortable with all the evangelizing of ‚Äúalternative lifestyles‚Äù, especially if you have children in school.
You consider the press to be the bedrock of a free society, but you have doubts about journalistic integrity . Hey, we understand. The propaganda is everywhere, even in shows for young children . The media has been feeding you bullshit all your life, and we think their lying is rotten. You deserve better than that.
Starting to reconsider? 
A die-hard Social Justice Warrior will seethe with rage for me bringing up these uncomfortable facts. Even if you‚Äôre a moderate, you might be reluctant to consider any of this. We understand; rethinking deeply held beliefs is a painful process. For so many things, you‚Äôll see that what you‚Äôve been told is right is actually wrong, and what is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù is really right.
Many on the left have been there before and found their way out. For me, someone explained that I‚Äôm not responsible for the world‚Äôs problems. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù The endless attempts in college to ram opinions down my throat hardened my resolve. Others who‚Äôve made the journey have different stories. Some got religion. Others realized that their past fanaticism has hurt others . Some wondered why decades of costly social programs haven‚Äôt accomplished anything. Some came to see that preferential treatment in hiring decisions is anything but ‚Äúfairness‚Äù.
It‚Äôs in your best interests to purge the misconceptions and guilt trips from your mind. Still, you don‚Äôt have to abandon everything and embrace the polar opposite. Some have reached a synthesis position .
Welcome to the other side 
If you‚Äôve read this far with an open mind‚Äîand checked out some of the referenced articles‚Äîthen you might be confused. Perhaps you‚Äôre tempted to reject our message. On the other hand, you might be shocked and even angry about what‚Äôs been going on in politics and society.
We understand; enlightenment is a painful process. We‚Äôre here for you. The truth hurts, but we‚Äôll do the best we can to tell it like it is, which is much more than can be said for what you‚Äôll see on television. I‚Äôve merely scratched the surface here; stick with us and you‚Äôll see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Next Tuesday is the American election, and, for better or for worse, we‚Äôll pick the next President at that time (assuming we don‚Äôt get mired in voter fraud and recounts), and we‚Äôll either brace for government mandated SJW enemas or bask in a temporary setback of those evil people. But, today, I want to talk on Trump once to match an article from last week, and I intend to focus on how he is the American candidate, as opposed to the special interest groups‚Äô one. 
I had a conversation last week with some people who acted as SJWs, but were later presented by a mutual friend as libertarian. The discussion immediately went nasty, with my opposition painting Trump (and anyone who supported him) as a racist and a bigot. Upon trying to determine why two of the left‚Äôs ubiquitous labels were applied to me this time, I learned that their perspective was, unless you were universally for all special interest groups, you were a bigot or a racist. False Dichotomy And The American Nightmare 
The problem, I found out, was that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into a black or white situation. Either you want all refugees here from the Middle East, all the Hispanics from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here, and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their lives around, or you‚Äôre a racist. There‚Äôs simply no middle ground. 
They don‚Äôt understand that Trump is not a special interest candidate, by which I mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of us at our expense, but he is not racist towards minorities, or sexist towards women. 
It is possible to be against illegal immigration, but treat Americans of Hispanic ancestry as valued citizens whom you will represent. It is possible to be against feminism, Affirmative Action, and the persecution of men for the profit of women, yet still value American women as Americans themselves. It is possible to note that some black people cause a disproportionate amount of crime, yet note that some police are racist, and see that there are bad and good cops AND bad and good black people. 
The American Dream is that all men are created equal, and that‚Äôs men as in humanity, not just males. It is not that all men are equal, and there‚Äôs a big difference to note here. You have the same opportunities as everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability, and I do not know anyone, myself included, that is against governmental aid for the disabled. 
What we have, instead, is the American Nightmare, where the left uses government and taxes for the most inane of causes, trying to fix any disadvantaged group‚Äôs lot, real or imagined, so that things will be better. They take from the producers, and give to the non-producers so that, according to their idealistic vision, they will suddenly become productive members of society (or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote Democrat for the rest of their lives.) The Good Of The Country Over That Of The Individual 
Long gone are responsible Democrats like Kennedy who told us to ask what you can do for your country. Every recent Democratic President, from Carter to Obama, and most of the Democrat Congressmen, view the working middle class of the country as simply a group to exploit for their pet special interest groups. Trump is the first candidate in a long time who isn‚Äôt for the blacks, or the gays, or the Muslims, or the feminists, or whatever, and that matters a lot. 
The reason why not being for a special interest group (which is ALL that Hillary is for, with her youth vote, black vote, women‚Äôs vote, gay vote, etc.) is so important is that these groups, even put together, do not matter when it comes down to the good of the country. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs plenty of good, hardworking black people, just like there‚Äôs the same for women, and for gays, and for young people, but these hardworking folks from all these groups aren‚Äôt going to be part of the BLM, or La Raza, or Lamda, because they‚Äôre too busy being productive Americans. Activism is for unemployed people. 
What‚Äôs going to happen if we don‚Äôt placate BLM and just ignore them? They riot a bit more and some get arrested? What if we told them that people that commit crimes to protest being treated like they commit a lot of crimes is ass-backwards thinking and counter-productive to their goals? They‚Äôd quit rioting. 
What would happen if we shut the Mexican border down to illegal immigration, but made a straightforward, but strict, path to citizenship for Hispanics that wanted to be citizens? What if we said, this is America, we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your children, but the national language IS English, and all business and schooling will be done in it, and in it only, and it‚Äôs your choice to not learn it, but the difficulties that will arise from that choice are all on you? They‚Äôd be Americans, proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship as well. 
What would happen if we told gay people that it‚Äôs cool if they have civil unions under the law, and have the same rights as everyone else, but it‚Äôs not cool trying to pick a fight with a Christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their God and that you‚Äôre sinning makes you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right? 
What if we told them it‚Äôs ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult, but you don‚Äôt have to try to make five-year-olds decide if they‚Äôre gay or straight when they shouldn‚Äôt be wondering about that till puberty hits? They‚Äôd be normal Americans who just happen to like sex with the same gender, and they‚Äôd quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our faces. 
What would happen if we talked to Muslims and said that there is a huge, deafening, silence when it comes to the subject of Islamic Terrorism from them that makes it hard to trust any of them? What if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of its tacit acceptance and support of terrorism, and part of that help means supporting us vetting Muslims coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorists than people of other religions and ethnicities? They‚Äôd go along with that and maybe realize we‚Äôre fixing a problem, not hating a people. 
What would happen if we told women that feminism has all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for false-rape accusers both makes men not trust women and insults any real rape survivor? What would happen if we told them that giving them jobs for their genitalia over their skills is destroying industries by lowering the only standard that matters, that of merit; that of excellence? 
What if we told them that gender ratios and quotas may fix the macro view of sexism, but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed as all hell towards women and, when you do that to the majority of men, you‚Äôll be just as successful, and just as hated by men as men were and were hated by you in years past? They‚Äôd realize that it‚Äôs not a competition, it‚Äôs a cooperation, and maybe skill should be valued over sex. 
What would happen if we stopped all these divisive issues that really don‚Äôt do anything other than tear us apart and work on a better economy, on rights for all, on border security? What would happen if we simply looked at each other as Americans, and put us, all of us, first? What would happen if we ripped out the crap in the Federal government that overtaxes people, or deploys armed forces against our own countrymen? What would happen if we made the Supreme Court Constitutional again, and made term limits a reality for Congress? Maybe we could get a government for, by, and of the people again. Maybe America can indeed by great again like the man says. Conclusion 
I‚Äôm not in a special interest group. No President, outside of George W. Bush right after the September 11th attacks, that I can recall since my childhood, has been for me as an American. I‚Äôve always been someone to be taxed, to be disarmed, to be hated, to be blamed. It‚Äôs not racism or bigotry to want us all to be treated as equals and not be penalized for real and imagined wrongs that occurred in the past before I was born, or more recently yet with which I had nothing to do. 
I‚Äôm not part of the problem. I‚Äôm an American; the people who say I am part of the problem are the problem. Their candidate, mired in scandal, corruption, and treason, is Hillary Clinton. Mine, with a message of hope for the country, not just some groups in it, is Donald Trump.";english;2016-11-02T14:09:51.386+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;Donald Trump Is The Candidate For Americans, Not Special Interests;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Reams of content have been written on the topic, both on ROK and elsewhere: indeed, it‚Äôs possible to get lost in a tsunami of pick-up advice.
But while it can be useful to absorb successful people‚Äôs techniques, a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself. To that end, here is a list of the top five habits I‚Äôve observed in men who are great with women.
1. They take every opportunity 
Guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them. In this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs. They know that the market is in a constant state of flux, and that change is at the heart of opportunity. As such, like the speculators of pussy they are, they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid, regardless of the circumstances.
Game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time. I would wholeheartedly endorse this. I would also add that however many opportunities you‚Äôre taking now, there are always more to be had. I, for example, will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while I‚Äôm traveling to my office on the subway. There are so many cute girls on their way to work in London (or any reasonably-sized commuter city) and yet guys won‚Äôt talk to them, rationalizing that it is too early, she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm crazy or whatever. In actual fact, I‚Äôve probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time.
So next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl, be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances. It is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game.
2. They notice and follow up on IOIs 
While most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl, the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you so-called ‚Äòindicators of interest‚Äô, or IOIs, without you having done anything.
While I would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay, I would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them, and to follow up with alacrity. Not only do direct IOIs frequently lead to sex, but also, if you fail to pursue a potentially-interested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards. Men, after all, are the more romantic gender. There are few more lasting self-inflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated, had you had the courage to speak to her.
The successful seducer is always on the lookout for IOIs, therefore, and he‚Äôll execute quickly when he gets them, even if it means deviating slightly from his routine. For example, a while back I was on a subway train when I got strong direct eye contact from an attractive, petite and very feminine brunette‚Äîjust my type. Once you‚Äôve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid IOI from casual interest, but the best way to describe it is as that ‚Äúrabbit in the headlights‚Äù look that girls give when they are truly smitten.
Well, she was giving me that look and I knew I had to follow up. When she got of the train I went right after her, introduced myself on the platform, took her number and then left. A drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later. Had I not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected.
Remember: always be willing to go after a sure thing, and never leave money on the table.
3. They stand out from the crowd 
Every truly successful seducer I have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd. This can manifest itself in many ways, but primarily I‚Äôm talking about standing out physically (in terms of what you wear) and standing out in terms of your personality.
While the old concept of ‚Äúpeacocking‚Äù is rightly maligned by both men and women these days, there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that, all else being equal, the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacks-and-sweatshirt counterpart. A former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else I‚Äôve ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession.
I appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity (‚Äúwhat real man takes so much care over his clothes?‚Äù) but remember that narcissism is one of the three ‚Äúdark triad‚Äù characteristics that are like catnip to women (along with Machiavellianism and psychopathy). Therefore, taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lot‚Äîif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in.
Your personality, too, should be larger than life. Don‚Äôt be obnoxious, but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group.
4. They are dominant 
There can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men, and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant. Now of course, the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no. Nevertheless, within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language, your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance ‚Äì both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity.
The key thing here is to appear decisive and unwavering‚Äîeven if secretly you aren‚Äôt. For example, after you‚Äôve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date, try getting up, taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi. When she questions what you‚Äôre doing just say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going back to my place to watch a movie.‚Äù Doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her.
Now, in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and that‚Äôs fine ‚Äì just do the actions anyway and see what happens. She‚Äôs much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesn‚Äôt, she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet.
5. They don‚Äôt apologize 
Highly successful seducers never apologize‚Äîor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway. The fact of the matter is you can‚Äôt make an omelette without breaking eggs. If you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cocky-funny humor then the chances are you‚Äôre going to offend someone every so often.
Now, I‚Äôm not recommending that you should be a dick‚Äîbe classy and convivial in all your interactions. But the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal Valhalla. If someone gets offended then make a joke but don‚Äôt apologize. As long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for.
Remember, an apology is a submission to someone else‚Äôs frame‚Äîand that is never a good look.

For tens of thousands of years, when boys hit the age of puberty, they were forced to undergo a set of challenges.
These challenges were meant to break them down, and build them back up even stronger. These challenges were meant to test them as men, and they are collectively known as an ‚Äúinitiation,‚Äù or as a ‚Äúrite of passage.‚Äù When a boy successfully completed the tasks laid before him, he became a man.
Our society, for the most part, lacks these rites of passage. This is, in large part, why there is such a lack of masculinity in our culture ‚Äîboys are never given a chance to develop into men. We have all of these 45 year old boyish-men running around for a reason: there exists no institutionalized rite of passage in the West.
Despite this, however, I believe that learning game is a form of initiation. It contains all of the traits necessary to turn a boy into a man. It teaches boys to develop self-confidence , despite what women think of them, to become decisive and assertive, and to remain persistent and cultivate strength of will.
Death Of The Ego 
One of the primary functions of a rite of passage, is that it destroys a boy‚Äôs ego. This is necessary, for in order for him to become a man, his identification with boyhood must be destroyed. In other words, he must cease to view himself as a boy, and come to view himself as a man.
This is, in a nutshell, what most of the rites of passage were designed to do‚Äîthis is why many of them simulated death, in a rather belly-of-the-whale-esque fashion. One rite of passage, of the Aborigines to be specific, entailed kidnapping a young boy from his mother.
When a boy would reach the age of puberty, the men of the village would sneak into his home during the night and kidnap him; his mother would put on a big show, screaming and fighting, to make it seem realistic. The men would blindfold the boy and take him to the middle of the woods.
He would then spend the next several months undergoing challenges; he would not see a single woman for this period of time. This sudden yanking from the ‚Äúmother-world,‚Äù of safety, and being thrust into the ‚Äúfather-world‚Äù of dangerous challenges, symbolized his death as a boy.
When the boy returned home, he would view himself as a man. He would carry himself taller, he would interact with the women differently, and he would have a new sense of purpose. In many ways, as I will soon explain, game does all of these things for the men willing to learn it.
Facing Fears 
Many of these challenges that boys were forced to face involved overcoming their fears. Fear of death, fear of the unknown, and fear of failure were all overcome during these rites of passage. As an example, one Native American rite of passage involved making a boy sit, blindfolded, on a tree trunk for three days straight.
Imagine his fear as he heard the various animals during the night; the howling, the cawing, and the roaring of the animals alone would be enough to terrify even the bravest of men. Then, add in the elements of cold and wind, the bugs that must have crawled over his feet, and the fear of a rival tribe member killing him, and it becomes very apparent how brave the men of the past must have been.
Then, once three days had passed, a man of the village would come and remove the boy‚Äôs blindfold. This, again, is symbolic of his rebirth; for three days straight, he was blind and helpless. Then, his vision returned and he emerged a new man.
All throughout the rites of passage of history, whether they be of the Inuits, the Amazon tribes, or the South African tribes, there are some very common characteristics: facing your fear, being reborn, and coping with uncertainty are all critical parts of these initiations.
Why Were These Rituals Necessary? 
Upon contemplation, it becomes very clear why these rituals were necessary. The world that we live in is radically different than the world that our ancestors lived in. A tribe of weak men meant extinction; there was no ‚Äúmilitary,‚Äù or ‚Äúsafety.‚Äù If the men could not protect the tribe, it would not be protected.
Imagine, right now, if a marauding band of 25 vandals roamed into your neighborhood. They were all extremely jacked, mean looking, and each one was carrying some sort of weapon; a baseball bat, a stick, or a crowbar. Do you think that you and your neighbors would have the balls to fight them off?
You, being a reader of ROK, may very well fight a noble fight‚Äîbut your neighbors? I seriously doubt that a purple-haired, complaining, self-castrating feminist ‚Äúman‚Äù would be of any use during a battle such as this.
Now, try to imagine that this sort of thing happened fairly regularly for our ancestors. It was not uncommon for neighboring tribes to frequently attack you, so it was an absolute necessity that the men be trained for battle. But, being trained for battle requires more than physical strength.
It requires ferocity, it requires strength of will, decisiveness, assertiveness, and a complete lack of fear. These are the characteristics that rites of passage were meant to breed, for without them, a tribe would go extinct.
Are These Rituals Still Necessary? 
Someone might point out that we aren‚Äôt at war anymore, so these rituals aren‚Äôt necessary. Although I agree that we aren‚Äôt in a state of constant warfare anymore, I still believe that these rites of passage are extremely necessary. Here‚Äôs why.
Men and women both have distinct psychological makeups; there is no denying this, no matter how hard the Marxists cry and clamor. Men and women are different. Boys have an inherent desire to be a part of something greater than themselves, namely a tribe. Boys have an inherent desire to be welcomed into the world of men‚Ä¶and we aren‚Äôt getting it, because there isn‚Äôt even a world of men anymore.
The once sacred separation of the genders has been desecrated. Only a select handful of men‚Äôs organizations still exist: the manosphere, the Freemasons, and various other spiritual organizations. It used to be commonplace for gentleman‚Äôs organizations to exist everywhere, but they‚Äôve become a thing of the past.
This is why, in large part, we‚Äôre experiencing such a crisis of masculinity; men don‚Äôt know who they are anymore. We don‚Äôt have any healthy male role models. All we‚Äôve got is weak men who justify their weakness with feel good aphorisms. We want more, but we don‚Äôt get more.
Any man who is attuned to this can feel it; he can feel the general sense of boyishness that the adulthood of men seems to hold onto. There‚Äôs no chance for us to prove ourselves. There‚Äôs no dragons to slay, no enemies to fight off, and no fears to overcome.
And we‚Äôre suffering. We can feel it in our bones. Not only are men unnecessary, but we don‚Äôt even have opportunities to grow and develop like the men of the past. We don‚Äôt have any initiations or male guidance; no men to reassure our belonging in the tribe, no obstacles to face.
Learning Game: The New Initiation? 
I believe that, although it isn‚Äôt perfect, game is a phenomenal substitute for this lack of a male initiation ritual. Game provides us with many of the characteristics that you need to be a man, and it has many of the characteristics that the old rituals of the past did:
Destroys your ego Requires you to face your fears Forces you to be decisive, in times of uncertainty Develops confidence, ferocity, and a strong will Again, obviously game isn‚Äôt perfect. One could certainly make the argument that one‚Äôs masculinity shouldn‚Äôt be contingent upon what women think, and I agree 100%. But do you know what? You may get into game for women‚Äôs approval, but any seasoned player knows that you actually STAY in the game for your own personal growth.
When men first start learning game, they get into it because their sex life isn‚Äôt what they want it to be. They think that learning game will get them girls, and it does. But something happens along the way‚Äîthey start getting all of the sex that they could ever want, and they realize that game has changed them on a deeper level.
Game provides you with an outlet to overcome your anxiety, and to live life fearlessly ; by consistently going out and facing your fears of rejection, you develop a certain fearless mindset that bleeds into other areas of your life.
Learning game creates a whole-personality transformation, that cannot be found anywhere else. No other hobby, outlet, or activity will change you as much as game does, aside from an actual initiation conducted by the men of the past.
Game Makes You A Man 
Game will transform you from a boy into a man, for a vast number of reasons. First off, game demolishes your ego . A lot of men have this delusion that they could get any hot girl that they want, but they are forced to face reality when they actually go out and try to pull girls.
This is why so many men hate game, and can‚Äôt handle it: you‚Äôre forced to face reality very quickly, and most men can‚Äôt take this. When you start to go out and learn game, you have one of two choices:
Accept that you suck with girls, and keep trying to improve Viscerally deny reality and perpetuate your delusions by never going out and experiencing rejection Most men choose the latter. Their ego is far too precious, and they can‚Äôt handle it being challenged. Those men who do have the courage to demolish their ego, however, will end up bedding women more gorgeous than they ever imagined (take my word for it).
Second, learning game requires you to face your fears. Think of how many men have approach anxiety nowadays; do you think that this underlying anxiety might bleed into other areas of their life? Of course! So once you overcome your approach anxiety in pickup, this fearlessness will bleed into other areas of your life. In other words, you‚Äôre starting to develop a totally new personality that isn‚Äôt afraid of living life and taking risks.
Game forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty. A lot of the time, in fact most of the time, you don‚Äôt know whether or not a girl‚Äôs friends will be okay with you. You don‚Äôt know if she has a boyfriend, you don‚Äôt know if she lives nearby, you don‚Äôt know this, you don‚Äôt know that. When it comes to game, there‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty.
This is why learning game teaches you to accept uncertainty and make take decisive action in the face of it. What other skill could be more masculine? The men of the past revered this skill, because it‚Äôs what their entire livelihood was based around.
You see a pack of deer 100 feet away; you don‚Äôt know if you can kill them or not. Should you take the risk? An enemy tribe is attacking; should you run to your hut and get a better weapon, or pick up a rock and do what you can? You‚Äôre injured and alone, but you see a nearby village; should you ask them for help? Would they kill you or heal you?
Learning to take decisive action in the face of uncertainty was a skill that every man had for millenia; his life depended on it. Now, the only way to cultivate this skill is through game or other, more extreme measures, such as fighting in a war or something (although even then, you won‚Äôt have much freedom to make decisions).
All in all, game will take you from a boy to a man. It will teach you to be confident, and to become completely detached from either rejection or acceptance from women. It will help you to develop assertiveness and social calibration.
Most importantly, however, it will teach you to overcome your fears. In the words of my favorite pickup mentor: ‚ÄúLearning game is an Odyssey of the mind.‚Äù It teaches you to overcome your fears, to face your lingering negative beliefs, and to grow as a man. Our society gives us no right of passage, so we‚Äôve created our own. Go out and learn game, for it will change your life.

7967;aa07e6f6cbdde403a855ab1a23466714eca3390d;0;Jean-Batave Poqueliche;2016-11-03T14:05:59.491+02:00;6 Reasons To Create Fat Control Laws And Obesity-Free Zones;"Lately, gun-free zones and gun control laws are all the rage among the globalists and liberals of all shapes (usually circular) and sizes .
Those measures, solely aimed at disarming the people and depriving them of the sacred right to defend themselves, has shown its vast ineffiency, with gun victims and terrorist attacks on the rise in those zones since no honest citizen can shoot back to stop the massacre.
Here is why I propose, once a conservative government reaches the White House, to create Fat Control Laws (‚ÄúF.C.L‚Äù) and Obesity-Free Zones (‚ÄúO.F.Z‚Äù) as obesity is indeed a more serious threat to the lives of Americans than honest citizens carrying legally purchased guns. Here are six potential benefits:
1. Simple philanthropy 
Obese people are delusional thinking that it is great to be a useless sack of shit. Nowadays, they get fed a distorted reality saying that ‚Äúbig and round is beautiful‚Äù when the natural reaction, deeply branded in our DNA, is disgust, mockery and suspicion.
Fat and sedentary lifestyles kill much more than guns . The war against obesity is as important as the war on crime or drugs. Bovine people not only harm themselves but others too. By creating measures to prevent them from becoming fat or exhorting them lose weight, we are helping our common man to preserve his dignity as a human being.
In their case, sugar and salt create a dopamine rush and an addiction loop very similar to an addiction to opiates. We must show our potbellied (or barrelbellied) junkies the way as they can‚Äôt take the steps themselves.
Just like with restrictions on cigarettes, if they are stupid enough to gorge themselves on calories, we must conclude that there is a severe lack of judgement on their part and prevent them from purchasing the source of their misery.
2. Preserving aesthetics and other senses 
No more eyesore of seeing fatties rolling around everywhere you go. Imagine a beach with a plethora of more feminine, attractive and thin women by banning whales in bikinis.
Our nostrils would also be free of the olfactory offence that they throw in our faces. Say goodbye to the pungent smell of fat rolls sweat at your local grocery store.
No more 280-lb SJW land whales with laboured breath sounds in waiting rooms or uncontrolled farting in the public transport like you are in a cattle train. It could be tomorrow.
3. Positive impact on children 
I do not want these people to roam free and that my future progeny can witness it and think that this is normal. Worse, if the PC politburo tells them it is beautiful to be a beached whale. Let‚Äôs send them far until they get better. Out of sight, out of mind as they say.
Legal elements should be implemented against pernicious publicity aired on television and directly aimed at children, whether by the time chosen to air it or the promotion it makes of unhealthy eating.
Of course, with Fat Control Policies, kids will get bullied at school. Some will cut themselves for being called fattie. So what? Adapt and overcome or crawl in a ball and cry. The weakest has to be left behind if he does not want to save himself.
4. A healthier population You are under arrest for being an immovable, gargantuan arsehole
Fat is not a silent killer. Hundreds of thousands of people die (with a loud thud) every year of obesity-related diseases, a largely preventable cause of death worldwide. Today, 1 in 5 Americans and 1 in 11 Britons dies from being a fat arse with no self-control.
It is a fact that obesity causes death by cardiac arrest, diabetes, coronary and liver diseases, cancer, and hypertension among others. Promoting a healthy lifestyle and physical activity will create a longer life expectancy.
Physically healthier people are mentally healthier too (boost of self-esteem and confidence). Fat Control Laws will reduce mental health issues such as depression, inferiority complex or suicidal tendencies caused by obesity. That is also less money spent by the taxpayer
5. A boost for the economy 
According to a 2009 report, ham planets cost the economy $117 billion a year . And that is for the American economy alone! The number of human cattle is still growing exponentially. It inflicted more than a $325.8 billion loss to the economy in 2010.
In 2016, we can reasonably assume that the number of obese people has grown and has impacted the wallet of your average American even harder.
A fitter population, with its nutritional choices, would result in a more natural, higher-quality food industry. Smaller amounts of food produced and needed, resulting in reduced resources and materials wasted during and after its production.
We could see the end of excessive fossil fuel used to transport land walruses and their fat arse across long distances and hogging the space that could be use by three normal individuals.
Healthier, more active people are happier, more productive and successful since the cogs of the machinery are not coated in fat. An age of stronger, self-governed, high-energy men bringing a healthier society. It‚Äôs YUGE!
6. A new sexual and romantic market 
It will bring a more balanced sexual arena to limit the accumulation of fat. A radical answer to the phenomenon of plummeting testosterone levels caused by high fat percentage, trimming the numbers of plump omegas and sexual market voluntary rejects.
Let‚Äôs impose a healthier diet for higher numbers of attractive, thin and pretty women. Greater numbers of quality girls to choose from reduces aggressive competition, which decreases the bitch shields of thin, entitled girls.
Endless supplies of betas queuing to capture crumbs of their attention would be a thing of the past. As I said it before, ‚Äúmale thirst is the root of all evil‚Äù when it comes to romantic competition.
Sexier citizens means more relationships, a peak in libido and reproduction of physically and mentally balanced individual, helping nations suffering from low birth rate.
One more element for the protection of Western society (being the most affected one) and its people, cementing the bases of a strong future, fighting globalism and the myth they try to sell us about global overpopulation.
By logical natural process, bronies, corpulent man-children and manga conventions should also disappear soon.
The Fat Control Laws 1. Segregated Obesity-Free Zones 
Our diabetic mammoths must be isolated from further propaganda and tasty treats.
This is why we should create large (VERY large) fenced areas to protect the healthy subjects, as fat is more dangerous than guns.
Let‚Äôs pen the big-boned rejects in separated zones where access to junk food and other harmful products would be forbidden. Fresh water, open spaces, salad and treadmills as far as the eye could see.
BUILD THAT FENCE!
We shall call it the ‚ÄúDavid Fatrelle Center for Porcine Rehabilitation‚Äù
2. Permits 
A permit would have to be issued (similar to a gun-carrying permit) for the purchase of junk food, high-carb snacks, soda drinks etc. After a doctor‚Äôs physical exam of the patient, slim citizens would be delivered a permit with a stamp of approval, granting them access to supermarkets or venues where processed or junk food is served.
3. Mandatory workouts 
Compulsory exercise would be imposed to obese people to reach a standard BMI. We could bring it up a notch where a fine could be issued after a determined period of time if the weight loss target has not been reached.
A Steps Counter Activity tracker would have to be worn or installed on their smartphone and a quota of physical activity would have to be reached on a day to day basis.
Just like the programs for convicted criminals or drug abusers with reports to the local police station on a regular basis, the stubbornly chunky would be followed during a rehabilitation stage and their progress monitored.
4. Fat shaming 
Fat shaming works great, as we have seen before . Remember the shitstorm of the ‚Äúbeach body‚Äù campaign , immediately declared thought criminals by the Body Positive Lobby or Islamic Thought Tribunal of Londonistan?
Or the cold-blooded leaflets given by anonymous though criminals to particularly adipose London Tube passengers? YUGE success.
Pourquoi √ßa n‚Äôexiste pas? 
Fat people are a dead weight to society in all senses of the term and to compensate this burden, they must chip in one way or another and repair the harm they cause.
Fitter people means a self-aware, powerful mass that strives for greatness.
But the liberals in charge don‚Äôt want that. This is why they produce massive amounts of harmful, processed food and encourage the pleb, by manipulating publicity and promoting make-believe, to remain fat, weak and above all, docile.
It‚Äôs all part of a plan. Fat Control Laws are the answer to that great evil.

Andr√© is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 3, 2016 Mind 
Passions and emotions are an almost bottomless pit. Start digging there and you will find new ones, or new relations between this and that tidbit of emotional content. So-called Enlightenment philosophers who tried to theorize the passions‚Äîsomething that had been done at greater length, actually, by Thomas Aquinas‚Äîcould never agree on how many there were or even how much they exactly mattered in the course of life. 
Whether or not you have been reading my last two pieces on the topic, remember this is about mastering passions in the most general sense. This is not only about emotional restraint or seduction. Our own emotional states are the first in line, but mastering the passions is also about spotting what other people are feeling, how they can be led to a specific course of action, and what tends to make them tick. Mastering the passions is far from evident, it rather takes times and experience: the concepts and directions I am providing here aim at giving some conscious clarity about things that are by nature a bit muddy. 
Artists, though they often suffer from mental problems, are skilled at painting a particular vision in vivid colours, allowing their public to share a specific point of view and emotional state. This is something the elite know very well. Critics trashed Ayn Rand‚Äôs Atlas Shrugged because they could see themselves painted there as passive-aggressive cultural parasites. Rand‚Äôs novel was more cogent, and attracted more heat, than her barely original ‚Äúphilosophical‚Äù pieces today sold at the cheapest price on the second-hand book market. 
More recently, the movie The Fall (2004) got backlashed by some of the mainstream media on the grounds that it depicted Hitler as ‚Äútoo human.‚Äù While seeing actor Bruno Ganz pondering, eating, talking to his closest company or getting angry, the viewer could perhaps feel a bit of empathy to him. Which is, of course, unacceptable to a Left that clings to the idea of a crazy, careless, ‚Äúinhuman‚Äù dictator to be forever cast as an embodiment of evil. Hollywood directors do not like witnessing others competing with their own emotional mastery. 
We need artists, as well as qualified cultural critics, to take some distance from the mainstream propaganda disguised as entertainment and expand an alternative culture and artworks. Emotions explored in the present series can be used just that way. 1. Gratitude 
Gratitude denotes a trained and refined disposition. Being graceful means ‚Äúrecognizing that the good in our life can come from something that is outside us and outside our control‚Äù (Neel Burton, Heaven and Hell , chap.8, p.61). It focuses on positive things we already have and that cannot be ascribed to our sole merit or efforts. 
The traditional world, whatever the particular cultural or religious form it was embodied into, always emphasized the necessity of being grateful. You owed your existence to God, to your family and your community. None of these goods were actually deserved, which meant you had to be grateful for them and repay them by being a dutiful member of the community as well as a dutiful father for your own children. A lot of prayers and ancient rites imply a thanksgiving for what one already has. 
Moving later in time, it is striking to see that modern progressivism breeds the exact opposite mindset. The ideology of rights make many goods granted, not a ‚Äúthank you for‚Äù but an ‚ÄúI have a right to.‚Äù Neophilia (the relentless pursuit of novelty) always casts a bad shadow on what has been around for some time, as if what was coming later was always better. 
Advertisement, gossip culture, economic growth pressure, quest for victimhood lead to envy and always being more or less frustrated with what one already has, regardless of what it is. By leading us to always want more, progressivism makes us oblivious to what we already have or how it does not stem from pure individual merit‚Äîand, when it flatters the ego, it makes us complacent and far from cultivating the art of being thankful. 
Turning our backs from the modern, ungraceful mindset is easier said than done. To start with: loud-mouthed girls should be remembered they owe their nice, luxurious workplaces to the men who built them, LGBTBBQ should thank their heterosexual parents and ancestors for their very lives, anti-white black activists should remember they would not even exist had their ancestors not benefited from their white colonizers healthcare technology. Feel free to expand the list. Ultimately, I think, every person who is modern or westernized enough can be outed as ungraceful for something. 2. Trust 
A famous study showed that multiculturalism was closely correlated with defiance and a lack of trust in each other. Provided that we enlarge a bit our definition of multiculturalism, this absolutely makes sense. Some ethnic groups are especially prone to violence, and some ‚Äúminority‚Äù groups are rewarded for freely accusing the silent majority, but the hegemony of political correctness made it a taboo. Communities have been fragmented by individualism, i.e. each person looking to take as much as she can, and by an ‚Äúantiracist‚Äù white guilt that soon became an intra-white generalized suspicion of ‚Äúracism.‚Äù People do not identify anymore with the larger society and often cannot even identify with a smaller community‚Äîwhich makes everyone else a potential enemy. 
Yet, without trust, life becomes unbearable. If you can‚Äôt go to the streets without the possibility of getting mugged by, say, BLM activists , or go to a family meal without the prospect of a lukewarm struggle with aging leftist parents, or have a relationship with a girl without the possibility of her making a false rape accusation , there aren‚Äôt a lot of things you can do on the long run. Without trust in other people, you have to trust the complex of big corporations, NGO, and State institutions we call the system‚Äîand be dependent from it for things as basic as food and shelter. 
Only trust in each other can make life sustainable and long-term projects workable. To re-create trust, we have to make people accountable and bound to precise rules, reward good behaviours while punishing bad ones. Actions must bear consequences. But before neomasculinity gets into power, men should strive to establish a reputation through reliability, persistence, and a strong mindset. I could wager you have been more trusting of your Facebook friends last years than of the mainstream media , the former conveying more trustworthy information than the latter. 3. Desire 
Modern capitalism and progressivism always ran on desire. Want cheaper prices? More goods? Better goods? More TV channels to watch? More monies? More ego and thinking you are the hot shit? Well, just buy in X or do some work for Y, and here it is‚Ä¶ um, nah, you just have to do some more, and some more, and some more. In the end, you forgot why exactly you are doing what you‚Äôre doing, or why you started to watch TV. But it all started with you led to perform something, no matter how surreptitiously framed as spontaneous or normal it was. 
The system plays on desires in three ways. It sets things to be desired, things to be feared or never desired at all, and things to be consummated without end. Things to be desired include everything the advertisement wants you to desire, like a revolving credit, a new sofa, an SUV or whatever, as well as the next step of ‚Äú progress ‚Äù as it has been elaborated on the top of the pyramid. 
Things to be feared are where the system wants you to be resigned and fatalistic: did you ever feel sad to see all these girls losing themselves into a sea of fat, bitching, and SJW-propaganda spouting? Too bad, that‚Äôs globalization, resistance is futile, move on! At last, things to be consummated are mainly produced to keep you busy and programmed though you are not really practising anything beyond staring at a screen. 
Lately, an important shift has been happening between the first and third ways to play on desires. Decades before, the average consumer had to desire owning more junk or being part of the ‚Äúprogress‚Äù: the system needed him to work and monitor his peers. Today, the junk is already everywhere, PC culture is already hegemonic, and the average American worker is no longer needed. Active desire is not needed anymore. 
Thus, the system has shifted into making the average Joe more passive. Instead of actually desiring more, the consumer should be content with surrogates of everything‚Äîpseudo-group identity with team sports, pseudo-sports with football and basket on TV, pseudo-sex with porn, pseudo-life with video games, pseudo-family life with animals, pseudo-expertise when the average libtard obnoxiously parrots the media on everything. This is Brzezinski‚Äôs tittytainment in a nutshell. 
Even if you don‚Äôt give up on having a real life instead of a surrogate, the system will still want you to desire things only for yourself, thus retreating into individualism, instead of trying to actually weight on the world. Either you surrender to ‚Äúthe progress‚Äù or you try to ignore it before it comes for you. As if nothing could change. 
Don‚Äôt let the elite frame the world according to its own interests. Desire self-realization and weighting on the course of the world. Of course, our female counterparts should desire being loving, caretaking, and definitely on our side. To conclude this series 
Once again, it is hard to sketch in a few words what could be done with passions or emotions. What I have mostly dwelled into is how those already in power manipulate them and what we could do as to take them back. If you find the topic worthy of interest, you can expand it in two directions: first, documenting yourself on a particular passion or emotion, and second, using some by stirring it with a certain aim in mind. 
In the former case, I would recommend Neel Burton‚Äôs Heaven and Hell (quoted several times in the course of this series) as a point of departure. In the latter, being creative or simply assertive is up to you. Whether this looks more like efforts or self-persuasion or artistry does not matter much. 
Here, as well as in seduction, a tight framing is key. Whatever the topic, no vocabulary and no picture are really neutral, which is a problem as our perception and thinking orientation are often conditioned by these. The mastery of emotions is reinforced‚Äîand reinforces‚Äîthe mastery of representations. If this sounds far-fetched, let me provide some examples of use, examples you are absolutely free to expand as it suits you. 
In the comments space, several guys here have been giving a very negative portrayal of the nice guy: he would be a fake, a ‚Äúsneaky bastard,‚Äù a ‚Äújerk.‚Äù So guys who want to get laid or have their own interests, just as everyone else, are jerks? This looks like internalized feminist thinking. In my opinion, nice guys should elicit empathy, which goes through a positive portrayal emphasizing their willingness to respect the girl or how they were likely raised by an unmanly culture. 
A recent ROK piece about mainstream media has shown how these are making a conscious effort to hide and de-legimitate white victimhood: they paint vividly any crime where the victim is non-white and the perpetrator is, but mention no detail or do not mention at all any crime perpetrated by non-white(s) on white(s). 
The same pattern appears in the movie Elysium (2013), when the (of course) white villain mentions children she wants to protect from a mass of brown invaders, yet these children are never shown and consequently stir no empathy from the average watcher, whereas the brown-skinned are vividly depicted as humane and not responsible for their own poverty. 
Analyzing these phenomena is fine, but ultimately insufficient. Creative people on our side have to provide an alternative that includes mastered emotions. Picking up girls is part of, and gives some experience in, this wider game.";english;2016-11-03T20:55:28.790+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;3 More Emotions Men Should Master;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Everyone says that you shouldn‚Äôt judge a book by its cover, but that‚Äôs really difficult when the cover makes you throw up a little in your mouth. That‚Äôs how I felt when I was tasked with writing a review of Chad T. Cocker‚Äôs Memoirs of a Misogynist: An Erotic Novel for Men . What kind of ‚Äúman‚Äù would want to read an erotic novel? Romance and erotica are female masturbation material; trying to write a Harlequin novel men is like marketing lesbian porn to actual lesbians.
Or so I thought.
Despite the packaging, Memoirs of a Misogynist is one of the best works I‚Äôve read this year. Contrary to Cocker‚Äôs marketing, the novel is a examination of life as a man in modern America, filtered through the protagonist‚Äôs relationships with women. While it starts slowly, Cocker‚Äôs prose and honesty save the day and make Memoirs of a Misogynist absolutely worth your time and money.
From The Marquis De Sade To Neomasculinity 
Because mainstream publishing almost exclusively caters to women, underground and independent writers have turned to fill the void of male-centric literature. From braggadocios ‚Äúfratire‚Äù writers like Tucker Max and Maddox to ‚Äúloser lit‚Äù authors such as Andy Nowicki and Ann Sterzinger to our very own Roosh and Quintus Curtius, there‚Äôs a surfeit of alternative writing for men who are sick of the misandry and feminism of the ‚Äúreal‚Äù literary world.
Viewed against the backdrop of alternative publishing, Memoirs of a Misogynist is an odd animal indeed. When I first picked it up, I assumed it would be a tell-all memoir along the lines of Roosh‚Äôs A Dead Bat in Paraguay, or a roman √† clef in the fashion of Charles Bukowski‚Äôs work. However, it does indeed live up to its subtitle, as much of the novel is devoted to lengthy, detailed descriptions of the protagonist‚Äôs sexual encounters:
She‚Äôd also gotten used to her chastity belt, and that scared her. It still didn‚Äôt sit well with her that Master had total control over her sexual gratification. Slave was constantly wet and horny, and that made her even more compliant. The orgasms that Master gave her were unlike anything she had experienced before. They were mind-blowing. Even after a year together, their sex was electric and deeply satisfying.
In the introduction, Cocker warns us that the book is ‚Äúpossibly the dirtiest, most depraved, and most offensive novel you‚Äôve ever read,‚Äù making me wonder if he‚Äôs ever heard of 120 Days of Sodom. Still, the structure of Memoirs‚Äô plot and the skill of Cocker‚Äôs prose shows that he‚Äôs both acquainted with classic erotica and has actually had sex with a lot of girls. The first half of the book is reminiscent of Pauline Reage‚Äôs Story of O, in which a woman is systematically trained to become a sex slave.
Interestingly, Memoirs of a Misogynist also seems inspired by Venus in Furs: not the Velvet Underground song, but the erotic novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. It‚Äôs from Sacher-Masoch that we derive the term ‚Äúmasochism,‚Äù the tendency to derive sexual pleasure from pain (akin to how ‚Äúsadism‚Äù is derived from Sade), as the plot revolves around a man who desires nothing more than to be utterly subservient to his mistress. Severin‚Äôs humiliation at the hands of his lover drives him to become a ‚Äúmisogynist‚Äù in the same way that Cocker‚Äôs protagonist is one:
That woman, as nature has created her, and man at present is educating her, is man‚Äôs enemy. She can only be his slave or his despot, but never his companion. This she can become only when she has the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work.
(It‚Äôs worth noting that Sacher-Masoch was a feminist and believed that equal relationships with women would only become possible with women‚Äôs liberation. Insert your own joke here.)
Power Doesn‚Äôt Care What You Need, As Long As You‚Äôre On Your Knees 
Enjoying Memoirs of a Misogynist requires you to get past the initial few chapters, which read like Fifty Shades of Grey with about 30 extra IQ points. The initial plot concerns Melinda, a runaway who falls into the care of a wealthy man who goes unnamed for most of the book. After offering her room and board, the man and Melinda begin a relationship, sealed by a contract where she agrees to become his sexual plaything:
‚ÄúMy body is my Master‚Äôs. It is his blank canvas, for him to modify as many times, and in as many different ways as he chooses.‚Äù He could hear her breath quickening as he read. ‚ÄúHe will control my bodily functions; most particularly my orgasms. I will only orgasm when my Master allows me.‚Äù 
What saves the book‚Äîand what kept me reading‚Äîwas its depiction of the protagonist (henceforth referred to as ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù). Far from the masturbatory blank slate that Christian Grey was, Cocker depicts Master as a complex and conflicted character, constantly trying to rationalize the way he treats Melinda (later re-christened ‚ÄúSlave‚Äù). Cocker‚Äôs deft writing kept me wondering what the protagonist‚Äôs motivations were all the way to the end. The book also frequently switches to Melinda‚Äôs perspective; while it‚Äôs usually a challenge for male writers to depict female characters (and vice versa), Cocker is skilled enough to make her compelling as well.
Where Memoirs really picks up is in the second half, which is set nearly ten years later. The focus shifts to Elizabeth Avery, a disgraced doctor stripped of her medical license after she‚Äôs caught abusing a male patient. Destitute and despondent, she accepts a job as the personal physician of Master‚Äôs stable of whores, his lifestyle offending her feminist sensibilities:
Doctor Avery‚Äôs world was spinning. She tried to distance herself. This was just a patient, after all. She was being paid a significant amount of money for this job‚Äîthe kind of money that would solve a lot of her problems. Regardless, she couldn‚Äôt help but be disgusted that a woman had allowed herself to be treated this way. He‚Äôd said she consented to this. In fact, the way she looked at the man showed she clearly loved him, and was a willing participant in her modifications and degradation. The woman, or Melinda, as the man had called her, looked up at him with what the doctor could only call adoration.
Once again, it would have been easy for Cocker to depict Elizabeth as a raging, bra-burning feminist stereotype, but he agilely avoids clich√©s in favor of nuance. Elizabeth isn‚Äôt portrayed as a fire-breathing misandrist, but as a woman who unthinkingly absorbs leftist cant and has her life ruined because of it. The final chapters of the book show Elizabeth tussling with the sexual arousal she feels working for ‚ÄúMr. X‚Äù (her name for the protagonist) and her attempts to maintain her beliefs as the evidence of her failed life piles up. I won‚Äôt spoil the ending, other than to say that after finishing the book, I had to sit on it and digest it for a few days.
Each chapter of Memoirs begins with a factual statistic about the state of men and boys in America today, a jarring contrast with the depravity of the book‚Äôs action. I initially wondered why they were there, but as I approached the end of the book, it all suddenly clicked. Memoirs of a Misogynist is a biting look at what our toxic sexual marketplace does to men and women. American dating is like an acid bath: no one who dives into it comes out unscathed. Even men who are successful at getting laid are affected by what they have to do to get ahead. There are no winners, no saints, and no role models: just people trying to make the best of a broken system.
As I stated earlier, Memoirs takes a while to really get going, and if you‚Äôre not into lascivious descriptions of sex, the book won‚Äôt appeal to you. But if you want a haunting, piercing look at the horror show of modern gender relations, Memoirs of a Misogynist is a must-buy. I can‚Äôt wait to see what Cocker comes up with next.

1. Croatian girls are extremely receptive to day game. They want to be opened. Even if she has headphones and seems focused on her music, it can still go well. Same goes for girls on rollerblades (‚ÄúExcuse me, where can I buy rollerblades like yours?‚Äù). 
2. Croatia is one of those places where both indirect and direct game work. Pick one that suits the venue and your personality. What I did was open indirect, chat for a couple minutes, and then hit her with a compliment about her ‚Äúpositive energy‚Äù to see how she‚Äôd respond. If she smiled, I knew I was in. 
3. Girls will give you their number even if they have a boyfriend. It may not come out until the first meeting. To avoid this, when I was getting a number I‚Äôd jokingly say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not married, right?‚Äù If she had a boyfriend, she would then announce it with a guilty look on her face. 
4. Always go for the insta-date, especially if you‚Äôre doing street game. Not only will this weed out flakey girls, but it gives you an opportunity to find out what she wants in life. Croatia has a lot of ‚Äúgood‚Äù girls who don‚Äôt drink at all and want a serious relationship. You want to dump those prospects if you‚Äôre not staying long. 
5. A common issue you‚Äôll find on the first date is girls who want to bring their friends along. Don‚Äôt let them or you‚Äôll get stuck in a hellish group chat. It‚Äôs either a 1-on-1 date or nothing. Night Game 
6. You need to push the interaction as far as you can go. If you don‚Äôt at least get a kiss, the odds that number will lead to a date is 25% or less. If you get a passionate kiss with some hand-holding at the end, over 50%. It‚Äôs easy to get a number from a Croatian girl but you should resist: push for the kiss. It‚Äôs similar to what you should do in America. 
7. Absolutely do not add a Croatian girl to Facebook. They are accomplished attention whores and will string you along. If you didn‚Äôt at least get a phone number, you got nothing. 
8. Cockblocking is a huge problem. The best way to fight it is to be more selective about the venues you choose. Large clubs have the hottest girls, but they are harder to approach and you will end up getting cockblocked incessantly. Hipster bars have the ugliest girls, but you‚Äôll rarely get cockblocked. Experiment in the city to find something in the middle that has the best balance between beauty and attitude. So much of a successful Croatian experience will be based on the venue. Going from the best venue to the worst, you may even feel like you‚Äôre in a different country. As a general rule, if you‚Äôre in a club where the girls aren‚Äôt genuinely excited you‚Äôre a foreigner, you should go somewhere else. 
9. Since so many girls go out in pairs, it‚Äôs better to roll with a wingman than solo dolo. A problem you‚Äôll face if you ‚Äòre going out solo is that a girl doesn‚Äôt want to leave her friend alone. What I did was approach girls whose friend was already getting hit on by another guy. 
10. Don‚Äôt compliment at night . Croatian girls already have an elevated perception of themselves and get compliments all the time. They are not insecure as girls from the Baltics or Ukraine . 
11. Don‚Äôt call a girl before you bang her. They rarely answer. Text instead. 
12. Croatia is slowly embracing one-night stands. With the right logistics, you should be able to get them. They are far easier than a place like Ukraine. The key here is having tight logistics. It should be so tight that you can ‚Äútake a walk‚Äù with her and be at your place to hop in for a quick drink. The girls who are most likely to go for this will be 18-23 and who want a taste of the American sexual culture. Older women will be able to resist your logistical game. 
13. Similar to the above point, all your dates should be close to your apartment. If your date venue is more than half a mile away, you‚Äôre already shooting yourself in the foot. Even if a Croatian girl is playing aloof, she can turn on a dime once in a private room. 
14. The less snobby the club, the more acceptable it is to buy a girl a drink without getting ‚Äúpunished‚Äù for it. Croatia isn‚Äôt like other Eastern European countries where girls are generally upfront and honest with their intentions‚Äîthey will play you if you give them the opportunity, especially the higher end venues. Generally speaking, as long as she didn‚Äôt have a bitch face when you first approached her, you should be in the clear to buy a drink . 
15. The best game for Zagreb, the capital, is to have the best logistics possible. Sadly, Croatian girls flake more than average so you want the proximity of your apartment to act as bait for casual hangouts that turn into bangs. Unless you‚Äôre dealing with an older Croatian girl who is into you, you‚Äôll have to play the numbers game and not get hung up on any one girl. Get ready to meet some hardcore female players. 
16. If you put X hours a day into day game and X hours into night game, you‚Äôll be rewarded with night game first. You can get surprisingly fast bangs at night that day game doesn‚Äôt provide, mostly because aggressive night game easily screens out day girls who are simply bored but not really hankering for dick. If I go back to Croatia, I‚Äôll just move right next to a good bar.";english;2016-11-03T22:22:02.579+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;Comment on 16 Tips For Having Sex With Croatian Girls by WATCH: My Summer Vacation In Croatia;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Like many others, I once bought into the fallacy that you need a piece of paper from a university to succeed in life. At the age of thirty, I graduated from a university with an undergraduate degree, and the customary debt, which came along with it. Twenty-nine years later, I see how wrong I was.
Soon after graduating, I obtained an office job and moved to a city where I knew no one. The job I was so optimistic about turned out to be like marriage to a crack whore. Each day was as if walking through a minefield full of dysfunctional women, emasculated men, drama, backstabbing, cat-fights, and every other problem associated with modern workplaces. Worse yet, the cut male managers allowed trim to be in charge resulting in a fucked up toxic culture. After three tumultuous and abusive years, I found myself unceremoniously kicked to the curb, and surprisingly relieved.
After a lengthy stint of unemployment, I landed an entry-level job in a metal fabrication company. One of the benefits offered was tuition reimbursement for work related classes. I enrolled in welding classes at night, and upgraded my skills, all on my employer‚Äôs dime.
I immediately noticed a difference from my previous job. I worked exclusively with men. Except for a few token assholes, the men liked their solitude, did their jobs, and left each other alone. The work was varied, creative, and with overtime, the pay was decent. The fact that I had a work ethic, showed up every day on time, and desired to learn earned me respect quickly.
I eventually went down a different path, but returned to welding part-time as an adjunct instructor.
Welding is the joining of two metal pieces or parts by applying heat. A filler metal, or electrode, helps to make the joint. Power source supplies electricity required for heat, and a shielding gas or flux-covered electrode aids in the welding process.
The most common welding processes are Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), Flux Core Arc Welding (FCAW), Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), and Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW). Of these, Gas Metal Arc Welding is the easiest to learn and offers the fastest production. Welding involves both Ferrous (steel) and Non-ferrous metals (aluminum, stainless steel).
Why Welding? 1. According to a Bureau of Labor report, the need for welders will grow by 26 percent by 2020.
2. According to a National Association of Manufacturers report, nearly 81 percent of manufacturers in the United States report that they cannot find skilled welders to meet demand.
3. The American Welding Society reports that the average age for a welder is now in the mid-fifties
4. Entry-level wages in my region average $28,000-$40,000 annually, with skilled welders earning $50,000 and more after five years in the trade.
I frequently hear from employers who are desperate for skilled welders. One plant manager told me ‚Äúthere are too many computer jockeys and not enough people who can weld and turn a wrench.‚Äù Another manufacturer told me ‚Äúwe have over a dozen welders retiring and no one to replace them‚Äù. Further, the school I teach at has more jobs available than they have students enrolled.
What Welders Do Welders work in manufacturing, construction, maintenance repair facilities, and service companies. Welders typically work eight-hour shifts and a five-day week, but overtime is common. Welders often perform other duties like operating metal fabrication equipment and doing assembly work.
The more skills a welder develops, the more value and earning potential he has. For example, being able to weld, cut and fit up metals, and read weld symbols and prints will command a higher wage. Becoming certified in certain weld procedures also increases a welder‚Äôs wages and marketability.
Qualifications 
Welding is the quintessential blue-collar job. It is physically demanding, hot, dirty, and requires a high degree of skill. Other personal characteristics are good eyesight and hand eye coordination, good manual dexterity, and good concentration.
Training Community colleges offer affordable training for entry-level jobs in welding. Most programs are nine months, but my school also offers a sixteen-week work ready certificate in welding. Students learn common welding processes, thermal cutting processes, and blueprint reading. Unlike the typical ivory palace college professors, instructors are required to have a minimum of three years related and verifiable industrial experience. Job placement is also good.
Additional Facts 
Despite a decent paying skill in high demand, clueless parents and educators continue to dissuade young men from entering blue-collar trades like welding. The result has been an entire generation of young men ruined by hostile four-year colleges, worthless degrees, and insurmountable debt.
Perhaps you are a perceptive and bright young ROK reader considering a career change. In closing, consider these facts.
1. You will always have employment as a welder.
2. Welding skills are highly transferable. You can carry these skills to your next, and often higher paying job.
3. Unlike many white-collar corporate jobs of today, the average welder‚Äôs wages increase with skill. Overtime, merit increases, and production bonuses are common benefits for welders.
4. At the end of your shift, you can leave your job at the door.
5. Welding offers a level of creativity, solitude, and seeing the fruits of your labor. Studies show that welders, machinists, and other blue-collar trades have lower suicide rates than many white-collar professions.
6. Welding is often a ‚Äúgateway trade‚Äù into other even higher paying trades like machinist, multi-craft machinery maintenance, and millwright.
7. Welding is a male dominated occupation. Traditionalist men will find it offers some insulation and respite from the typical feminist diatribe and PC bullshit of today‚Äôs corporate world.
Conclusion How has welding benefited me? First, I developed reasoning skills, something that academia failed to do. I also developed a thorough understanding of how men do the dirty, nasty, and dangerous jobs in this life. Feminists and elitists can marginalize men all they want, but men risk their lives and health to build and maintain their shit.
Further, welding has opened some doors for me, mainly teaching. My ultimate goal is to teach welding full-time, a late life career change if you will, and one I hope will happen.

I live in America, and I am happily married, with kids. I do not write this because I am more manly, or intelligent, or successful than you; I am not. I write this to share the main key to my success: patriarchal, traditional religion. 
I am writing from my own religious convictions, which I believe are true. You are free to disagree, but you may still find value here. I have read the writings of other religions, and consider them ‚ÄúTrue Myths,‚Äù useful for their wisdom, even though I may disagree with their theology. Neomasculinity itself is a philosophy that can be accepted by people of different religions, or no religion. Modern Religion I‚Äôll find another church, thanks 
Modern religion is a feminized wasteland. God exists to impose obligations on men, and excuses women‚Äôs evil acts. Faith is blind, irrational, and collectivist. 
Men hate modern religion, which is why most churches in the West are demographically imbalanced toward women. Men are bored to death with touchy-feely sermons, endless committee meetings, female gossip, and the losers sitting in the pews around them. This is not how it should be. Patriarchal Religion That‚Äôs more like it. 
Patriarchal religion is interesting to men. It teaches that God is a man, creator of rationality, slayer of evil men, protector of the innocent: Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle. (Psalm 144:1) 
In male-led churches, women are taught to be respectful to their fathers, husbands, and legitimate authority. They understand that their role is to raise and care for children, and support their husband‚Äôs mission: Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. (Ephesians 5:22) 
In patriarchal religion, female sins, like rebellion, envy, dishonesty, hypergamy, dressing and acting like a whore, and ‚Äúhamstering‚Äù or rationalizing sin are condemned: When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. (Genesis 3:6) I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. (1 Timothy 2:9-10) And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. (1 Timothy 2:14)‚Äù This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve done nothing wrong.‚Äô (Proverbs 30:20) Finding A Virtuous Woman This is the unicorn I married. 
All women are tempted towards sins like envy, but not all women act on their impulses. In spite of what many observe in the West, I have met many virtuous women: few sexual partners before marriage, respectful, submissive to their husbands, physically fit, feminine, good mothers. Most are in the older generations, especially before the Boomers. Most are involved in traditional religion. There are fewer younger women who are virtuous, and every single one that I have met is involved in traditional religion. They tend to be more rural, from small churches. 
Traditional religion can be extremely helpful to finding and vetting women. It provides a community with certain values that you want in a woman, and it provides reliable references for a person‚Äôs character. A woman who spent her younger years ‚Äúout in the world‚Äù and came back at 29 be a ‚Äúborn-again-virgin‚Äù is a red flag, but a woman in her early 20s who teaches Sunday School and helps with the potluck dinners is far more likely to be wife material. The older women in the church will usually let you know if a woman is a whore. Patriarchal Religion Helps Control Women‚Äôs Sinful Tendencies With proper training, woman can be virtuous. 
Traditional religion acts as a curb (but not a cure) for women‚Äôs immoral, rebellious, destructive behavior. My wife goes to a women‚Äôs bible study group, where she often receives instruction from older religious women. This includes things like telling her to be submissive to me, lose weight and be healthy, not waste money, have cheerful sex on a regular basis, and to learn how to get some control over her emotions: Teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands. (Titus 2:3) 
One of my wife‚Äôs friends once corrected her attitude toward sex, saying: ‚Äúyou need to view your body as a sheath for your husband‚Äôs sword.‚Äù She now routinely thanks me after we have sex. I am not a natural alpha, but I have little fear that my wife is going to suddenly cut off sex if I have a minor slip up. Band Of Brothers We‚Äôve got your back, bro! Deus Vult! 
With this great power comes great responsibility. As a patriarch, I am commanded to lead my family, instructing my wife and kids on how to act properly, with genuine love for their well-being. I must be on top of my game, be physically fit, and think rationally when my wife is irrational. I attend a men‚Äôs Bible study, where we talk about leading as men. Every man in my group owns a gun, and we often go shooting together. 
We encourage, support, teach, and correct each other. I have had sharp, intense, discussions with my pastor and men in my church about my own character and life decisions. Things are handled like men, discussed in the open, with real-talk (not rhetorical bullshit), and masculine love and concern for each other. This has aided me in thinking deeply about my life, and correcting bad decisions I have made. 
Awhile back we helped another man who was on the verge of divorce. He was working 100 hours a week because he would not stand up to his employer, and had no energy to lead his family. We told him that the marriage counseling he was getting was bullshit (‚Äútalk about your feelings more!‚Äù), and that his slavish attitude toward his employer was making his wife lose respect for him. The women in our church also talked to his wife about choosing to be respectful and submissive, in spite of her rebellious emotions. 
He cut back hours at work, which enabled him able to be captain of his ship again. This, along with training his wife received, helped her become more respectful. Now, his wife is less of a bitch, and they have sex several times a week. I doubt this would have happened without patriarchal religion. Children I‚Äôve succeeded as a father! 
We see that our culture is toxic, feminized, and immoral. Men need a place to raise children apart from these toxins, and church is a great place to do this. My kids go to Sunday School classes where they are taught to be respectful to me, my wife, and legitimate adult authorities. We have several families with well-disciplined children that we can trust won‚Äôt corrupt our kids. My wife often takes the kids for play-dates so she can socialize with wholesome women, which is a great alternative to sitting around on social media all day. Conclusion Patriarchal, traditional religion will not change female nature, but it can help restrain it. This is how past generations maintained civilization. I can confidently say that traditional religion is the main reason I can maintain a happy marriage in this cesspool of a culture. Those who are not religious might consider other institutions that may provide similar support for their marriage and child-raising.";english;2016-11-04T14:03:58.966+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;The Importance Of Patriarchal Religion To Marriage And Childrearing;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

By 2050, it‚Äôs predicted the USA will no longer have a white majority, which in 1960 was 90%. For this, we can thank Ted Kennedy‚Äôs Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which the politicians swore up and down wouldn‚Äôt change the American ethnic composition. In Europe, due to declining native birth rates and mass immigration , this will eventually come to pass for several other nations later this century, all according to the Coudenhove-Kalergi Plan . The leftists, with their really big hearts , think all this will be wonderful. 
Globalism and cultural Marxism are the driving forces behind population replacement policies, but unawareness and apathy are almost as much of a problem . Some think that if Western civilization will go down the toilet, they should just ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù and enjoy the ride all the way down the tubes. Thanks to media propaganda and educational indoctrination, they have no idea that their own civilization is worth anything, and don‚Äôt have the slightest concern for their own posterity. Still, they‚Äôre pretty naive to believe that things can‚Äôt turn far worse within their own lifetimes. Why this is bad (for those who need reminding) In the future, is this going to get better, or worse? 
If trends continue unabated, the founding peoples will lose control over their destiny. History shows that when this happens, the results are not good. Pillaging and plundering is a more genteel affair in modern times (though not always ) but you‚Äôre still not going to like it. Will your new rulers say, ‚ÄúSince things have changed so much, how about we abolish Affirmative Action and set-asides to show we‚Äôve transcended race?‚Äù Don‚Äôt count on it. More likely, they‚Äôll double down on these preferential treatment programs, and come up with new ones, and you will have no chance to block the spoils systems. 
That‚Äôs just the beginning, too. The ‚Äú diversification ‚Äù of cities for the last several decades has been bad‚ÄîDetroit, need I say more?‚Äîand riots really are getting out of hand. Now imagine what it will be like when you have no hope of influencing things like Section 8 housing moving into your neighborhood, or if you‚Äôll get any real police protection. 
This is what we‚Äôre facing if the Aztl√°n crowd takes over the Southwest, the community agitators get in charge of the big cities, and together their constituency has an electoral majority controlling the Federal government. (Also remember that they‚Äôve been told since the 1960s that you‚Äôre evil oppressors responsible for all their problems.) Parts of ‚Äúflyover country‚Äù might be able to hold out for a while, but nothing short of forming their own country will stop the advance of ‚Äúprogress‚Äù. If it were ever to come to secession, they‚Äôll be surrounded, outnumbered, and outgunned. Let‚Äôs keep things from getting to that point. Is there any hope? ‚ÄúRefugees‚Äù have taken on the characteristics of invaders 
I‚Äôve painted a grim picture, but I have to be realistic. As for what will happen later, things only look worse; Jean Raspail‚Äôs Camp Of The Saints describes a bleak future like that. This isn‚Äôt just the USA on the line, but Western Europe too, and perhaps Eastern Europe and Australia in time. If we want to keep from disappearing into the endless night, the time to act is now. 
Sometimes, with luck, sovereignty can be regained: for example, the Spanish Reconquista, or the nations of the Balkans rising after a few centuries under the Turkish yoke. However, the results aren‚Äôt guaranteed; some nations may never recover. In these examples, the ‚Äúdhimmis‚Äù were subjugated under military occupation, but they were not outnumbered in their own lands. The founding populations must not allow themselves to be dispossessed in their own countries in the first place. 
Granted, the dark forces of globalism are very powerful‚Äîand they‚Äôd like us to think they‚Äôre invincible‚Äîbut they must be stopped. They also want you to think they‚Äôre smarter than you and know what‚Äôs good for you . (If they‚Äôd simply focus on getting richer, and cease their social engineering, they‚Äôd have far less to answer for.) Not only has our political establishment failed us, they‚Äôre working against the public . It won‚Äôt be easy, but we must reassert control over our destiny. Do we deserve to be dispossessed? Brainwashed SJWs welcoming their own destruction 
Some will even say‚Äîoften with haughty condescension‚Äîthat if we lose our countries, then we deserve this fate. Ignoring for a moment the sheer snottiness, as well as the ‚Äúmight makes right‚Äù argument incongruent with the usual rhetoric of fairness by the ‚Äúprepare to be assimilated, resistance is futile‚Äù crowd, let‚Äôs consider the following facts: In the 1920s, a Communist propaganda campaign was launched in the Western world. In the 1930s, this mutated into cultural Marxism and kicked into high gear during the 1960s. Most people have no idea of the scope of it all, or where things like political correctness came from. Only senior citizens remember what it was like living in a fairly normal country. Even fewer never grew up exposed to this propaganda in one form or another. The rest of us have been indoctrinated from an early age by the mass media and educational establishment. The Western political tradition lately is about openness and democracy. For this reason, we don‚Äôt conduct political change by torches and pitchforks these days. We play fair, even if our enemies often don‚Äôt . Further, political correctness encourages the ‚Äúdisadvantaged‚Äù to have solidarity, but vilifies the same in the majority. This is one reason why we‚Äôre on the defensive, and (for now) usually losing. Most people only have a vague idea about the extent of managed democracy and sheer corruption. Those against population replacement policies mostly put their faith in the mainstream opposition parties, not realizing that they‚Äôve sold out to deep-pockets globalists too. ‚ÄúMainstream‚Äù conservatism is a controlled opposition , providing token resistance at best. 
So with that extent of treachery, disinformation, limited options for resistance, and managed democracy, it‚Äôs grotesquely dishonest for the defeatists to tell us that we‚Äôre losing a fair fight! As for their opinion that we should just give up, I have one word: No. 
Whenever you hear the defeatists crowing that this is inevitable or that we ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù it, remember that they want to demoralize you and anyone else listening. (The same goes for when they tell you that loving your people and wanting your posterity to survive is ‚Äúhatred‚Äù.) Suppose someone is losing his home by a devious swindle, orchestrated by crooks widely lauded for their fairness, caring, and honesty. It would be the height of arrogance to tell the defrauded that he deserved it and should shut up about it and let it happen. The depopulation and population replacement agenda ‚ÄúFirst, the EU has to accept at least a million asylum-seekers annually for the foreseeable future‚Ä¶ The EU should provide 15,000 euros ($16,800) per asylum-seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, health-care and education costs‚Äîand to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states.‚Äù 
Don‚Äôt be fooled: this isn‚Äôt happening because some vague, invisible force called ‚Äúprogress‚Äù is pushing things inevitably in this direction. No, it‚Äôs being actively promoted by globalist interests that have adopted cultural Marxism as a means of control. 
Why are native fertility rates declining below replacement level? The major factors are: Women are encouraged to spend their 20s partying and their 30s trying to get rich in a cube farm. Encouraging them to to make starting a family last priority often leaves them very unhappy over the long term, and many will miss the chance to begin. Good economy tends to be positively correlated with higher fertility rates. During recessions, births go down. The implications are obvious. If less tax money was taken from working citizens for costly social services programs and spit-in-your-eye wars, then they‚Äôd be able to afford more children. Sending the guilty to prison (instead of bailing them out) when they crash the economy might be a good indirect measure too. About a third of American babies conceived end up aborted . (Thanks, feminism!) The same leftists who think this is wonderful will scream bloody murder whenever a savage killer on Death Row is executed, but all that‚Äôs another matter. 
Because of declining fertility rates, the globalists tell us that we must open the floodgates of Third World immigration to prop up the population and support the aging citizens. So they‚Äôve fed us poison, and to soothe the symptoms, they want to feed us another kind of poison. To hell with that! 
Granted, keeping Social Security going in the USA will be a challenge. Still, it‚Äôs pretty uncertain that newly-arriving immigrants‚Äîif they become the majority‚Äîwill be able or willing to support millions of elderly ‚Äúgringos‚Äù. As for future European retirees, will they be well cared for by ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù from Africa and the Middle East? The way things are now, many of them prefer rioting , looting, and collecting welfare over working. So these are going to be the people propping up the European retirement programs? 
Dispossession is inevitable only if we let it happen. For now, we must educate the rest of the public about what‚Äôs going on, and convince them that their future is worth saving and their posterity is worth preserving. Once we‚Äôve achieved critical mass, we can confront the political establishment and get the government to start working for us rather than against us What‚Äôs in it for us? Whenever someone writes that Western civilization is nothing but injustice and oppression, they‚Äôre using technology we invented to complain about us. 
It‚Äôs fashionable‚Äîespecially in academia‚Äîto bash Western civilization. We‚Äôre not perfect, but nobody else is either. The truth is that we‚Äôre a creative, dynamic, and industrious people. Some of us are under the impression that we don‚Äôt have any culture (only other people do) but that‚Äôs mistaken. I could spend all day listing our major artists, composers, poets, philosophers, writers, theologians, and the like, but I only would scratch the surface. 
Other cultures have made notable contributions‚Äîparticularly East Asia and the Middle East‚Äîbut the fact is that the majority of science and technology that makes life comfortable today originated in the Western world. Electricity, motorized transportation, refrigeration, telecommunications, computers (need I go on)? Yep, that was us. We shared our medical advances with the rest of the world, increasing longevity and quality of life around the globe. Whether the world‚Äôs future looks more like Star Trek or more like Blade Runner may have a lot to do with whether or not our people survive. 
Finally, most of us are going to live out our lives in our native countries. Do we want them to stay the same nations we grew up in? Some time in the future, today‚Äôs youth will be running the show while we‚Äôre elderly. What kind of a place do we want it to be by then?

First, Megyn Kelly pulled the sexist card, then it was his undisclosed tax returns, then his comments on John McCain, then making fun of crippled reporters, then his reading of Mein Kampf, then his remarks about dating his daughter.
Then accusations of racism from former employees, his usage of eminent domain, hiring of immigrants and other questionable practices, the Trump University scandal, his blunder on abortion, old comments on drug decriminalization and gun control, his relationship with the Clintons and the DC insiders, his comments on refugees and illegal immigrants, the Khan incident. And, of course, the pussy-grabbing scandal.
Surely this time, it will sink his campaign, won‚Äôt it ? And yet each time Teflon Don deflects dirt more dexterously than ghetto trash trying escape alimony payments. Nothing seems to be able to stop him, not that his opponents will ever stop trying.
Trump has the fantastic ability to escape unharmed from what would clearly destroy any career politician. Howard Dean‚Äôs ‚ÄúYee-haw‚Äù was enough to end his bid for the Democratic candidate in 2004, and yet Trump can call for an end to Muslim refugees, be accused of grabbing women by their loins, and end up being praised for it by the masses, while the mainstream media spew their bile 24/7.
What has allowed Trump to maneuver so nimbly against these accusations is the unprecedented role of internet media in elections, including being able to reach people directly through Twitter and a lack of trust in traditional media, as well as his bigger-than-life persona letting him get away with what others would be lynched for.
But that‚Äôs the story for another article. I would rather talk about something else. Particularly, is there anything that could stop him? The answer will surprise you as it goes against all conventional wisdom.
Yes, but it‚Äôs not what you think.
Trump‚Äôs weak spot 
One of the biggest problems with defeating Trump is that unlike other politicians, political scandals not only seem to not affect him, but they even aid him. There is a saying that every anti-Trump meme is also a pro-Trump meme.
Trump has mastered political antifragility, which causes him to only strengthen when opponents try to destroy him. Trump has defeated the left‚Äôs ‚Äúno platform for fascists‚Äù mentality by saying things so outrageous they have no option but to report on him.
So, the left cannot choose to not cover him and let him wallow in obscurity like they did with Ron Paul. Neither can they attack him, for each of their attacks only make him more popular.
One memorable movie quote I remember went something like this: ‚ÄúEvery man has a weak spot. First you try to buy him with money, then women, then you go for his family, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, well, a bullet always does the job.‚Äù Unfortunately, unlike other political losers, Don does not need other people‚Äôs money, nor does he lack female attention, and his family is smart and probably safe from violence.
But this isn‚Äôt an article about (God forbid) Donald Trump getting assassinated. That would stop Trump, but not the Trump train. Trump is more than a man. Trump is an idea. He is the avatar of discontent of all those opposed to progressive ideology. He would become a martyr, thus raising the hatred for his opponents to a fever pitch which might alter America‚Äôs consciousness forever. Trump‚Äôs enemies can‚Äôt afford that.
So if ignoring Trump does not work, throwing dirt at him does not work, bribing him doesn‚Äôt work and even killing him won‚Äôt work, than what is left? The answer might surprise you.
You see Trump‚Äôs power comes from his contrarianism. He is not a candidate, he is an anti-candidate. People don‚Äôt just vote FOR Trump they vote AGAINST Hillary, Obama, Progressives and Cuckservatives. He is the wrecking ball who the injured working class and all non-liberal whites as well as minorities not completely in love in with progressive Marxist ideology want to use against the establishment.
So what can be done to stop him ? 
Well, let‚Äôs ask ourselves what makes Trump popular ? His brashness, his anti-PC attitudes, his anti-elitism, his not being a part of the Establishment hacks, his being ‚Äúnot one of them,‚Äù his being different.
So if that is what gives Trump strength, it would make sense that to weaken him, you would have to present him as the opposite of that. To present him as being nothing special, to make him look boring and weak. To present him as just another PC-drone.
They‚Äôve claimed nonstop that Trump is the next Hitler and that he will start building concentration camps and sexually assaulting random women by grabbing their cock pockets and will obliterate Muslims and minorities with Right WiNg Death Squad robots.
Instead they could have claimed that he is just weakling trying to act tough, and that he won‚Äôt deliver anything. That he is in love with political correctness and respects women. That he is a progressive‚Äôs best choice. That he will bring four more years of Obama.
That of course would present it‚Äôs own difficulties. In the age of online media, the monopoly of physical press has been broken. When news circulates at the speed of minutes rather than hours and days, it would be very hard for the establishment media to accomplish this. It is very hard to call Trump ordinary and boring when his statements break so many taboos.
Yet, as difficult as it may have been, at the very least it would have had a chance of success, as small as it was. Calling him sexist, racist, and other mean words did nothing to stop him, and instead only made him more popular with the masses. Some of these incidents have made Donald seem human and it made people trust him more. Showing his flaws had the opposite effect as intended, as those who hated him already needed no extra ammo, but those who liked him were either left indifferent, or what‚Äôs worse excited by his statements.
At worst a few moderates had doubts set in their mind, however considering what short attention span undecided voters have, his stellar performance at the second debate clearly made them forget about the statement and maybe even convinced them to focus on Bill‚Äôs sexual misdeeds instead.
Why haven‚Äôt his opponents used this against him? 
This brings us to the final point of this article. Why haven‚Äôt his opponents used this against him? Have they not the brains to figure this out? Hard to believe, considering the amount of money being poured into think tanks.
No, the truth is like that the strategy was forsaken because of the side-effects it would have on their own camp. Should his opponents try to attack him as another PC drone, they would be also attacking themselves. Just like Hillary trying to paint Trump as sex offender only made it easier for Trump to point at Bill‚Äôs sexual indiscretions. As it has been said in the mighty book of Kek : ‚Äúthee that dwell in glass lodgings shall not propel sedimentary formations‚Äù The Prophecy of Kek, Chapter 4 : Verse 20. 
Attacking Trump for being multicultural, politically correct, weak, inefficient, or a shill would only shed light on the establishment‚Äôs own weakness.
This means that in order to draw voters away from Trump they would have to claim Trump loves multiculturalism, anti-racism, open borders, free trade, globalism and offer another candidate who would be even more extreme than him on these crucial issues.
Using this strategy against Trump, even if it was successful, would be a Pyrrhic victory for his opponents, as cuckservatives would have to acknowledge they can‚Äôt woo supporters with talks about reducing taxes and bringing back Reaganism. The truth is, the future is bleak for Reagan-Bush-Cuck wing of the GOP. Even if they were to win the election, they would lose the war.
The left has won the cultural war not just by winning elections, but by cultural meta-warfare. Instead of moderating their message in attempt to win election, they used popular culture and mass media to push liberal values to the masses, and so the right wing had no option, but do concessions, dropping people who opposed civil rights, women‚Äôs liberation and closed borders.
To put it simply, the battle was lost even before Trump came‚ÄîTrump was the match that ignited the powder keg. He simply mobilized people, and said what others kept in private, but always wanted to say and now there is no turning back.
The elites cannot choose to ignore popular will and still win elections anymore. They will have to reform the GOP to account for their constituency‚Äôs desire or risk ending in the dust bin of history. There is no longer the option to charm the sheeple with talks about low taxes, open borders and the awfulness of bigotry. They will have to, at least, nominally give something back to the people to stay in power.
As one wise commenter on this site once said : ‚ÄúTrump may be a liar like the rest of them, but at least he is saying the right lies.‚Äù
The next thing people on the manosphere and the alt-right will have to look after will be Trump-like figures who will copy Trump‚Äôs rhetoric, but will fail to deliver any solutions. Or they will try to co-opt and redirect that anger. But for now, for the first time in more than 50 years, we are winning the culture war .

The underlying reason that this topic is the focus of a great deal of discussion is because its roots are deeply steeped in both cowardice and betrayal.
While our readership is well acquainted with the political and social implications of cuckservatism, there is also a need to also discuss its behavioral roots. To accomplish this task, I used my social media accounts to examine connections of mine who displayed all of the classic red flags associated with cuckservatism. I then searched for common traits that they possessed based on the nature of their rants or posts.
The three characteristics listed below represent key factors which, in my opinion, are necessary for any individual to transform from an otherwise normal person into a cuck. If we can understand these factors, this will enable us to develop a more comprehensive strategy for rendering them irrelevant, apart from merely ignoring them.
Political Naivet√© Nothing screams political naivety more than voting for a last minute candidate who considers himself a ‚Äúconservative‚Äù alternative to Trump.
This factor represents the first step that one must take to become a cuckservative, because it entails believing in a series of premises that are patently false. Political naivet√© can include simpler forms, such as believing in the wage gap or that illegal immigrants are natural republicans. Conversely, political naivet√© can also be more complex, in that an individual afflicted with it might believe in equality as a virtue or that a democratic two party system is the best form of government. 
A perfect example of this can be seen in my friends and associates who blindly believe in the Constitution. These individuals refuse to vote for anyone other than a ‚Äúconstitutionalist,‚Äù and their sole metric for judging candidates is the implications of an obscure constitutional issue that only they care about. This perspective is indicative of political naive√© because the globalists who run our political system jettisoned any belief in the Constitution and rule of law decades ago. For them, the Constitution is merely a convenient rubber stamp used to justify unpopular political decisions. 
Accordingly, anyone who votes ONLY for candidates with such narrow viewpoints is naively playing into the hands of globalists because they fail to understand that the Constitution will only function in a nation that‚Äôs virtuous and willing to abide by its principles. 
If the United States continues on its current demographic track, we will eventually import a new population that not only despises original American values, but would also actively vote to eliminate them. The Constitution will provide no protections if this occurs, because these people will simply ignore it, invoking arguably the most important phrase in all of American legal history . 
To fail to understand these stakes when considering one‚Äôs voting patterns, instead opting to emulate the local revolutionary war re-enactors, is a hallmark trait of a cuckservative. 
Lack Of Self Confidence A Cuckservative would never get this far.
Lack of self-confidence, and the feelings of doubt that serve as its foundation, represents a second symptom of cuckservatism, which is why Return Of Kings has countless articles on how to acquire and maintain self-confidence as a form of preventative medicine. 
Doubts as to one‚Äôs chances of success, coupled with fear and the innate need for self-preservation, can easily shatter most people. In such moments of weakness, it‚Äôs very easy for a person to do a 180 and to do something that they would normally find revolting. Conversely, if one steadfastly believes in their convictions and themselves, their self-confidence will become stronger. This is true even in situations when seemingly the entire world is against them. 
The following clip is from an interview that Jeb Bush did with Lester Holt during the Republican Primary, and is an excellent illustration of how a lack of self-confidence can lead to powerlessness and a lack of control over one‚Äôs surroundings. 
From the very beginning of this clip, Jeb‚Äôs lack of self confidence is readily apparent. Whether it was the fact that he was too far hunched over in his seat, his attempts to curb his nervousness by forcing himself to smile or laugh, or the fact that he rarely made eye contact with Lester Holt, any ability that he has to project himself was undermined by his body language.
An even deeper sign of his lack of self-confidence begins at 0:45 in the video, when Holt proceeds to ask him why he didn‚Äôt frame the Charleston shooting as an act of ‚Äúracism.‚Äù In this situation, if asked such a question in any setting, an individual has one of two choices. If he is self-confident, he would turn the question back on Lester Holt by saying that racism is a social construct and the only people who care about it are limp-wristed losers.
However, if one is like Jeb and lacks self-confidence, their response to this situation will be to immediately try to ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù by acknowledging the premise raised by someone like Lester Holt and then spend the rest of the interview trying to show that they‚Äôre not a bad person. This was the approach that Jeb used, and it demonstrated to Lester Holt that he was weak, which then led to Lester forcing Jeb to backtrack and question his own decision to support Stand Your Ground laws during his tenure as Florida‚Äôs governor.
A lack of self-confidence, as evidenced by Jeb‚Äôs failure to retain control over his surroundings during his interview with Lester Holt, highlights a classic character trait shared by cuckservatives. The only answer that I can come up with, as to why this trait is so prevalent, is that it might be a product of their childhood that they haven‚Äôt been able to get over.
In a way, the archetypal cuck was likely bullied or mistreated as a child, but has never learned how to fight back or to love being hated by others. Because of this, they never developed the necessary level of self-confidence to succeed in life, which eventually translates over to their politics.
They Want To Be Friends With Everyone How to destroy a political movement established by one‚Äôs father in one fell swoop.
Having grown up in the leftist Northeast, and considering that I still live and work there, I‚Äôm used to being in the political minority. My coping mechanisms for this situation consisted of (unknowingly) embracing key tenets of the Alternative Right, and knowing how to pick my political fights. Additionally, I also resolved to never be friendly with or ever trust anyone from the political left, a decision that has been vindicated over the last several years. 
Unfortunately, my approach is not a popular one amongst political dissidents in my region. This is because many of them, having grown up with leftists, simply view their political disagreements as a series of gentlemanly differences that they can put aside over a few beers. They refuse to believe that leftists and SJWs hate anyone who even slightly disagrees with them and, like women, view weak men as easy targets. 
Accordingly, when faced with the choice of staying true to their beliefs or ‚Äúmoderating‚Äù them in order to ensure that they get invited to the next sushi night, art showing or paint nite; the cuckservatives that I know will roll over every time. Specifically, they‚Äôll profess support for third party ‚Äúlibertarian‚Äù or ‚Äúconstitutional‚Äù candidates, while supporting a slightly less-liberal version of their leftist friends‚Äô politics. 
This tendency demonstrates a key principle that most cuckservatives subconsciously hold: they want to be liked by everyone, and will therefore do anything they can to make this happen, even if it means betraying themselves and their own beliefs in the process. When does adopting this attitude ever lead to success in life? 
If a child keeps getting beat up by a schoolyard bully, should they cower in the bully‚Äôs presence and act as his lackey in order to avoid getting hurt? We all know that such an approach is worthless and that the only way to respond is to fight back, yet these people adopt the same approach when dealing with the political equivalent of a schoolyard bully. Perhaps their reason for trying to be friends with globalists and trying to appease them by being moderate stems from the way in which they handled problems in childhood, however that issue itself is another topic that deserves discussion by itself. 
Is There A Remedy For These Character Flaws? Even if we understand these characteristics, and can think of active ways to subvert cuckservatism, we will not be entirely successful. Most people who fall under this category have been psychologically conditioned to act this way, meaning that much of our attempts to open their eyes will fall on deaf ears. I have no sympathy for these people because they‚Äôve never had the internal drive or fortitude necessary to overcome adversity, and would rather wallow in misery while also pulling others into the abyss with them. 
However, there are always a couple that might show potential. These individuals might only be seen by us as cuckservatives because they imitated others around them, while lacking a positive role model that could show them the truth. The greatest service we can do for these select few is to identify them and prove that there is a viable alternative .
If 25 cents a day can supposedly help a starving African family have rice for six months, then us acting as positive role models to our weaker brethren will help them immeasurably while also advancing our own cause.

3. Did you think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being friends with a girl? If yes, you‚Äôre bluer than the ocean. 
4. Did you run to the nearest bathroom and throw up in the toilet at his display of supreme betatude? If yes, you‚Äôre red pill.

One problem with swallowing the red pill is that you will get offended at just about everything that mainstream people enjoy. You can no longer digest their media, enjoy their viral videos, or even have a normal conversation with a blue piller.

Andr√© is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 5, 2016 Girls 
The Paris catacombs are a place dear to my heart. Born in this very city, I had a front row seat to see it turn into a giant museum. Every wealthy asshole wanting his own piece of the ‚Äúcity of lights,‚Äù and Paris being one of the most visited cities in the world , I could see year after year the streets taken over by luxury clothing shops and expensive venues. The middle and lower classes have been pushed aside by rising living costs so that the rich globalists, the bobos and a never-ending trail of tourists could stroll around. 
Yet, go twenty meters below the Haussmanian hurdle, and you will find something very different. 
South of the Seine, the lands have been deeply dug to extract building stones. Most of the voids have been filled since, but more than a hundred kilometres of mine galleries are still there. Exploring the place is officially forbidden. Which is a good thing, as one can go there officiously, provided one knows how to enter and not get lost in the labyrinth, without bothering with swarms of tourists or wasting money in an overpriced bar. 
Officially prohibited, actually more or less self-managed by a loose community of cataphiles , the Catacombs are one of the most interesting places today in Paris. It allows for genuine explorations and friendly meetings while also teaching some masculine virtues to those who venture there seriously. 
The underground network being fragile and the officials not enjoying when too many visitors tread on their jurisdiction, the cataphiles have a complex relationship with exposing it. On the one hand, we like to show the place and share its atmosphere with passionate newcomers; on the other, we are afraid that too much exposition will attract too many visitors and stifle the officials‚Äô relative toleration for unofficial activities. 
Well, today, other cataphiles won‚Äôt chastise me for mentioning the topic in public, for this has been already made recently by an attention whore of international scope. Alison Teal, a Hawaiian 28 or 29 years old girl, made a show of herself down there and sent ludicrous photos to the Daily Mail . ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm here to teach you about protecting the planet, y‚Äôknow‚Äù ‚ÄúI love bringing surfboards in places without waves. By the way, I‚Äôm the feminine Indiana Jones, especially with the help of a crew I‚Äôll never give credit to. Follow me on Instagram and YT!‚Äù 
Here we are not talking about attention whoring lightly. The Daily Mail photos already tell much: a blond girl in a pink bikini carries a pink surfboard in a narrow underground network where there is, by definition, no waves to surf at all, to take some photos of herself, herself, herself, and a bit of the catacombs, as they could be used as the setting of the latest of Alison‚Äôs Adventures‚Ñ¢. I‚Äôm not joking. These ‚Äúadventures‚Äù are literally Hitler a trademark. 
Since she was at least 18, Teal seems to have taken advantage from the nomadic lifestyle of her parents to make photos, movies, and promote herself heavily along the way. With the help of her dad, a well-connected photographer and self-promoter who claims to master yoga, she got a bunch of awards and media promotion. Long-haired Alison was thus handed a niche that allows her to travel the world, take pictures of herself in various places, and claim to be concerned about the environment. 
Her r√©sum√© shows a massive ego associated to minor lies. ‚ÄúThe world was my school and playground‚Äù‚ÄîI guess smaller places would be too small for her giant ego, and this may explain why she suffered from claustrophobia under Paris, as we are to see below. Between name-droppings, references to media awards and other big pictures of Alison, Teal, and Alison Teal, we learn she was styled ‚Äúthe ‚ÄòFemale Indiana Jones‚Äô by Time Magazine (2015) and the ‚ÄòOprah of Adventure‚Äô by The Huffington Post (2016).‚Äù Really? 
Actually, Teal said to the HuffPo she aspired to be ‚Äúthe Oprah of adventure‚Äù in 2014 before branding herself as ‚Äúthe female Indiana Jones‚Äù to the Time a year later (2015, not 2016). Then she said on Twitter and on her r√©sum√© how they had referred to her as such. Not a big lie, but a lie indeed. By the way, she also branded herself a ‚ÄúTarzan child‚Äù in the HuffPo interview. Would someone who really ‚Äúgrew up in the wild‚Äù be so obsessed with linking herself to famous icons? Excerpt from the HuffPo article, 05/20/2014. The same articles adds she is a ‚Äúself-described ‚ÄòTarzan child.'‚Äù Excerpt from the Time article, 11/08/2015. Named by Time Magazine‚Ä¶ or self-styled? And now on her r√©sum√©. Not only does she lie by misattributing to famous media outlets self-characterizing and lavishly flattering labels, but she can‚Äôt even put the right years while referring to said media pieces. 
So, self-styled ‚Äúfemale Indiana Jones,‚Äù no less, went through what seems to be a joint undertaking with the Daily Mail by descending into the Paris catacombs with the symbols of her Adventures‚Ñ¢, namely a pink bikini and a surfboard. The English tabloid released the photos, video, and testimony of Indiana-Jones-In-A-Bikini-Surfing-The-Catacombs the 30 th of October. Days after, a bunch of French outlets copied the Mail content, often translating it verbatim . 
What struck me first are the stunning inaccuracies the tabloid published. First, the Mail claims Teal went 150 meters below the ground, whereas the actual depth of the Catacombs goes between 10 and 30 meters depending on where you are in the network. Can‚Äôt Indiana Jane tell the difference between 30 and 150 meters? 
Second, she also claimed to have lacked oxygen and witnessed the water level suddenly rising. This is at best extremely unlikely. The water levels can change from month to month and even from week to week, but to my knowledge it never changes abruptly in seconds. As for the oxygen issue, I have witnessed some only two times: at a big party, when so many people were in the same room that there was not enough oxygen to light a cigarette, and from claustrophobic newcomers who could not stand the place. 
Either she completely made up the sudden water change and oxygen issues in order to give her story a sensational aspect, or, more likely, got a panic attack due to claustrophobia, but preferred to twist it into a grandiose plot rather than acknowledging her own limitations. The Mail just ate that up and published without question. They did not ask any actual cataphile for sure. Had they done so, anyone with a decent experience of the catacombes could have told them what I just wrote above. 
I also noticed from her quotes that she does not mention anyone from her crew, gives no credit to the men who opened the manhole cover, helped her go down the humid ladder, showed her the way, filmed her‚Ä¶ She would never have found the entrance if no one already in the know had accepted to be her guide. Neither could she lift manhole covers of more than a hundred kilograms with her thin arms‚Äîeven the round butt she likes to display couldn‚Äôt do that. The first photo displayed by the Mail. Notice how she strategically displays (some of) her butt. 
I could bet she did not have sex with any of the guys who enabled her display to happen. As Julius Evola hinted, she is likely the kind of woman to whom ‚Äúthe possibilities of physical love are often not as interesting as the narcissistic cult of her body, or as being seen with as many or as few clothes as possible‚Äù (Evola, Revolt Against the Modern World , chap.20). 
In this respect, the only thing that makes Teal ‚Äúspecial‚Äù compared to all other look-at-me twats is the adventurous label she tries to put on herself. Exploiting people and places to garner attention is definitely not special. Yet, a lot of comments have noticed this behind the weird mix of glamour and pseudo-adventure: some are offended that she treaded on bones, i.e. remnants of real past men, in a pink bikini. Doing so is not only a proof of bad taste and self-aggrandizing mania‚Äîit is also utterly disrespectful. 
This is indeed a blatant example of pussy pass . Imagine going to Hawaii, bringing a skateboard at a local cemetery and start skateboarding over the graves in a pink throng. What do you expect would happen? You would probably get beaten by locals, and if the media gave you attention at all, they would label you as a disturbed troll or something like that. All this, I think, would be fair. But when a self-important Oprah Jane of super-adventure does the same, the mainstream media reacts completely differently and celebrates her without the least hint of criticism. 
Though she treading and surfing on bones of actual past people is not very respectful for sure, I think especially appalling the outlook Teal seems to carry on the place. The Catacombs are just another background for Alison Adventures‚Ñ¢. Whole places, some loaded with historical and spiritual significance, are reduced to a set for the egotic show of another vapid character. The entire world was her school, or so she said, meaning that the world is turned into a mixture of Disneyland and Hollywood studio where her picture can stroll around. Some weeks ago, Alison Teal was busy showing herself near an erupting volcano. Notice another strategic part-display of her butt. 
Usual newcomers to the Catacombs come there with a genuine interest in the place. They come to find out, sometimes drink, and have an actual adventure. They cannot help but feel some humility, perhaps even awe, when meeting with the bones of millions of nameless dead, most if not all of them having lived before the nineteenth century, and having been carried there so that Paris could grow. 
This is very different from using the place to play adventure, treading on bones in a rather inappropriate outfit, depending on a crew of real cataphiles but forgetting to give them the slightest credit, and showing utter carelessness to the historical and spiritual significance of the place, all so that Alison‚Äôs Ego Adventures‚Ñ¢ Show continues. 
As you can see above, a lot of the comments are negative‚Äîespecially those from cataphiles ‚Äîand Teal has discreetly withdrawn the video of her trail from YouTube, putting it into private mode. 
Teal‚Äôs circus has at least one merit: it symbolizes pretty well one of the worst aspects of the Westernization of the world. In the West, there is no wilderness, no sacredness, no magic. There are tons of potential places for tourism, but ultimately, all these places are losing their soul and turning into Disneylands. The Catacombs are worth it because they are definitely not so, and should never be. 
Fortunately, there can be some immanent justice. The wave of criticism under Teal‚Äôs disrespectful show is well deserved. More harshly, a young libtard who thought she could hitchhike through Middle East to prove Muslims peaceful got raped and killed by the ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù ones she theatrically claimed to care about. The event shew, or should have shown, that the world is not a giant kindergarten for Western ‚Äústrong and independent‚Äù narcissists. 
In a world of self-marketing and self-centred cunts, everyone is too busy caring about one‚Äôs image and about meaningless representations to truly care about a place or about family members. 
Truly respectable women are not the ones we spot the most easily, and true cataphiles are often discreet as well. Your humble servant bathed there before Teal pretended to ‚Äúsurf‚Äù the place, but I would definitely not exhibit myself treading on bones in a pink thong";english;2016-11-05T20:40:33.135+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;American Woman In Bikini Desecrates French Catacombs For Her ‚ÄúFemale Indiana Jones‚Äù Brand;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Via Breitbart : 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was rushed offstage at a Reno, Nevada campaign rally as a protester in the audience was involved in an extended incident near the stage. 
It was not immediately clear what was occurring in the crowd, but several members of what appeared to be law enforcement or U.S. Secret Service jumped down into the area where the protester was, as could be seen on Right Side Broadcasting Network‚Äôs video livestream of the event. 
Video of Trump being rushed off stage was posted online: 
In the video it appears Trump pauses to look out into the crowd for the event disrupter. Two U.S. Secret Service agents can be seen rushing in to remove Trump from the stage and two other agents also facilitate his removal. 
During his absence someone announced to the crowd that Trump would return. The protester was eventually seen being removed from the crowd, although there appeared to be a struggle with several law enforcement or Secret Service agents to secure the protester‚Äôs removal. It was several minutes before Trump was able to take the stage again. 
As Trump returned to the stage, he thanked the crowd, which cheered him back. 
‚ÄúNobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped, never ever be stopped,‚Äù said Trump. Here is the man in question, in handcuffs, being searched by officers after he was escorted out of the rally area. pic.twitter.com/pjoMCtM39K";english;2016-11-06T05:08:22.861+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;Donald Trump Rushed Off Stage In Reno After Possible Assassination Attempt;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

The usual reason given is that the increased mass is simply a ‚Äúdead weight‚Äù, while those with a little bit more knowledge will explain that lifting will develop ‚Äúslow twitch‚Äù muscles over the ‚ÄúFast twitch‚Äù muscles needed for sprinting, jumping, punching, and kicking.
I am here to tell you that the ‚Äúcommon wisdom‚Äù is completely wrong-when done properly, weightlifting will not impede your speed, and will in fact enhance your speed and explosiveness!
Anecdotes Perhaps you‚Äôve heard of this man?
That is of course Jamaica‚Äôs Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world, and holder of multiple Olympic records. Also worth noting is that in an interview, Mr. Bolt revealed that he squats 400 pounds, and at least partially attributes his nigh inhuman speed to his training regimen. And he‚Äôs not the only speed athlete who this can be said of-look at any Olympic class sprinter, they are all quite muscular fellows.
Similarly, other athletic disciplines (that‚Äôs ‚Äúathletics‚Äù in the specific rather than general sense, I‚Äôm using the European term for what my countrymen call ‚Äútrack and field‚Äù) have claimed to utilize weightlifting in their training, such as the long jump and the hurdles. Or, you can take my word for it: at my best I had a one rep max squat of 320 pounds, and had a 38 inch vertical leap (I am judging this by my ability to perform a standing jump over 2nd-highest position hurdles, which are measured at 38 inches ).
In fact, many world-level athletes of all disciplines are utilizing Olympic style weightlifting to develop speed and powe r.
Anyway you slice it, compound weight training is a fantastic supplement to all athletes, even those who seemingly don‚Äôt need that raw brute strength.
The Science As I elaborated in this article , as well as in the free PDF I offer to subscribers to my website (the subscription sign-up is on the front page) there‚Äôs more than one type of way to be athletic. More accurately, there are three, speaking purely in terms of muscular and/or nervous system function, so this does not include hand-to-eye coordination or other skills related to team sports. These three things can, loosely, correlate to the three types of muscle fibers-Red‚Äîor slow‚ÄîOxidative, Fast Glycolytic-or White-, and Fast Oxidative. Rather than rehash an article that I‚Äôve already written, we will focus on the white muscle, the fast glycolytic. This is the type of muscle you want to be training for if you want to develop sprinting speed or a high vertical leap.
Or, to put this into terms of Newton‚Äôs second law of motion, Acceleration=Force/Mass, ie: the amount of muscular force you can exert, divided by your body weight=how fast you can accelerate. And yes, I am aware that there‚Äôs probably a more mathematically accurate way of putting this.
Which Exercises To Do? It is at this point that you‚Äôre probably asking which exercises you should train to develop those physical skills you desire. If you read my articles regularly, you will know what I am likely to say-compound free weight lifting!
In fact, I‚Äôll go out on a limb and say if you don‚Äôt know which exercise you should do to develop a certain physical trait, you should always default to a compound lift unless you receive some further information that says otherwise. Training for speed or vertical leap is no exception to this rule.
If you are looking for sheer running speed and leaping ability, the power lifts that hit the lower body are most effective: deep ‚ÄúAss to grass‚Äù squats, deadlifts, and the clean and jerk are used by professional athletes to great effect.
Similarly, if you want the ability to throw a ball or punch harder, upper body compound lifts are the key: bench presses, overhead presses and, yes, the clean and jerk, will see you through.
So for those of you who are afraid that your athletic performance will be somehow impeded by heavy weightlifting, nothing could be further from the truth.

Many of you are probably familiar with Fred On Everything , a member of the old guard when it comes to the fight against feminism. His Hooking Up article gives a birds-eye view of how feminism corrupted women, in a way that only a senior citizen who has seen it all can elucidate. 
What I don‚Äôt get is, why are gals bitching? This is the world they wanted. They clawed and scratched and burned their bras and had court cases and threw fits to get exactly what they have. They hated men because, they said, men weren‚Äôt letting them copulate frantically like men had always wanted them to. Men, or more likely their mothers, didn‚Äôt let them make themselves unattractive by dressing like hod-carriers and swearing like sailors. Finally men gave in and now women hate them for that . Whatever happened to gratitude? [‚Ä¶] 
Sally Sue might have teeth like pearls and brains and perky tits and a wacky sense of humor and actually be quite a prize, but sex trumps art. If Sally didn‚Äôt say Yes, she knew that Greta would. Women had commoditized themselves. It was a marvelous thing for the testosterone wads we think of as college boys. [‚Ä¶] 
‚ÄúAll you want is sex!‚Äù 
‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶what else have you got?‚Äù or ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù 
Or, ‚ÄúMarriage? Why? Would sex be better? Would food taste better? I don‚Äôt get it.‚Äù 
Or, ‚ÄúMarriage doesn‚Äôt make sense. Do you want to eat in the same restaurant all your life?‚Äù 
Women weren‚Äôt happen then and aren‚Äôt happy now. Trying to please them will just sacrifice what you want while giving no guarantee that they‚Äôll be content, yet we still have beta males and white knights fighting among each other to appease the unappeasable. Will they collectively realize their folly? 
Maybe a more relevant question is if we want them to wake up. When I‚Äôm looting the Best Buy after a hurricane, I don‚Äôt want to compete with other looters.

Are you sure? Big Brother Google says ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you look at this story about alternative lifestyles about men who have realized what terrible misogynists they are for having sexual desires?‚Äù rather than searching for articles on for pick-up artistry .
Sooner rather than later, all Internet roads will lead to the same New World Order Socialist philosophy.
As profiling of Internet users becomes more prolific and the algorithms more sophisticated in the coming years, the news and information we search for will be tailored to slowly ‚Äúnudge‚Äù us one way or the other politically, one small step at a time.
The management of the information we get to read is already in its infancy.
Why do you think that ‚Äúfree‚Äù app on your phone that only performs a few functions swells in size with each ‚Äúupdate‚Äù that is released? Do you really think they give a damn about your privacy and are plugging security holes? Hell no. The apps we download are moving from useful, low-resource using services to resource hogs (necessitating an upgrade in processing power every year or two) because they only provide us with a ‚Äúfree‚Äù service in order to hook us so the apps can gather information about everything we‚Äôve ever written on our devices for social engineers and marketing flacks. The apps are becoming more sophisticated in the way they monitor everything we do ‚Äì which is why the apps need all that memory size.
And soon, apps will be gathering information about everything we‚Äôve ever said aloud by using the built in microphones on each device and speech recognition technology. CIA agents confirm microphones can easily be activated even when a device is switched completely off.
This type of information will be collected in giant databases such as the Utah Data Center, with the ultimate goal being the corporate-government complex knowing more about us than we know about ourselves.
Big Brother Was So Yesterday Orwell‚Äôs Big Brother idea never could have imagined the insidious nature of today‚Äôs information technology
Today‚Äôs information technology has put Big Brother on steroids.
The Waking Times details this frightful world that is already emerging as anyone who pays attention knows search engines are already tailoring information to what we search for and even what we text people about.
‚ÄúMr. X, we‚Äôve studied the little virtual bubble you live in, and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth.‚Äù
Most of the time, the information one will see in this Internet bubble will be customized to suit a person‚Äôs interests. This is why Facebook relentlessly pushes the ‚ÄúLike a page or product‚Äù portion of its web site. This information is used to build a profile of a person that ultimately will be able to accurately predict the color of their next bowel movement.
If a man is interested in non-GMO foods advertising and ‚Äúnews‚Äù stories will be tailored to inform him of grocers who sell organics and about news from ‚Äúapproved‚Äù outlets with stories written on the topic. Most of the time, this will be insidious advertising and ads disguised as information.
‚ÄúHello, audience. We‚Äôre going to pitch you on becoming full-fledged obsessed consumers, as if there is no other worthy goal in life‚Äîand then we‚Äôre going to profile you from top to bottom, to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are, so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands‚Ä¶‚Äù
The Utah Data Center is designed to store exabytes of information on ‚Äúall forms of communication, including emails, cell phone calls, and Internet searches, as well as all types of personal data trails‚Äîparking receipts, travel itineraries, and bookstore purchases‚Äù
As another example: Okay, we know you are interested in traditional gender roles. We ( the information managers like Facebook and Google) will now to find news stories and customize the information you get to read online in order to cause you to doubt the validity of your beliefs. The ultimate goal is to slowly but steadily move you away from believing in traditional gender roles to believing in militant feminism without you realizing what we have done.
This type of information management is even more insidious than outright censorship, as it will be designed to steer everyone towards what the controllers of society want us to think and buy, no matter how far from the ideal consumer and fellow traveler we may be.
Think of it as a game of Plinko on The Price is Right, in which all chips ultimately fall into the ‚Äúperfect, braindead consumer‚Äù slot at the bottom of the maze. The social engineers‚Äô dream is a world of nothing but sexless consumers who perform mindless work in meaningless jobs, whose only outlets for pleasure are shopping and eating out and other State-approved activities.
Think that‚Äôs hyperbole? Travel around the world for six months to a year, then come back to the United States and tell me what you think.
Little Information Bubbles Merge Into Big Information Bubbles We become what we are repeatedly exposed to, which is why a war is on for your mind
Once we have you believing a certain way or questioning your established beliefs, the key comes when it is time to steer public perception one way or the other. This is where the ‚Äúrubber meets the road‚Äù in the realm of managing the populace like so many sheeple.
BUT when a Big One comes along, like the 2016 national election in the US, the separate tunes come together and ring as one. Then the overriding need to extend Globalism‚Äôs goals (in the person of Hillary Clinton) blot out every other priority. Then the major media twist whatever they need to twist. Then it‚Äôs the same bubble for everyone.
Soon, just like the mainstream media on television and in print, everything you see online will be directed at making you think, behave and vote a certain way. The micromanagement and control of information just hasn‚Äôt become that sophisticated ‚Äì yet.
Obama already hinted that only ‚Äúofficial‚Äù information should be linked up by the corporate interests of Facebook, Google, etc. Look for Hillary to implement that idea with an iron fist if she is whisked into the Oval Office . An Internet security ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù will likely be engineered in the near future in which‚Äîyou guessed it‚ÄîBig Daddy Government needs to step in and take control of the web. From there on out we will be back to corporate-government propaganda instead of the Libertarian‚Äôs dream the current iteration of the Internet is.
So, the awakening we have seen from the brainwashing of the corporate media will be a temporary one if the elite have anything to do with it. The groundwork of this new, Socialist system of micromanaging information is already being laid. You already see it every time you do a search.
Someday soon the only information we‚Äôll be able to find online will be from sources the corporate-government complex approves of. Of course, there will be renegades and rebels like us who resist, but most of the braindead sheeple out there will go along to get along just as has been happening since time immemorial.
Our options will be to get off the grid or to move to a new Internet. Neither move will be peacefully tolerated by the powers that be.

Are the observations of cynicism realistic, brave observations on human nature, freed from sentimentality, or are they only the somber commentary offered by one who is a loser at the game of life, taking solace in his weakness and failure? There are compelling arguments either way. What is not disputed, however, is that Fran√ßois de La Rouchefoucauld was one of the most brilliantly cynical epigrammers who ever lived.
It probably did not help that he came from a long line of noblemen, for nothing so enfeebles the soul as much as inherited wealth and titles. He was born in 1613 and inherited the title of duke on the death of his father in 1650. Receiving the usual education of his class, he dabbled in military matters in his teens. Various itinerant love affairs followed with well-placed women, but some of these ended badly; we find him imprisoned in Bastille for a week in 1636 for political intrigue.
Although married, he continued to pursue other women, as was the custom of the time and his station. Marriages in those days were business affairs to be ignored at each party‚Äôs pleasure or necessity; one such dalliance resulted in an illegitimate child, but the woman eventually rejected him for a more appealing competitor. In 1652 he found himself mixed up with a quasi-revolt called the Fronde, an adventure that left him with impaired sight when he was struck with a musket ball in the head. Health problems also intervened to add to his misery in the form of gout and melancholy.
In late seventeenth century France, the Paris salons were centers of debate, discussion, and the flowering of controversial ideas. By now La Rochefoucauld had acquired an acrid talent for stinging prose, and he knew how to use it. His failures in love and war had primed his spirit for a cynical view of life, and this predilection meshed well with the taste of the salons for savage wit. Nothing is so shallow as sophistication.
From his frequent visits to the salon of Mme. de Sable in Paris, he had begun to piece together a body of epigrams that represented his worldview. One of his peers had more commercial goals in mind, for a bootleg collection of 189 of his sayings was first published without his permission (and with no attribution) in 1663. Two years later he finally put out a proper edition; this contained 317 maxims. The volume was titled Sentences et maximes morales , but this is usually shortened to Maxims. 
There is a philosophy here. It centers around the idea that all men are self-seeking egoists to a fault; any ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù a man displays is only a smokescreen concealing his self-love: ‚ÄúOur virtues are only vices in disguise.‚Äù Human vanity takes precedence over nearly all else: ‚ÄúVirtues are lost in self-interest, as rivers are in the sea.‚Äù Even the nobler emotions like love and altruism, according to La Rochefoucauld, are only a ‚Äúkind of traffic in which self-love ever proposes to be the gainer.‚Äù He took a dim view of women, finding them fit only for love (for men such as himself, of course) and procreation. One of his crueler maxims was ‚Äúfew women‚Äôs worth lasts longer than their beauty.‚Äù
But life‚Äôs realities eventually caught up with him, softening his rougher edges. His wife, who had cared for him in his infirmities for eighteen years, died in 1670; his mother‚Äôs death followed two years later. Two of his sons would eventually die of injuries received in France‚Äôs ruinous wars of the period.
This gloomy picture was brightened by the entry into his life of the Mme. de La Fayette, who was twenty years his junior. She invited him to stay with her in Paris, and he was carried there with difficulty. She seems to have viewed him as a reform project; she would later say that ‚ÄúHe gave me understanding, but I reformed his heart.‚Äù Perhaps his fame made him an interesting captive. The union worked, and seemed to alleviate his dark picture of humanity; and when his final hours came, he asked for, and received, the last rites of the Church in 1680.
A fair assessment of La Rochefoucauld must take into account his undeniable wit, his probing sensitivity, and his ability to strip away the pretenses behind many human actions. Yet all in all, his maxims are meager in result. Many of them are superficial and shallow, the product of a personality still nursing the wounds of an early disillusionment. We weary of his aphorisms after two or three pages, and hesitate to reopen his book later.
Worse still, he was wrong to say that virtue and altruism are shams. Nothing is more vital to life, and we can see them around us every day, if only we know where to look, and as long as our senses are not blinded by fear. Timor animi auribus officit , as Sallust says: fear blocks out the ears.
Any bitter weakling can be a cynic, but it takes depth of character to accept the world‚Äôs‚Äîand man‚Äôs‚Äîfaults and foibles, and to balance those against man‚Äôs unquestioned capacity for greatness of soul. Broader life experiences might have corrected La Rochefoucauld‚Äôs errors, but he preferred to remain in a state of arrested development while receiving the applause and notoriety of Paris society. His maxims can bring smiles to our faces, as it is easy to find amusement in the flaws of others; yet we forget that his barbs were directed at us as well.
Montaigne was far wiser, for he took a balanced view of life, accepting the world‚Äôs absurdities and joys with the equanimity and calm resolution of a Greek or Roman sage. He was also a better man. La Rochefoucauld was intelligent without being wise, and never found the confidence in himself to submit his ego to the consolatory power of a higher philosophical authority in any form. Cynicism, in the end, strips a man of his most important protective armor, and leaves him naked to face the cruelties of life. No cynic ever died a happy man.

The latest batch of the Podesta emails shared by Wikileaks add a darker dimension (if it was even possible) to the sordid culture of corruption, lies and depravity that surrounds Hillary Clinton, explaining why the FBI has been calling her for quite some time now, the ‚ÄúAntichrist personified‚Äù . 
It is a possibility that Hellary‚Äôs clique attends and organizes Satanic rituals, involving mock-up scenes of cannibalism and sexual abuse involving children. 
One of the emails directed at Tony Podesta (John Podesta‚Äôs brother) contains the following sentence: 
‚ÄúI am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. 
Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining?‚Äù 
This really does not sounds like much until you discover the author of this invitation. She, who walks in the footsteps of the Beast 
This is the woman who sent the email, Marina Abramovic. Dressed in red and holding the skinned head of a dead goat, a clear reference to the occult character Baphomet 
There is proof that the Clinton Foundation directly transferred Abramovic ten thousand dollars in at least one instance for her ‚Äúservices.‚Äù Abramovic carving a pentagram in the flesh of her stomach with a blade to show her artistic side 
A self-proclaimed artist, Abramovic hails from Serbia and regularly organizes ‚Äúperformances‚Äù and events using what she calls ‚ÄúSpirit Cooking‚Äù. 
This ‚Äúspirit cooking‚Äù includes mixing semen, breast milk, urine or fresh blood before consuming it or splattering it over various things such as life-sized representations of young children, like shown below: 
This performance included spelling with the body fluids, the following stanza: 
With a sharp 
knife cut deeply into the 
middle finger of your 
left hand 
eat the pain. 
Other examples of her ‚Äúart‚Äù (nowadays any revolting expression of bad taste if sporting the correct pair of problem glasses) include public dinners, where politicians, Hollywood stars, singers and decision makers gather to eat cakes that depict a naked human corpse or feast on the fake (I hope by all that is sacred) blood contained in a coffin where swims another human body. Celebrities that use demonic symbols in their persona such as Lady Gaga rush to participate to Abramovic‚Äôs events Another heavy user of the occult symbols, Jay-Z, is a big fan of Marina 
These codes are all directly copied from rituals such as black masses or Sabat night reunions and popularized by figures such as Aleister Crowley from whom Abramovic draws direct inspiration. 
It is part of this growing phenomenon where the elites and celebrities close to power get caught, intentionally or not, showing symbols celebrating the ancient Babylonian rites or the worship of the Devil. On November the 4th, Clinton chose Jay-Z in a last bid to draw crowds to her empty rallies. Coincidence? Innocent children involved in that mess 
There is hard evidence that Bill Clinton traveled at least 26 times (sometimes without his bodyguards, it is all in the pilot logs) to billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs Island on board his plane, dubbed the ‚ÄúLolita Express,‚Äù as it is in this plane that the guests could allegedly have sex with minors. 
With this in mind, it is disturbing to notice that other Podesta emails refer to children as being the ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù at pool parties almost entirely attended by middle-aged men involved in politics. Other emails involve strange references to food such as ‚Äúpizza‚Äù, ‚Äúcheese‚Äù, $65,000 worth of ‚Äúhot dogs‚Äù for a party that attendees ‚Äúdream of‚Äù and ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù that many sources suggest are code words for orgies involving minors and extremely young children. You can read more about it here . The Whole Clinton Bag of Crooks reeks of unnatural sexual behaviour and reproachable acts and we will certainly know much more in the days to come, as Hillary Clinton is still under FBI investigation as we speak. This follows the scandal surrounding Huma Abedin (Clinton‚Äôs right hand and confidant) and her estranged husband, sex offender and champion one-handed texter, Anthony Weiner. It will take some time before they go through Weiner‚Äôs 650,000 emails and decide of a course of action regarding these dark revelations and other atrocities of the Clinton crime family.

These heavy accusations of Satanism remind us of the sexual blackmail practices said to take place among the popular hip-hop and Hollywood communities, as Roosh described in his related article , or other rumours linked to suspicious reunions involving the secret ceremonies of the elite such as the ones of the Bohemian Grove or the Rothschilds‚Äô parties of the 70s. 
If those recent speculations turn out to be true, it could have the effect of a bomb and mean a revolution. 
Observe the symbols of cannibalism, eerily similar in the three following pictures. Those are respectively: a scene of the Rothschild‚Äôs ‚Äúsurrealistic bal,‚Äù a painting hanging in John Podesta‚Äôs office and one of Abramovic‚Äôs dinners:

Brown;2016-11-08T22:01:29.413+02:00;If You Dress Like An Attention Whore At Work, Expect To Be Treated Like One;"A favorite trope of feminists and women claiming workplace discrimination is that female staff are the victims of ‚Äúsexism‚Äù due to judgments about their appearance. But how many times have we all seen girls working in our building or out on their lunch breaks in attire more befitting of a Tinder date, raunchy nightclub, strip joint, or even the gym? Meanwhile, men must keep their fashion within a very narrow range of acceptability, otherwise they risk failing to get that fancy new job or could lose their current one.
Furthermore, guys learn to deal with the fact that the world does judge you based on your appearance. Many women have zero idea about this concept, only accepting the judgments they agree with or those ones that further their interests and career. For those opinions they don‚Äôt like, they can always conveniently claim the person giving them is sexist or misogynist, or, just as amorphously, ‚Äúobjectifying‚Äù a woman. This is classic attention-seeking.
Attention-whore Jayde Phoenix.
The epitome of this growing female narcissism is a British woman by the name of Jayde Phoenix . Touting herself as a ‚ÄúIT security expert‚Äù (despite her academic and job credentials being a fraction of what it means to be highly qualified or plain non-existent), she suggested a ‚Äúguess the number of USBs in a jar‚Äù competition to promote her company. With her breasts nearly spilling out of a see-through top, she looked at the camera with a lustful gaze, what many on the Roosh V Forum would call ‚Äúa thousand cock stare.‚Äù Her clothes (and demeanor) better suited a street hooker than a ‚Äúprofessional.‚Äù
As we should have expected in our troubled times, the many critics of Phoenix‚Äôs contrived appearance were labeled as ‚Äúsexists,‚Äù ‚Äúbullies,‚Äù and ‚Äúmisogynists.‚Äù She herself tried to excoriate her detractors, emphasizing how ‚Äúgood‚Äù she was at her job and the professional standards she supposedly meets every day. But there are a few questions both the original photo exercise and her subsequent justifications failed to answer, namely:
If she‚Äôs so good at her job, why did she need to use a see-through bra in the picture? Why doesn‚Äôt she wear a top size that comfortably contains her breasts, rather than flaunting them? Why is she and not someone else in the photo? Though the attention-seeking of Jayde and her employer first flared up several months ago, the dilemma of girls like her is an ongoing one.
Try getting employed in an office as a man with this sort of attire Baggy pants with your underwear showing 
The male office worker could be wearing black pants and not jeans, like in the photo, and sporting a typical business shirt. That doesn‚Äôt matter. No white collar company worth a dime is going to hire a man whose boxers or briefs are showing down to his ass. Compare this to the parade of female office workers who go beyond showing their arms and the hint of a bra strap to exhibiting half the surface area of their breasts. In addition, if you haven‚Äôt already noticed, the very short crop top is now a staple garment within American office (un)culture. It is not unusual to see a large part of a woman‚Äôs bare stomach and back, including over-the-top tattoos.
Hawaiian shirts and board shorts 
Some workplaces, most notably those trying to appear ‚Äúhip,‚Äù have drastically relaxed the need for business attire. But these employers are definitely in the minority. A man with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts, board shirts or other beach clothing will find his career options drastically limited. As they should be! The way in which you relate to your friends or fellow tourists on a holiday is almost always far different from how you should deal with clients, investors, stakeholders and the like in your profession. Men save their best (or worst) Hawaiian shirt for office charity fundraising days, company summer parties and related functions, not an average day.
Leather, lycra or ridiculously tight clothing in general 
Inasmuch as tight clothing on men doesn‚Äôt tickle your or my fancy, it‚Äôs how ironic how an obese woman can wear garments twice or thrice as close-fitting in the workplace than a fit male. And, male office workers of the world, don‚Äôt even consider wearing leather pants during your next boardroom presentation. The occasional gay man or metrosexual might escape sanction for some outlandish or garish outfit, but most industries, if they value their reputation with clients, will prohibit you from donning clothing that looks like it came from the wardrobe of Lance Armstrong or someone from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .
Excuses for female attention-seeking are out of control It seems that ‚ÄúLady‚Äù Victoria Hervey and Jayde Phoenix read the same book.
There is little doubt that Jayde Phoenix‚Äôs employer expected a backlash against her. In this sense, it was a very good marketing and advertising ploy (for those prospective clients who do not care about actual professionalism, of which there are many). As for Phoenix and other women like her, this situation is win-win. At the very least, she and those of her ilk can continue their day-to-day objectification of themselves, generating desperately craved male attention in particular. Even for girls who do not receive the public‚Äôs spotlight, any roadblock or mishap in their career can later be blamed on ‚Äúmisogyny‚Äù after judgments about their appearance.
At best, as happened in Phoenix‚Äôs situation, she gets nation-wide and even global coverage. For narcissistic girls who take zero responsibility for how others may negatively perceive them, this is the coup of a lifetime. Yet as they age (and Jayde Phoenix looks far older than her early 20s), expect their antics to become more straw-clutching. And while these girls engage in sexual self-advancement and wage war over imaginary discriminations, the vast majority of male employees have no scapegoat they can use to rationalize their failures and virtually no means of combating institutionalized prejudice against their so-called ‚Äúprivilege.‚Äù
By the way, is Jayde Phoenix‚Äôs Arabic necklace indicative of some ‚Äúwork‚Äù she may have done in Dubai?

Donald Trump was elected America‚Äôs 45th president Tuesday, an astonishing victory for a celebrity businessman and political novice who capitalized on voters‚Äô economic anxieties, took advantage of racial tensions and overcame a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the White House.
His triumph over Hillary Clinton will end eight years of Democratic dominance of the White House and threatens to undo major achievements of President Barack Obama. He‚Äôs pledged to act quickly to repeal Obama‚Äôs landmark health care law, revoke the nuclear agreement with Iran and rewrite important trade deals with other countries, particularly Mexico and Canada.
The Republican blasted through Democrats‚Äô longstanding firewall, carrying Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that hadn‚Äôt voted for a GOP presidential candidate since the 1980s. He needed to win nearly all of the competitive battleground states, and he did just that, claiming Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and others.
Global stock markets and U.S. stock futures plunged deeply, reflecting investor alarm over what a Trump presidency might mean for the economy and trade.
A New York real estate developer who lives in a sparking Manhattan high-rise, Trump forged a striking connection with white, working class Americans who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of the problems plaguing many Americans and taped into fears of terrorism emanating at home and abroad.
Trump will take office with Congress expected to be fully under Republican control. GOP Senate candidates fended off Democratic challengers in key states and appeared poised to maintain the majority. Republicans also maintained their grip on the House.
Senate control means Trump will have great leeway in appointing Supreme Court justices, which could mean a major change to the right that would last for decades.
Trump upended years of political convention on his way to the White House, leveling harshly personal insults on his rivals, deeming Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers, and vowing to temporarily suspend Muslim immigration to the U.S. He never released his tax returns, breaking with decades of campaign tradition, and eschewed the kind of robust data and field efforts that helped Obama win two terms in the White House, relying instead on his large, free-wheeling rallies to energize supporters. His campaign was frequently in chaos, and he cycled through three campaign managers this year.
His final campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, touted the team‚Äôs accomplishments as the final results rolled in, writing on Twitter that ‚Äúrally crowds matter‚Äù and ‚Äúwe expanded the map.‚Äù
The mood at Clinton‚Äôs party grew bleak as the night wore out, with some supporters leaving, others crying and hugging each other. Top campaign aides stopped returning calls and texts, as Clinton and her family hunkered down in a luxury hotel watching the returns.
At 2 a.m., Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told the crowd to head home for the night. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still counting votes and every vote should count,‚Äù he said.
Trump will inherit an anxious nation, deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities, race and culture.
Exit polls underscored the fractures: Women nationwide supported Clinton by a double-digit margin, while men were significantly more likely to back Trump. More than half of white voters backed the Republican, while nearly 9 in 10 blacks and two-thirds of Hispanics voted for the Democrat.
Doug Ratliff, a 67-year-old businessman from Richlands, Virginia, said Trump‚Äôs election would be one of the happiest days of his life.
‚ÄúThis county has had no hope,‚Äù said Ratliff, who owns strip malls in the area badly beaten by the collapse of the coal industry. ‚ÄúYou have no idea what it would mean for the people if Trump won. They‚Äôll have hope again. Things will change. I know he‚Äôs not going to be perfect. But he‚Äôs got a heart. And he gives people hope.‚Äù
Trump has pledged to usher in a series of sweeping changes to U.S. domestic and foreign policy: repealing Obama‚Äôs signature health care law, though he has been vague on what he could replace it with; building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border; and suspending immigration from country‚Äôs with terrorism ties. He‚Äôs also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and spoken of building a better relationship with Moscow, worrying some in his own party who fear he‚Äôll go easy on Putin‚Äôs provocations.
The Republican Party‚Äôs tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush declined to back Trump, instead selecting ‚Äúnone of the above‚Äù when they voted for president, according to spokesman Freddy Ford.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, a reluctant Trump supporter, called the businessman earlier in the evening to congratulate him, according to a Ryan spokeswoman.

Brown;2016-11-09T14:01:27.204+02:00;Wall Street, Hollywood, The Media And SJWs Fail To Stop Donald Trump From Becoming America‚Äôs 45th President;"Gentlemen, Donald J. Trump is the new President-elect of the United States. Though a a few results may still be unclear, Trump has captured the perennial large battleground states of Ohio, Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina, plus Georgia. And, in a change not seen in more than a generation, he has seized Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Pennsylvania and Michigan have not voted for a Republican Presidential candidate since 1988 and Wisconsin since way back in 1984. It appears also that states the Democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them, such as Minnesota, Maine and Virginia, have stayed blue with only wafer-thin or very disappointing margins. The 2nd Congressional district of Maine, a state which divides its electoral votes along with Nebraska, has been called for the Republicans for the first time in nearly 30 years. The last time any Maine district voted for a GOP Presidential candidate was 1988, when George H. W. Bush seized all four electoral votes there.
Importantly, too, avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for Trump. For example, counts so far show that some 40% of voters in Connecticut and Rhode Island, states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally, have opted for the ‚Äúracist,‚Äù ‚Äúsexist,‚Äù and ‚Äúhomophobic‚Äù Republican candidate. Their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map, but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm, plenty of people are happy to support Trump. This is despite them facing fierce rebukes and, often enough, violence if they make their views public.
The ‚Äúclown‚Äù candidate has beaten 16 more ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù Republican challengers and now Hillary Clinton, the most elite-backed candidate in the world‚Äôs political history.
As tonight‚Äôs results have shown, plenty of Trump voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet. Media airtime for pro-Trump views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks. Mainstream ‚Äújournalists‚Äù such as Glenn Thrush , Wolf Blitzer , Jake Tapper , Jessica Valenti , and Brent Budowsky have been caught collaborating with both the DNC and Clinton campaign (if you believe that these two groups are actually separate). This only increases the esteem in which the emphatic, resounding Trump victory needs to be held.
And let‚Äôs not forget the Senate and House races! After months of spineless GOP cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from Trump, The Donald has still carried them to victory in both Houses of Congress . The White House, Senate and House of Representatives are all in Republican hands until at least the 2018 House midterms. Can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and SJWs yet?
Every powerful vested interest not only supported Hillary, but did everything they could to ruin Trump Yes, it‚Äôs happening.
Did you see the last major Hillary Clinton rallies? Celebrities-cum-political hacktivists, chief among them Lady Gaga, Beyonc√©, Jay Z, Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and Katy Perry, all fell into Clinton‚Äôs corner well before their final appearances for her, excoriating anyone who had the gall to support Donald Trump. Even long-term Republicans who betrayed Trump, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, were attacked by celebrity SJWs such as Robert DeNiro after they joined the ‚ÄúNever Trump‚Äù ranks, as if they were dangerous saboteurs. The celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months. Hollywood, that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers, silver screen actors, and comedians, has become little more than an overpaid trade union for Hillary Clinton.
Likewise, every major American company that has come out for a candidate has come out for Hillary. Plenty of ‚Äúneutral‚Äù corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the Clinton campaign behind the scenes as well. Prominent billionaires like George Soros and Warren Buffett have done all they could to drag Hillary‚Äôs stumbling half-corpse, both literally and figuratively, across the line. Whilst Trump has been supported by a number of ten-figure businessmen, these men are regularly attacked in the media. They include the scapegoated but brave Peter Thiel and Carl Icahn.
And then there‚Äôs the mainstream media. Countless studies have indicated that about 85-90% of all journalists are liberal. This over-representation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women, particularly prominent mastheads such as The New York Times , Washington Post , and Huffington Post , plus Democratic TV surrogates like CNN and NBC. The 2016 campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias, one that plagued the two George W. Bush Administrations but raged even more ferociously against Donald Trump over the last 18 months.
All of these media elites have lambasted Trump for over a year, at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting Hillary, Podesta and DNC emails. Everything newsworthy on this front, from the overwhelming presence of Clinton Foundation donors in Hillary‚Äôs Secretary of State diary book to more recent revelations about John Podesta‚Äôs involvement with Satanic rituals, has been brushed off the balcony by the Wolf Blitzers and Chuck Todds of the American mainstream media. Yet Trump has triumphed nonetheless!
The new administration must crush the criminal Democratic elites and Clinton Foundation with the rule of law Will Hillary now find herself stumbling into jail?
Inasmuch as the Clinton campaign, the SJWs, and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this year‚Äôs election, they retain very well-oiled and effective means for trying to undermine President Trump once he takes office. Trump‚Äôs first priority as Commander-in-Chief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the Clinton Foundation. He also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities, as uncovered by Wikileaks, perpetrated from within the DNC and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign.
The Department of Justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery, most notably when Attorney-General Loretta Lynch had a private meeting with Bill Clinton during the most crucial time of the FBI investigation into Hillary‚Äôs emails. Additionally, elements of the State Department illegally informed Hillary about new developments in that same case. Enough is enough. It‚Äôs time to drain the swamp.
Election night produced another curve-ball: after weeks of calling Donald Trump a ‚Äúsore loser‚Äù for him not saying if he would respect the final result, Hillary Clinton refused to speak to her supporters and the American people. It would seem that she only telephoned Trump privately. So who‚Äôs the sore loser now?
Last night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral sea-change in American‚Äîand perhaps global‚Äîhistory. We cannot lose sight of the work to be done, but for the next 24 hours we can bask in this unprecedented victory against all odds.
Hail to the Chief, Donald J. Trump.

Though we may not have to worry about this for a few years after 2nd Amendment enthusiast Donald Trump‚Äôs decisive victory last night, let‚Äôs cover our bases and talk about a panic if future Democrats are elected.
What is a panic for ammo and firearms? A panic is when people go and buy items just to have them because they are worried that there will soon be no more, or it will be illegal to buy and sell such items, but maybe not to own them already, as most Americans still believe in the no ex post facto laws part of the Constitution.
Adding to a panic is speculators, who buy from retailers who are roundly shamed if they raise their own prices, only to resell privately at much higher levels. While this is legal, it certainly isn‚Äôt ethical or a decent thing to do, and these folks deserve being shamed and mocked at every opportunity.
Lastly, the gun store‚Äôs or site‚Äôs inventory cannot handle the flex in the buying demand, nor can the manufacturer, and an artificially contrived panic creates a real scarcity that can only be corrected by the panic running out of steam as everyone buys what they consider to be enough and natural undercutting resets the price back to lower levels.
Some prices never return. 22 Long Rifle ammunition has still not totally recovered from the damage old B-rock ‚Äúthe Islamic Shock‚Äù Obama did to it with his multi-year championship of Best Firearms Salesman Ever, and it may be even worse under the Bitch in Chief.
So, what gets grabbed in a panic? What should you get? What should you count on still being available? We‚Äôve got three categories: guns, ammo, and components/accessories.
Guns Anything that‚Äôs big on the liberal hit list is a first target for a ban, so it‚Äôs a first target for a panic. Look for things that are popular with the right, and scary to the left. Also look for things that are modern; no one is going to ban the M1 Garand anytime soon.
Evil features matter more than destructive power. Anyone who knows anything about guns knows that the AK-47 and the AR-15 fire intermediate cartridges that are puny enough to be considered inhumane in several states with which to hunt deer as they lack the power to kill the animal with marginal shots. However, they‚Äôre black and have mean things attached to them, so they‚Äôre on the shit list, while a nice blued with wooden stock scoped bolt action rifle in a magnum cartridge capable of wrecking your world from twice the distance that an AR can pull is safe as it looks ‚Äútraditional.‚Äù
They have to be popular to the left to get noticed; rifles like the FAL and anything based of the G3/HK91 action simply don‚Äôt have enough exposure to get targeted, unless they pull something sweeping like the USC 18 922r rules again. The Mini 30 and the M1A might be safe; maybe.
For pistols, pretty much any semi-automatic of the polymer age is fair game to want banned. Oftentimes, stupid rules like restrictive magazine sizes get pushed. 1911s, Hi Powers, other old domestic semi-autos, and revolvers should be safe. Expect the libtards to go after Glocks and the like.
Shotguns seem to be immune these days as there‚Äôs not a whole lot of difference between a hunting gun and a combat gun other than paint and mag tube length. I think the Saigas are still not being imported, and it‚Äôs about the only box mag fed one out there, but anything else makes a good home defense gun that should also be immune to the ammo panic portion as well.
Ammunition Range (full metal jacket) and defense/hunting (hollow or soft point) cartridges in popular centerfire calibers and 22 Long Rifle will almost literally evaporate from your local store and online, and it‚Äôs probably beginning as I write this.
Oddly enough, only certain rounds will suffer panic buying. For rifles, it‚Äôs limited to .223/5.56, 7.62√ó39, and .308/7.62√ó51. Traditional hunting rounds like 30-30, .243, and .270 do not seem to be impacted. Why doesn‚Äôt 30-06 get bought in a panic? As the old joke goes, men with 30-06‚Äôs don‚Äôt panic, but it really has to do with the feedback cycle I mentioned at the start. If there‚Äôs little demand, it cannot exceed the in-store supply, so the perception of it being gone for good cannot occur.
Everything but the shotgun shell and the howitzer round to the far right will sell fast in a panic.
Panic bought pistol ammo is the big 3: 9mm Luger, 40 S&W, and .45 ACP. .380 will round out the affected semi-automatic rounds, and there usually is a bit of a run on .357 Magnum and .38 Special as well. 10mm, .357 SIG, .45 GAP and other magnums like the .44 do not seem to be affected.
For rimfires, .22 Long Rifle just goes poof, while its Magnum brother and smaller, 17 caliber, cousins do not seem to be as affected. Rimfires are not reloadable, and this contributes to their over-stockpiling.
Components and Accessories Most centerfire ammo is reloadable, and the serious amongst shooters will roll their own for economy, self-reliance, and performance, so the consumable components will also get some panics. Although I‚Äôve held off on reloading articles until I get my press set back up, we can hit up the components that will get panic bought briefly.
Biggest thing is primers, even bigger than the bullets, oddly enough. The primer is the little metal cup that gets smacked by the firing pin and sets off the powder in modern cartridges, and they come in two sizes for pistols, two for rifles, and of varying hardness to satisfy military specifications.
The second is gunpowder itself. Fortunately, there‚Äôs a wide variety of smokeless powder, and everyone tends to have the brands and formulas they prefer, so it takes a little less of a hit than the primers. The third is the bullets, and since there are so many types and manufacturers, they also take a little less of a hit than primers. While you obviously need all three to reload, bear that in mind. Always save your brass, and anyone else‚Äôs you can pick up.
Even though the little ones are easier to use, the higher capacity ones disappear first. Get both.
While it is always a good idea to have spare springs and small parts like firing pins and extractors that are prone to breakage, the number one accessory or part to take a hit in panics is the box magazine, especially ‚Äúhigh capacity‚Äù ones. I don‚Äôt mean the 200 round drum mags, although those do take a dive, nor do I really mean the 100 round coffin mags, but I mean the full capacity full sized pistol mags, like a 15 round mag for a full sized pistol, or a 30 round AR-15 mag. Expect to see P-mags and surplus style aluminum AR mags just vanish. The Gabby Giffords Special, the extended Glock 17 30 round mag, is also a contender for vanishing fast in a panic.
Holsters, slings, cleaning accessories, optics, and ammo cans seem to be immune from panics.
What to do? If you already own a carbine and/or a semi-auto pistol, make sure you have enough ammo, magazines, and spare parts. It‚Äôs a lot better to have one gun with multiple mags and a lot of ammo than many guns with the one or two mags with which they came from the factory and a couple boxes of ammo.
I try to have at least six mags for my semi-auto pistols, and at least ten mags for my semi-auto rifles. Get some rifle mags of different sizes, the 30 and 40 AR mags are fun for shooting standing up, but they get in the way of prone firing and the 10 and 20 rounders are preferable.
Your ultimate ammo goal, I maintain, should be a thousand practice rounds and 500 defense rounds for each gun you have, but, in a pre-panic or panic situation, just get what you can at a normal price; some is better than none. If you‚Äôre into reloading, you know what to get already.
If you don‚Äôt own anything, and want to soon, refer to some pistol articles , a rifle article, a shotgun article, and a buying guide here. Consider buying some stripped AR lowers to build on a rainy day later on.
Build an AR and meet girls at the range?
Conclusion No matter who got elected, I think this country is in for rough times. It‚Äôs always better to have firearms and not need them, then not have them and need them. Store yours safely, but accessible and ready in times of need.

The tears of liberals are flowing freely, as Donald Trump has recently been announced president. All of the hard work that we‚Äôve committed ourselves to over the past year has finally come to a close. It‚Äôs truly an event of the ages: a hard working, American businessman beat out the globalist titans and Satanic elite.
In the spirit of this great victory, I believe that we‚Äôre all entitled to some enjoyment. This article will be solely dedicated to bathing in liberal tears; and, mark my words, it will be glorious.

Hillary HQ: Morale Obliterated Sorry guys, there‚Äôs no brakes on the #TrumpTrain
As poll results came in, moving Trump from a measly 2% chance to a whopping 95% chance of seizing the presidency, libtards began crying all across the nation. Turns out that America does not, in fact, want their Lord and Savior Hillary Rodham Christ, to be president of the free world.
Note the sour expression of the woman on the far right.
Unfortunately for you guys, Trump has won the presidency. Sorry illegals‚Äîyou‚Äôre out. SJWism is coming to an end, the mainstream media is dying off, and we‚Äôre going to make America great again.

Andr√© is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 11, 2016 Culture 
The existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever. Many are those who contend for public attention, credibility, and money as a reward for their wits, not to mention the very status of intellectual. Yet the existence of such people is far from self-evident. For centuries, traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals, and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years. 
So, as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the Empire of Nothing‚Äîa necessary step if we want a lasting victory‚Äîan important question must be confronted: do we need at all what has been called ‚Äúintellectuals‚Äù during last centuries? And if we do not, what should we have instead? The origin of modern intellectuals 
At the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis. Before it, Western Europe was united by the same Christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economy‚Äîsubordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer. 
When modernity reared its philosophical head through Ren√© Descartes, a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century, the Old Continent was in a much more problematic state: Christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core. We have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence. But, in fact, thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression. 
The Irish bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753) criticized how the practice of philosophy had become, on his age, synonymous with getting embroiled into ‚Äúthousand scruples‚Ä¶ prejudices and errors of sense,‚Äù a situation he attributed to ‚Äúthe wrong use we make of our faculties.‚Äù Likewise, the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-1776) scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the ‚Äúsystems‚Äù of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene, that is, a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything: 
There is nothing which is not the subject of debate, and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions. The most trivial question escapes not our controversy, and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision. Disputes are multiplied, as if everything was uncertain; and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth, as if everything was certain. Amidst all this bustle it is not reason, which carries the prize, but eloquence‚Ä¶ From hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds. 
The first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis. Descartes, Berkeley, Hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies. But soon the very controversy became an institution. A whole market of ideas was growing, in which more and more lettr√©s started to see an opportunity to make a name, thus earning fame, social standing and sometimes money. Hume could not help himself: soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others‚Äô ‚Äúsystems‚Äù while promoting their own, he was doing the same. 
Such was the so-called Enlightenment: the further undermining of any spiritual, philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety. They would be experts at flattering the powerful, mocking the Catholic church, fiddle fashionable themes and ‚Äúwitty‚Äù prose, and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù The very expression ‚ÄúEnlightenment‚Äù stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity. The intellectuals‚Äô bread and butter 
It can be noted that, from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century, generations of scientists have sprang up. Some of these characters were mathematicians, engineers, doctors, or dedicated observers of nature, and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter . But make no mistake: even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research, thus following a headlong rush dynamic. At its side, the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them. 
The momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern West. Where God ceased to speak, the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress. It doesn‚Äôt matter if problems are genuine or artificial. Intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron. 
Two typical intellectual characters are Voltaire and √âmile Zola. Both were gifted writers, both were charming and witty, both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times, and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves. (Not so incidentally, both were French and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism.) 
Voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were Protestants inside a Catholic country. The infamous affaire Calas , from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son, was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society, stirring the public opinion, pressuring magistrates, until the father‚Äîwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigation‚Äîwas rehabilitated. Two centuries and a half later, young Frenchmen are still taught Voltaire was a champion of truth, justice, and reason, whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence. 
Zola, more than a century later, did the same. A Jewish-French captain, Alfred Dreyfus , was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to Prussia. Years later, some new evidence seemed to indicate that Dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents: at this very moment, Zola published an incendiary article, J‚Äôaccuse , where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire . Eventually, Dreyfus was rehabilitated‚Äîand the army, the patriots and the Catholics were shamed through a never-ending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story. 
Voltaire and Zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind. We are taught about a situation of injustice, where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions. Fortunately, a heroic talking head rises, miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such, the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as ‚Äúoppressors,‚Äù and the poor victim‚Äôs rehabilitation is also the victory of reason, justice, and progress. 
Thus, the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions. Teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion‚Ä¶ provided they follow a mysterious sense of history. There have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics, and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside. Who‚Äôs gonna pay? 
Even if you are gifted with words and language, being a talking head does not pay much. Would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion, no matter how elaborate, on anything? The problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots: Voltaire was close from wealthy Protestants bankers, one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in Geneva, and Zola was a Rotschild prot√©g√© . Both of them contributed to tarnish Catholicism and most of their own people. In other words, they served interests that could pay them‚Äîthey were sellouts. 
Today, some bloggers happen to earn money as independents, especially when they found themselves a niche. Yet independence is scarce. Way too many people would like to live from their wits, and, even more, obtain recognition as intellectuals. More than often, intellectual types turn into teachers, journalists, or even marketers‚Äîthus depending upon an institution that pays them. 
In North America, the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized , whether in the academic or in the media. You won‚Äôt easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural Marxism. And in case you wouldn‚Äôt be self-hating enough, they are already replacing you with ‚Äúminority‚Äù individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily. 
Old Marxism was well-aligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class, not as individuals. It handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù Keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated State where model-obsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth. Intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status, money, and moral recognition. 
But the whole Marxist vocabulary of ‚Äúprogress‚Äù and ‚Äúemancipation‚Äù dissimulated what seems glaring today. Namely, that intellectuals were recognized and paid, not because they were enlightened or bright, but because they were an efficient tool of destruction. 
The conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types. The average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite. Such a lack pushed a number of high IQs to the arms of the left, who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism, anti-whiteness, anti-masculinity, pathological altruism, transgender madness, ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù repression and so on. Intellectuals were never paid to say the truth: they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function. 
If we happen to beat cultural Marxism, what shall we do with intellectual types? If we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies, we have to think about what we will replace the bobo -leftist establishment. The intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution. A truly traditional society would likely have initiates, something akin to high priests and knights, in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers. How exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question. Conclusion 
The French essayist Alain Soral once famously said, ‚Äúa journalist is either a whore or without a job.‚Äù This is even truer for most intellectuals, sold as they are to a destructive left or (more seldomly) to the inefficient right. 
Culture is overrated. What the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix, full of lies, taboos, and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit. No wonder why the shrewd Robert Greene advised to be an ‚Äúintense realist‚Äù: one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream ‚Äúculture.‚Äù 
The previous generations could join the cultural Marxist establishment and pretend their destructive, ego-laden works were progress. To our generation, this is impossible. Either we stand up for our very existence, even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies, or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death. Before we take the power back, a shared awareness must be stimulated, and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the well-funded anti-white, anti-masculine establishment types, whom we must beat on their own field once and for all. Bonus: 6 quotes about the intellectuels 
Some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning. [Modern philosophy] features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints. These issues only exist because they are poorly framed. They have no fundamental reason to exist. In many cases, defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear, plain and simple, if [modern] philosophy did not strive to maintain them, because it makes a living out of ambiguity. ‚Äî Ren√© Gu√©non, Introduction to the study of the Hindu doctrines , chap.8. Ren√© Gu√©non (young) 
Philosophers care much more about putting forth problems, no matter how artificial and illusory, than about solving them‚Ä¶ They also strive to link their name to a ‚Äòsystem,‚Äô that is, to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work. Hence the desire to be original at any price, even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality. A philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others. ‚ÄîRen√© Gu√©non, The Crisis of the Modern World , chap.5. Ren√© Gu√©non (older) 
The most evident feature of [modern] critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity. Its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant, in appearing original‚Ä¶ From the point of view of those who embody this ‚Äòintellectuality,‚Äô the catchy line, the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others, have a much greater value than truth. Ideas, when they use them, are nothing but a pretext. What matters is to look intelligent‚Äîjust as, to the mainstream politician, the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career. The ‚Äòvanity fair,‚Äô the most deleterious subjectivism, often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism, are essential components of this phenomenon‚Ä¶ The ‚Äòcritique‚Äô is a scourge of modern culture, an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture‚Ä¶ In normal, traditional civilizations, one could find creators, artists, and those who would judge the works without intermediaries: the sovereigns, the patrons, and the people. Our times have witnessed the appearance, between the public and the creators, that cultural pimp, that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a ‚Äòcritique.‚Äô ‚Äî Julius Evola, The Bow and the Club Baron Giulio Cesare Evola 
Show me more venal, more insensitive, more corrupt minds than those of the literate caste! How many of them do you know whose virtue would still be uncorrupted? Who, but them, for over thirty years, kept flooding us with a loosened morale, a disdain for work, a disgust of duty, a disrespect for family, who but the literary? Who dipped into secret funds more shamelessly than they did? Who seduced women, softened the young, excited the nation to more debauchery than they did? Who did abandon cowardly the princes after begging for their favours‚Ä¶? So-called men of letters, always! They run like harlots between the legitimate government and usurpers, between monarchy and republic, between politics and socialism, between atheism and religion. Everything is good to them as long as they can make a profit and be fashionable out of it. ‚Äî Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (quoted by the following one) Pierre-Joseph Proudon 
Compare, for example, seventeenth century writers with those of the eighteenth. What a difference in tone and gait! The former, under a veneer of servility, have the most noble and proud stance‚Ä¶ They do not pretend to reign. They merely stand at their place, recognize the place of a superior power beyond, give themselves completely to their writing task, dismiss the temptation of advertising and demonstrate their professional dedication. On the other hand, look at the Voltaire, Diderot and the like: they open well the era of intellectuals, writing stooges as they are, courtiers of princes they flatter and despise at the same time‚Äîsomething they are forced to do as they want to usurp their power‚Ä¶ Their courtier nature reveals in everything they do‚Ä¶ The whole eighteenth century, both spiritual and plain on a scoundrel background, is libertine, and already pornographic: such is the start of literary mercantilism; people of letters make money out of their writings, pretend to financial independence, and they write garbage to flatter the opinion of their public. ‚Äî √âdouard Berth, Les m√©faits des intellectuels (‚Äúthe misdeeds of the intellectuals‚Äù), Introduction √âdouard Berth (disciple of Proudhon) 
I have had the same experience with journalists citing each other about my books without the smallest effort to go to my writings‚Äîmy experience is that most journalists, professional academics, and other in similar phony professions don‚Äôt read original sources, but each other, largely because they need to figure out the consensus before making a pronouncement. ‚Äî Nassim Taleb, Antifragile , chap.23.";english;2016-11-11T15:03:46.838+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;Why So-Called Intellectuals Do More Harm Than Good To Society;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

There have been few true upsets in our history: Caesar crossing the Rubicon, Wellington‚Äôs victories at Assaye and Waterloo, and Washington‚Äôs victory at Yorktown over the most professional army in the world. It is often said that when General Charles O‚ÄôHara (who had the dubious distinction of surrendering to both George Washington and Napoleon Bonaparte) surrendered Cornwallis‚Äôs sword, the band played ‚ÄúThe World Turned Upside Down.‚Äù 
Today, the establishment and the intellectuals cannot help but share a similar sentiment as Cornwallis or O‚ÄôHara did at Yorktown. And I fully admit: In spite of my vote for Trump, I fully expected him to lose. The polls, his 60% negative approval rating, and the sheer forces of the media, the FBI and even some Republicans were arrayed against him. My skepticism of Trump was not his ideas, but his chances of winning the election. Myself, and other conservative intellectual skeptics who voted for him, were wrong. 
I am one of the intellectuals who expected a Trump defeat. I‚Äôve been studying politics, history and economics for years, reading countless books on the matter from The Prince to Freakonomics to The Wealth of Nations. 
And I was wrong. It was a Canadian housewife and an Iranian pickup artist who called it correctly for Trump. Trump beat the odds, he beat the intellectuals, and made the establishment ‚Äúbabies in the hands of a giant‚Äù as was said after Napoleon‚Äôs resounding victory at Austerlitz in 1806. 
The left is currently in panic-mode in an attempt to explain how they lost. They are calling Trump supporters racist, sexists, homophobic and even sex offenders! But in the end, it was this same blindness that made them psychologically incapable of defeating Donald Trump. Trump was immune to almost all conventional political weapons. Trump won because of the following 
1. The left seemed far more interested in calling Trump and his supporters racist than saying something of substance. 
2. Outlets such as the New York Times did blatantly stupid crap like try to blame the NRA for the Orlando Shootings, and even tried to call them terrorists. In this, they beat even Trump in outrageousness: they thought the American people were stupid, so they just lied to them and said ‚Äúfuck it, those peasants will believe anything we write.‚Äù 
3. All Trump had to do was call them on their bullshit, and call them liars. And he was 100% right: the MSM has lied to the American people this entire election cycle. Subsequent to every terrorist attack perpetrated by a Muslim, the MSM continued to push the narrative that ‚Äúhome grown right-wing terrorism is the real problem.‚Äù Trump called them on their lies, and the American people, who are tired of being lied to by the MSM, cheered him on, even if he had a few issues with the truth himself. 
4. The Democrats ran the absolute worst candidate possible. Hillary Clinton had negative approval ratings that rivaled Trump‚Äôs own. And she was bland. And she couldn‚Äôt decide if she was a moderate or a firebrand progressive. And she is corrupt, and lied about it, stupidly thinking the American people were too ignorant to understand that putting classified information on a private email server is a recklessly irresponsible thing to do. 
5. Trump knew how to communicate with people. He knew that whites without a college degree were tired of being talked down to by progressives on the left and genuine intellectuals on the right (like myself). I freely admit I am guilty of this: when you study two thousand years of philosophy, economics and rhetoric (Cicero was particularly effective), it is sometimes frustrating when people don‚Äôt approach a situation in terms of axioms and proofs. The working class that built America go by what they feel in their gut, and often times, they are right. 
All in all, the left failed because they failed to understand America. They bought into the idea that ‚ÄúAmericans are stupid‚Ä¶haha!‚Äù Americans are not stupid: they may not be smart, but they sure as hell know when a liberal taking head is lying to them about now the NRA is basically the Taliban in an obviously biased hit piece. Hillary took working class Americans for granted, and she lost. This should stand as a parallel for black Americans whom the Democrats also take for granted. 
I am pleased that Donald Trump is now President-Elect. He wasn‚Äôt just a candidate, he was the anti-candidate. He did everything a politician should not do. He used vulgar language. He talked freely about his ideas. He made no pretense about being polite to those who are destroying America. He turned weaknesses (such as his spotty track record) into strengths that would have ended any other candidate‚Äôs campaign. He was the un-candidate America needed. 
I have high hopes for Trump‚Äôs presidency. In spite of my tepid support, I see Trump as a President who can do a lot of good, and has the potential to do more good than any President of recent memory. 
First, Trump spat in the face of PC culture and won. Just as Scott Walker took on the Unions in Wisconsin and cucked them by winning the recall election by getting more votes than he did in the previous election, Trump defeated the SJW‚Äôs. If Trump can keep this up, we can achieve a major strategic victory in the war against political correctness, and get back to a concept called ‚Äúactually being correct.‚Äù 
Secondly, Trump is an unapologetic nationalist. He loves America, and doesn‚Äôt give a damn if you think Howard Zinn‚Äôs A People‚Äôs History of the United States is a great book. The Department of Cultural Guilt that has infected schools in America teaches children to hate their own country. I look forward to seeing Trump abolish the practice of teaching children that the Founding Fathers were evil racists, the British Empire did nothing good for the world, and that America is the greatest evil the world has ever seen. 
Lastly, Trump is the antithesis of everything the Social Justice Warriors stand for: a successful alpha male who tells people to go fuck themselves and still gets elected. I hope to see a rise in masculinity in America: studies have shown that testosterone levels are down among the American male population. This should rise under Trump, as men embrace their masculinity instead of hiding it for fear of being accused of sexual assault. 
I was a Trump skeptic. I underestimated him. I didn‚Äôt disagree with him on much (perhaps maybe 20% of his platform), but I had little faith he could pull it off. And I was vocal about my concerns regarding his elect-ability. But like the liberals, I was wrong. And a Canadian housewife and a former pickup-artist-turned-conservative-philosopher were 100% right. 
I recall something I told a fellow soldier while on a long, boring convoy operation in Iraq: ‚ÄúWhen a genius says something, others say ‚Äòwow, that is way above my head.‚Äô But when a true genius says something, others say ‚Äòwow, why didn‚Äôt I think of that before?!‚Äù Trump is a true genius: he stated the obvious to the American people and made them believe he wanted to Make America Great Again (and I think he genuinely does). He didn‚Äôt use fancy graphs or focus groups: he spoke the truth, without political correctness. 
And now he is President-Elect.";english;2016-11-12T20:24:08.441+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;What The Trump Skeptics Got Wrong;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Jon enjoys helping others evolve into their best selves on his blog: Masculine Development and recently launched his eBook on 7 Strategies to Develop Your Masculinity. November 12, 2016 Game 
After my previous article , which advocated that men learn game as a form of self-development, I got a good amount of disagreement‚Äîmost of it was not inaccurate. The majority of ROK readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game, simply because Western women are not as attractive as they once were. 
This isn‚Äôt to say that we‚Äôve abandoned learning game as a whole; certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship. But, nonetheless, there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesn‚Äôt believe that game is worth it anymore. 
In this article, I would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game. In retrospect, my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects; I do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game. In fact, it‚Äôs quite the opposite. 
As a veteran myself, I‚Äôm quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game. I‚Äôve been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes, I‚Äôve had drinks thrown on me, I‚Äôve had guys threaten to slit my throat, and more. Despite this, however, I still believe that it is 100% worth it to learn game. Beginner‚Äôs Hell ‚ÄúHOW DARE YOU TRY TO ASK ME MY NAME YOU FUCKING RAPIST!‚Äù 
I believe that the reason why most men don‚Äôt feel that game is worth it, is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as ‚Äúbeginner‚Äôs hell.‚Äù This is when you‚Äôre just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning , and you haven‚Äôt developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed. 
Most beginners walk around, not really knowing how to talk to women , how to carry themselves, or how to flirt in general. Because of this, women will typically have one of two responses: They pity you and ignore you They lash out and berate you for being a ‚Äúcreep,‚Äù or ‚Äúweird.‚Äù 
Of course, you may get the occasional girl who‚Äôs drunk enough to be into you, but these are few and far between. For the most part, the ‚ÄúBeginner‚Äôs Hell,‚Äù phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous. 
You will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags, who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you, and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you, he‚Äôll come over and steal her. You will have women smack you, ignore you, and tell you off‚Äîagain, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúbeginner‚Äôs hell,‚Äù for a reason. 6‚Äôs Who Think They‚Äôre 10‚Äôs 
This initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our culture‚Äôs general lack of femininity. It is extremely obvious, to anyone with eyes to see, that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on. The once praised virtues of nurturing, empathy, and kindness, have now been replaced by resting bitch face, sociopathy, and social climbing. 
This coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters, means that they‚Äôve been conditioned to believe they‚Äôre highly sought after goddesses, who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions (and in fact, they‚Äôre sometimes praised for doing so). 
This is, perhaps, one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game. Couple this with severe approach anxiety, a complete lack of masculinity, and a weak body that hasn‚Äôt been trained, and it‚Äôs very easy to see why most men don‚Äôt see that game is worth it. The Turning Point 
Once one gets beyond this initial bump, however, most of game is smooth sailing. Once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity, how to balance assertiveness with consent , and has improved his game in general, he enters what I call the turning point. 
The turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle, but it‚Äôs actually enjoyable. This is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success, such as: Drawing state from within, rather than from without Being in a state of abundance, rather than scarcity Improving other areas of your life, which creates an upwards spiral 
If you‚Äôre a newbie struggling to learn game, and you don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs worth it, I fully empathize with your pain‚Äîthe problem is that when you don‚Äôt have much game, of course learning game will be hard, because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls. 
When you start to develop the three characteristics that I mentioned, however, a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level. This allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want, rather than being at the mercy of the ugly 5 who ‚Äúmight‚Äù want to come over and hang out. Internal vs. External Drawing Of State ‚ÄúBy my age, you realize that bitches ain‚Äôt shit, but hoes and tricks.‚Äù 
The transition from drawing state from outside of you, to drawing state from within you, is literally the difference between a guy that doesn‚Äôt pull at all, and a guy that can pull Victoria‚Äôs Secret models. 
Let me explain: women typically draw state from without. This means that their emotions are governed by their environment. This is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men, why they ‚Äújust want to dance,‚Äù when a song they like comes on, and it‚Äôs why they‚Äôre generally so emotionally volatile. 
Due to their changing environments, their emotions change rapidly as well. This is why they want men to draw state from within, or in other words, not be affected by their outside environments. This is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions: it‚Äôs indicative of a man who draws state from without. 
As a man, drawing state from within has numerous benefits, the most obvious of which being that you‚Äôre perpetually in a good mood. Once you learn to make this shift, and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances, women will pick up on it like a hawk‚Äîthey‚Äôre very attuned to this type of thing, and you‚Äôll definitely notice a difference in their behavior. 
This will get them vying for YOUR attention, which will start to give you tremendous power. This will make game fun, which will lead to even more women in your life, which will begin the start of your upward spiral. The Beginning Of The Upward Spiral 
Once you begin to make this simple mindset shift, game will no longer feel like it‚Äôs not worth it. You see, game feels like it‚Äôs not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl, with a horrible personality. But, when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort, for a very gorgeous woman? That‚Äôs when game starts to be fun. 
This basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like, and to simply be happy by yourself, will create a chain reaction within your life. First, you‚Äôll start to get much more women much more easily. This will allow you to start a harem, which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship. 
This state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold. Women will sense that you‚Äôve got a ton of other women vying for your attention, and they will do the same‚Äîit‚Äôs like a magnet that just draws them in. Plus, if a girl does or says something that you dislike, you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women. 
Then, when you start to have so many women in your life, you‚Äôll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits , because you simply can‚Äôt handle sleeping with all of them. They‚Äôll invite you to parties, and try to hook you up with their friends, and you‚Äôll receive many of the social benefits that they do. Game Is Worth It (It Just Sucks At First) Getting over beginner‚Äôs hell is a lot like this. Once you get to the other side, it‚Äôs all downhill, though. 
As I have made clear, learning game at first is a huge struggle‚Äîyou will encounter massive cock blocks, a lot of negativity from women, and not to mention you‚Äôll have to deal with all of the white knights, too. But, if you can learn to get over this initial Beginner‚Äôs Hell, as I‚Äôve coined it, you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from. 
I realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first, and can feel like it isn‚Äôt worth it, but if you make a decision to put in the effort and learn it, your world will literally be 1000x better than before. If you‚Äôre struggling with learning game initially, be sure to maximize your appearance. 
Get some height increasing soles, read through some of the style articles on ROK, get a good designer haircut, and learn to perfect your appearance, at least as much as you can. Consider taking some martial arts classes to boost your confidence, as well. 
Ultimately, however, if you want to learn game and experience what it‚Äôs like to have dozens of hot girls hitting you up, you just have to bite the bullet and go out. Go clubbing, go to bars, go on trips to Las Vegas or Miami. Approach women during the day and approach them during the night‚Äîeventually you‚Äôll get over this ‚ÄúBeginner‚Äôs Hell,‚Äù and will experience an abundance of women in your life.";english;2016-11-12T21:37:22.442+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;Why It‚Äôs Absolutely Worth It To Learn Game;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong are household names because they were the first men to land on the moon. And while Neil is perhaps the more-remembered of the two because he was technically the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù to land on the moon, Buzz is just as remembered because of his unique name (while I bet most of you don‚Äôt know who the third guy was). But technicalities of who landed where first and who had cool names aside, Buzz Aldrin will forever be one of the world‚Äôs greatest historical figures because of his unrivaled accomplishments and will die a better man than the vast majority of us. 
But did you know Buzz Aldrin was an alcoholic? And after retiring he fell into a severe depression? And after his divorce his days consisted of drinking alone in his apartment, fetching KFC and booze until he entered rehab? 
It‚Äôs a hard fact to believe. Where a man who seems to have everything (fame, a super-accomplished career, and least of all, the titanium-strong professionalism and self-discipline to become an astronaut), yet he ends up down, depressed, drunk, and perhaps even suicidal like any other ordinary piece of trailer trash. But while it doesn‚Äôt make sense at first, and you can‚Äôt see how this relates to you, realize there‚Äôs a VERY good and simple reason for this fall from great heights. The Buzz Aldrin Syndrome 
Understand as we use the internet to accumulate the wisdom and knowledge to rocket past our contemporaries and excel in life, a problem is festering that you are unaware of. Additionally, much like Alzheimer‚Äôs, it is not prevalent today, but as humans advance more and live longer, it will become increasingly common. Therefore, we have the option to identify it today, prepare for it now, and thus avoid the pain and insanity that comes with having a problem we can‚Äôt identify 
or 
we can have it devastate our lives later. 
It is the Buzz Aldrin Syndrome. 
The Buzz Aldrin Syndrome is where a man achieves such greatness, such accomplishments in life, that he is truly unrivaled and peerless. While exhilarating at first, perhaps even earning one fame, riches, and fortune, the success also unintentionally alienates the person from the rest of society. At the time Buzz Aldrin only had three or four other astronauts who he could REALLY talk to, confide in, and relate to. The remaining 3 billion people on the planet (at the time) were just star-struck, wide-eyed sheep. Alas, Buzz Aldrin could be surrounded by scores of fans at a party, but still be completely alone mentally. 
The syndrome is also exacerbated as one‚Äôs pinnacle achievements in life are likely correlated with retirement. You typically progress in your career, right up until the day you retire. However, here you leave the environment and network you‚Äôve come accustomed, thrived in, and derived your entire agency from. Thus, in a very short period of time you go from the center of attention, the life of the party, the engine of the machine‚Ä¶to a retiree in California, drinking scotch, and eating KFC, longing for the days you could go back to the office again. Without the environment you derived all your worth and value from, you lose purpose in life, you lose mental stimulation, you lose your peers, and very likely sink into a crippling depression. The Perfect Storm 
There are seven factors that, when combined, create the perfect storm for the Buzz Aldrin Syndrome to form. And most ROK readers either have these traits are affected by them: 1. Technological Advancements 
Technology has always advanced, but in this particular case it affects us in two specific ways. Making living expenses cheaper and allowing for more and easier ways to make money. 
As opposed to the 1800‚Äôs, most of a man‚Äôs life was spent toiling in the field. He didn‚Äôt have time to contemplate loftier or heavier subjects much like the purpose of life, what is man‚Äôs reason for being, etc. You had to worry about the plague, tetanus, your wife dying in labor, and whether there‚Äôd be enough crops to survive the coming winter. But today, through economics, capitalism, agricultural technology, etc., a single man can basically eat for near-free at Wal-Mart or the local grocery store. 
Technology has also freed us from work. Not so much from the fact we have to work, but in terms of how much time we need to spend on it in order to survive. No more than a decade ago a young man had to work 40 hours a week, 10 for a commute, and likely for an inept baby boomer boss who was never going to let you get past the cubicle plantation. Now, with the internet not only can a man give the proverbial finger to rush hour and a commute, but his boss as well, making whatever minimalistic modicum of money he needs to survive through online entrepreneurship. In short, it has never been easier to satisfy Maslow‚Äôs first three and vital hierarchy of needs, freeing a man‚Äôs mind to pursue his own excellence, not to mention ponder his point and purpose in being here. 2. Minimalism 
It is no secret that red pill men practice, or at least pursue minimalism. We know that material things do not matter, as it is the love and friendship from our fellow man, friends, family and loved ones that matter most. You know that it would be ‚Äúnice‚Äù to have that Shelby Super Snake Mustang, but you‚Äôd never trade it in for a lifetime of conversations and cigars with your best friend. Additionally, we value our freedom above all else and refuse to subjugate ourselves to becoming debt slaves by buying things we plain don‚Äôt need. 
Jettisoning these material desires liberates more of our finite lives from work and a commute, to once again pursue our passions, our fields, our adventures, and our lives. In simply refusing to buy a McMansion and take on a car loan, we guarantee we will live more interesting and rewarding lives than 90% of our peers. 3. Avoiding Divorce And Unwanted Children 
Further saving us more time is the disproportionate number of us refusing to have children or marry (in fear of divorce). And for those of us who do marry, we are fully aware of what to look for, more or less immunizing us from divorce. 4. Knowledge of Women 
To be blunt and honestly assess the good the ‚Äúmanosphere‚Äù and red pill community have done, we have saved the lives of MILLIONS of young men, and prevented older ones from wasting what remains of theirs. If I were to estimate it, every boy born today will save at least a decade of time that would have otherwise been wasted at nightclubs, chasing tail, dating the wrong girls, and perhaps even marrying the wrong ones. 
Being a product of the 70‚Äôs, I have often talked with my Gen X peers where we estimated what we could have done had we not wasted the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs chasing women we were either never going to get, or would regret catching. We could have easily had doctorates, houses built by our own hands, much better careers, not to mention better mental health as we would have avoided all the batshit insane women we sifted through. Young men today, especially those who consume the Red Pill, will easily have a decade of time on us by simply learning from our mistakes . 5. Self-Improvement 
Unless you are in the VirginTOW community, you know how important self-improvement is to a man‚Äôs life. You have this one finite life on this planet, and not only is it imperative you enjoy it, but you must ensure it is a masterpiece of art in whatever endeavors you choose to excel in. This may not land you on the moon, but you will achieve greatness and excellence in some capacity or another. Music, literature, innovation, philosophy, being a good dad, something. You will not idly stand by, sitting on your ass, majoring in sociology, or collecting a welfare check as you knock up baby mama after baby momma. You will be notable and leave a positive legacy on this world. 6. Entrepreneurship or STEM 
Most of you know not to major in stupid, worthless shit . You also know that for the majority of us, entrepreneurship or self-employment is the only form of employment that we can tolerate. Because of this, two things will happen in your life. One, you will save an inordinate amount of time spent trying to make a go at a career that just isn‚Äôt in demand in the real world. You will work as an engineer, a programmer, a doctor, or some REAL profession/trade, which will not only pay you a handsome wage, but make your life incredibly easier. Two, at some point in time you will come up with an idea that will either cement your success in your career or outright launch a successful entrepreneurial endeavor. This will free you from your dependence on traditional employers, ensure your financial future is sound, but it will also likely lead towards you achieving your legacy in excellence. 
In the veritable sea of liberal arts majors, not one of their millions will ever make anything of themselves. They will simply waste away, doubling down on masters degrees and doctorates in their hopelessly worthless fields. Worse, they will be crippled until death with student loans and inadequate compensation as they beg and vote for other people‚Äôs money. They will die like most, unmentionable, irrelevant, and forgotten. 
You will not. 7. A High Intelligence 
To make all of this a reality you need the raw intellectual capacity to bring this to fruition. While no studies have been done, if you have the independent mindedness to be reading ROK, I‚Äôd estimate the average IQ of ROK readers to be 120. However, keep in mind while being highly intelligent is an asset, it is also a curse . Like ROK, you are on ‚Äúthe fringe.‚Äù And because of that you are not only going to receive an inordinate amount of flak from the rest of ‚Äúnormie‚Äù society, but relating to the rest of it, let alone finding a healthy and rewarding social life in it, is going to prove next to impossible. 
When you combine these traits and conditions, you have what is arguably the perfect environment for a great life to form. You need very little to survive because you won‚Äôt waste your resources on frivolous material things in life. You also have very little liabilities or responsibilities, not only because you‚Äôre a minimalist, but are likely not going to marry or have children. The lion‚Äôs share of your time and energies can be dedicated towards achieving excellence and greatness in your life. 
And if you‚Äôve done it right, you‚Äôll be two decades ahead of your Gen X peers since you avoided worthless degrees and leap-frogged your philosophical understanding of life. You will be accomplished, you will be successful, you will have paid a fraction of the mental toll to get there, and you will indeed be an amazing man, the world‚Äôs most interesting perhaps. You have reached the so called ‚Äúfinish line‚Äù much earlier and faster than Buzz Aldrin‚Ä¶ 
and that‚Äôs when your real problems start. You Weren‚Äôt Meant to Be Here 
Understand that while the goal of man was to secure unlimited food, resources, and security so that he may pursue an unlimited and happy life, the human mind has no experience being here. The entire existence of humankind has been struggle, suffering, fighting, and striving for such a life, but also 99. % of the time failing . And over the course of human history the human brain has had 2 million years experience and conditioning in failure, NOT success. 
This leads to an ironic and perhaps the most tragic instances in human experiences. A man finally gets what he wants. Wealth, health, success, excellence, legacy, everything. But upon attaining it he can‚Äôt enjoy it because the human mind is not programmed to. He not only realizes this rare success doesn‚Äôt result in happiness or a perpetual life-long glee that will see him to his grave, but there‚Äôs nothing left to conquer. There‚Äôs nothing left to do. The game of life is over, and like Red Dead Redemption, it gets mighty boring just riding your horse around after you conquer the game. 
Worse, because of the unique characteristics required to attain this excellence any man ‚Äúlucky‚Äù enough to be this successful is in one way or another ostracized from the rest of his peers. Professionally, romantically, intellectually, some way or another, to be in that . 1% you have to be a statistical freak. Alas, you get to suffer the true symptoms of The Buzz Aldrin Syndrome. 
Peerlessness ‚Äì While your friends are pumping out children or your colleagues are trying to get out from underneath their McMansion mortgage and impending divorce, you may be avoiding these dreaded fates, but you are also alone. No longer are these the college days where your intellectual peers in equal life-circumstances can hang out, chat, philosophize, and in numbers that seem endless. Slowly, but surely, they will get picked off like German Messerschmitts in WWII by the forces of life and you will be left alone. 
Understand this has nothing to do with your pursuit of greatness or achieving excellence in life, but is outside of your control as these people fall within the bell distribution curve of averageness. They choose these lives, meaning it‚Äôs not the statistical freak leaving them, but them leaving the statistical freak (no matter how loudly they claimed in college they were going to live life ‚Äúdifferently‚Äù). And don‚Äôt think that you can simply recoup your former social life by joining them by being average, putting on a sports jersey, ordering some Buffalo Wild wings, cheering on the local sportsball team. Your mind won‚Äôt tolerate it. 
You are peerless. Get used to it. 
Boredom ‚Äì Without people you get bored. No matter how intelligent you are, you are still human. And humans are indeed social creatures as they derive their entire life value from others, not things. But the paradox those suffering from the Buzz Aldrin Syndrome face is that while you would like to be social with people, the vast majority of people are either too common, too stupid, or just too boring, especially when compared to being by yourself. 
Go to that same Buffalo Wild wings to hear loud, drunk, divorced SWPL men in their 40‚Äôs cheer on the local swingystick team? 
Or read Marcus Aurelius ? 
Go to a movie where Jason Bourne discovers another mole in the CIA‚Ä¶again‚Ä¶who set up his father‚Ä¶again‚Ä¶.where he drives around Europe shooting the place up‚Ä¶.again? 
Or binge on some history podcasts ? 
I know! How about you go to a party where you‚Äôll hear the same conversations from men about the sportsball game they just saw at Buffalo Wild wings, as they lament their inability to get out from underneath their mortgage, while the wives gossip about their painfully pointless government-make-work careers while talking about how great the cake is? 
Or road trip out west and do some hiking in the desert? 
The larger point is not only are the VAST majority of people not intellectually stimulating enough, but good luck finding enough of them who have the freedom and finances to do anything besides hit up happy hour when wifey lets them out of the house. 
And then there‚Äôs‚Ä¶ 
Frustration ‚Äì Being unencumbered by the daily scourge of chores, children, finances, mortgages, and commutes, your mind will be unshackled to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits it wishes to pursue. You‚Äôll solve world problems in an afternoon that politicians are taking eons to not solve. You‚Äôll come up with some and many viable business ideas, discarding most of them because you have not the time to put them all into execution. You‚Äôll see the obvious solutions to making your friends‚Äô and love ones‚Äô lives infinitely better, but they‚Äôll have the horse-blinders on so tight, they‚Äôll ignore your wisdom. Or you‚Äôll make a great scientific discovery at work, while your boss dismisses it away and threatens to fire you for having an independent thought. It is simply the real world telling you, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt control everything, and matter of fact, most of this world was not meant for you.‚Äù 
Obviously, you can see where depression, alcoholism, and ennui set in. You can see where the pursuit and successful attainment of excellence in life can lead to unintentional alienation and ostracization from the rest of society. And since society is where all humans ‚Äì geniuses or not, successful or not ‚Äì get their value, you can see the downside to zooming past the ‚Äúfinish line of life,‚Äù especially at increasingly earlier ages as technology and minimalism permit it. 
The solution is in part to find quality people who can be life-long friends, colleagues, peers, and comrades. Perhaps even get married if you find the right girl. And no matter what, keep yourself and your mind occupied. Hobbies, interests, pursuits, etc. Inactivity is death. But ultimately, what is going to best prepare you for what‚Äôs coming is to simply know it‚Äôs coming. 
Nirvana and heaven are not at the other side of that finish line. An active and rewarding social life, full of close friends and loved ones are the not the reward for success. And it certainly isn‚Äôt a life-long party until you die. It is a mentally-barren landscape much like the moon, a place Buzz has been to both literally and metaphorically.";english;2016-11-13T19:09:28.982+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;Buzz Aldrin Is A Warning Of How Success Can Lead To Depression;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

Hollywood movies, Disney cartoons, and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding union, but how much of that narrative has been a lie? Is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair bond?
I began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root. Love is a fleeting emotion, and like all emotions, it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky. Why have I been taught to select my life partner based on an emotion? I‚Äôm surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a house, applying for a job, or doing my personal finances, but when it comes to choosing a human being that I‚Äôm supposed to spend the rest of my life with, I‚Äôm advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them all.
Another major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged marriages, where partners are picked based on purely practical matters, have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates ( 1 , 2 , 3 ). While there are multiple reasons for divorce in any society, it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates .
Romance was invented 
It turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority. Romanticism, a movement that began in the 18th century, put romantic love at the forefront, not just for individuals but nations as well, all from a central thesis of individualism. It wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel .
The movement came primarily from bourgeois youth, who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings.
‚Ä¶the Romantic Movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois conventions, bourgeois society and morality. To be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young Romantic. The Romantics were, in fact, bourgeois origins, who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows. ( Source )
[‚Ä¶] Romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by Bourgeois society. ( Source 
They sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors , many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù and ‚Äúinequality‚Äù to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it. Combined with the fact that SJWs also trump feelings over logic, it‚Äôs clear to see how romanticists were proto-SJWs, whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of tradition.
Romantics re-defined what relationships should be based on 
Prior to the romantic era, companionate love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical writings.
Passionate love is the arousal-driven emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of happiness, and can also give people feelings of anguish. Companionate love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two people, and gives people feelings of peace. Scientists have described the stage of passionate love as ‚Äúbeing on cocaine,‚Äù since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used. ( Source )
Besides Song Of Songs in the Old Testament , writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate love, and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new marriages, but it‚Äôs this passionate love that we‚Äôre told to strive for, of feeling like you‚Äôve been swept up in an exciting whirlwind, before publishing the gory details on Buzzfeed or in a bestseller like Eat Pray Love, authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce .
Women of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic love, and why wouldn‚Äôt they? It‚Äôs much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by non-committal alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you husband, king, and God. Women were given the chance to pick between excitement or responsibility, and we know what they have chosen.
The works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period. The Romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers. ( Source )
The modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love Jewish psychologist Robert Sternberg proposed the popular triangular theory of love , which is often used today as defining the love ideal. This theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful relationship.
Anyone who takes an introductory psychology course, or who reads a pop psychology book, will be exposed to this theory, and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship. If it‚Äôs not there, the presumption is that the relationship is no longer ‚Äúconsummate‚Äù and far short of ideal.
Believing that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of it, because when a woman no longer ‚Äúfeels passion,‚Äù she will walk away knowing that experts like Sternberg would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving. And this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves. They have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding vows, especially upon realizing that they initiate 80% of divorces .
Romanticism and the rise of nationalism 
If nationalism came out of the romantic era, and passionate love was a mistake, does that mean nationalism is also a mistake?
One of Romanticism‚Äôs key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of national languages and folklore, and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning.
[‚Ä¶] Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. ( Source )
Upon closer inspection, it‚Äôs easy to see that the ruling agenda of today, globalism , is essentially ‚Äúworld nationalism.‚Äù Instead of loving your neighbor, and only those who share your unique traditions or race, you‚Äôre supposed to love everyone in the world , because it‚Äôs evil to think that there are large differences between a German businessman in a Hugo Boss suit and a Tutsi villager with a lip plate the size of a grapefruit.
The romantic ideal of nationalism is not Adolph Hitler, but George Soros , who insists on loving everyone in the world from the depths of your heartfelt human compassion. A nationalism based on genetics and local bonds will no doubt serve citizens better than a ‚Äúglobal nationalism‚Äù where you‚Äôre supposed to care for those who are nothing like you.
How should men choose their life partners? 
It‚Äôs clear that using romantic love and passion as your primary standard for long-term relationships will lead to failure and maybe even personal catastrophe. You‚Äôll easily come to this conclusion by evaluating your past relationships and the mistakes you‚Äôve made on women who you had intense passion for.
Instead, practicality must be the order of the day. You must logically evaluate any woman you intend to be with for more than a casual relationship by weighing her values, beliefs, and sexual history. This is easier said than done because we‚Äôve been so brainwashed to believe passion is important, but it simply makes the most amount of sense. Find a woman the same way you would find a new job or buy a new house, and be wary of women who picked you based more on passion than practical matters.
It may sound cold to search for your wife like you would a business partner, but that is exactly what she is. The day-to-day life of a family home is far more business and economics than love, and so you should come to the easy conclusion that that‚Äôs what you must use to form a stable home.
Understand, however, that we do not live in a traditional and patriarchal society that aids us in our search for a virtuous woman. Instead, society is encouraging women to corrupt themselves, sexually and physically, in the name of empowerment and independence, making our search exceedingly difficult. This is one of the costs we have to pay for living in the modern world. Some men will be able to overcome it, but many men won‚Äôt, and will fail in their search for a woman they can create a family with.
But at least we are now armed with the knowledge of what it takes to have a more successful long-term relationship. It‚Äôs not romantic love or butterflies in the stomach, but a matter of practicality. Logically evaluate her past, her values, and her beliefs to make sound predictions of how she‚Äôll behave in the future. From this evaluation will come a logical decision that is likely to endure, instead of relying on emotion, which changes as readily as the direction of the wind.

His reforms were a product of his personality and his vision for what he wanted Russia to become; and sometimes in history, personality matters more than those vague ‚Äúhistorical forces‚Äù that professional historians like to imagine as controlling the destinies of men.
Russia in his day was still half-barbarous. To rule her he had to be an absolute monarch, and never for a moment doubted his right to be so. His personal habits say much about him: he had little need for sleep, regularly working for fourteen hours (or more) per day. Alcohol was considered, then as now, an acceptable escape from the drudgery of rule; but he knew when to limit his intake, and forbade his ministers from excessive consumption. His sexual appetites were as normal as any man‚Äôs, but he showed little interest in the kind of conspicuous indulgence that characterized most of his contemporaries in western Europe.
He did make a point of choosing mistresses of lowly origin, rather than from titled families; he had no desire for intellectual competition in the bedroom. When Frederick II of Denmark teased him about the type of women he chose, his response was ‚ÄúBrother, my women do not cost me much, but yours cost you thousands of crowns which might be better spent elsewhere.‚Äù
He chose to spend most of his time in the city that bore his name, St. Petersburg. He liked maritime affairs, and wanted to be near the sea. He disliked the atmosphere of Moscow, with its abundance of clergy and freezing winters. It was the army that first felt the effect of his modernization programs. Peter introduced conscription, a professional officer class, and defined periods of service; his naval program was less effective, and most of the vessels built during his reign were not of high quality.
He realized that he would never be able to make Russia into a great power unless he changed the mentality and outlook of the people. And like many rulers before and after him, he underestimated just how difficult this task would prove to be. After his death, many of his reforms were permitted to wither on the vine; but at least some tentative first steps had been made that future monarchs might draw inspiration from. By imperial decree he banished beards in 1698 (an exception was made for the Orthodox Patriarch); this was a shocking step in a country where whiskers had become a symbol of piety and fidelity. Those who insisted on keeping them could do so by paying an income-adjusted annual tax. We are told that some distraught peasants obsessively saved their shaved facial hair, lest they incur some disfavor from the saints.
But there was method to Peter‚Äôs apparent madness. He understood that appearance and thought are connected, and that if a man wished to change one, he had to change the other. In 1700 Peter decreed that all royal officials had to adopt Western-style clothing. Trousers and cloaks were acceptable; caftans or overly ‚Äúoriental‚Äù garb was not. Like Kemal Ataturk two centuries later, he had no patience for backsliders or protesters, whom he swept aside ruthlessly. In social relations, he ended for good the traditional practice of secluding women from public intercourse with men, a habit that had probably been an inheritance from the Mongols.
These reforms gained Peter some bitter enemies among the clergy. For centuries the Russian ecclesiastic establishment had held a near monopoly on education and rural social life; Peter‚Äôs reforms threatened to erode this base, and they saw in him an implacable enemy of traditional belief. They also suspected him of having had too much contact with western Europeans, a fact that‚Äìit seemed to them‚Äìmade him nearly an atheist. Peter did not help matters by openly mocking their rituals and folkways; as he saw matters, it was his responsibility to bring Russia up to par with the other advanced nations of the day, and resistance from obscurantist clerics could not be tolerated.
Peter solved this problem for a time by making himself the head of the Orthodox Church in 1700 when Patriarch Adrian died. He did not appoint a successor, and went one step further in 1721 by abolishing the title of patriarch altogether. In its place he formed a council of clerics that he himself would appoint; with this measure, the Church effectively became an arm of the state. Ecclesiastical grumbling was audible, but Peter wisely refused to venture into disputes with the priests over religious doctrine. He cared about power, not theology.
Slowly he made progress in industrialization. This frankly could only be done with dictatorial power, and to this end he reorganized the traditional Russian boyar system. In place of the old aristocracy, a new one arose that was based on military and civil function. His rule saw some success in mining and textile work: when Peter died in 1725, Russia was exporting iron, and state-sponsored factories made modest gains in cloth manufacture. Protective tariffs were used to shelter the new industries from suffocating foreign competition.To pay for all this, Peter unashamedly taxed everyone in his realm to the limits of their tolerance. State tax revenues rose from 1.4 million rubles in 1680 to 8.5 million in 1724. The majority of this revenue went to the military.
A Russian boyar
Ambitious plans existed for education, too. Peter ordered the old Slavonic alphabet used by the Church to be replaced by a new system (based on Greek letters). He imported printing presses, founded institutes, and organized professional associations to spread the ideas that were current at the time in western Europe.
What was the net result of all this effort? The picture was a mixed one. Reformers are not usually popular, as by their very nature they are required to focus attentions in different directions. Men and horses do not appreciate new stirrups. The peasantry‚Äìalready used to a harsh existence‚Äìfound themselves taxed to exhaustion; Moscow became filled with paupers who alternated between banditry and begging. The nobles hated him with the same ferocity as the French nobles hated Richelieu, and for the very same reason: because he forced them to serve the nation rather than each other.
As his unpopularity grew, Peter resorted more and more to the whip and the dungeon to implement his designs. Perhaps there was no other way. But at the very least, his example pointed the way for future authoritarian leaders who would drag Russia, kicking and screaming, into the modern era. Some of his achievements were lasting and significant, and some were not. In history, even great men must contend with the limitations of their era, and try to balance their own vision with the possibilities granted them by circumstance. It is on this precarious tightrope that all great men walk.

Since nobody really pays attention to them anymore, you might have missed some of the more entertaining butthurt spouted by shameless propagandists posing as journalists.
2016 election night coverage on the propaganda news channels is a lesson in hilarity when examining the reaction of lamestream media talking heads. What is most entertaining about Trump‚Äôs ascendancy to the Oval Office is that it was totally unexpected, catching cocksure Marxists at CNN and other alphabet channels completely off guard.
Let‚Äôs go over some of the more entertaining reactions last Tuesday.
5. Hillary Shill Martha Raddatz Breaks Down In Tears 
Over at ABC, the wrinkled old Hillary shill Martha Raddatz was at a loss for words as she attempted to perform an off the cuff hamster rationalization to fellow Clinton operative George Staphylococcus, explaining why The Bitch lost the election.
Raddatz looked like her mother just died as victory turned into defeat for the criminal Hillary Clinton. She‚Äôs sure to be moving from a pack of smokes a day to two packs a day as the reality of the election continues to settle into her pea brain over the next 4 years. Her tears say more than her boilerplate language ever could.
4. Bernstein Plays The Race Card 
To the mainstream media, white people voting in accordance with their own self-interest is racist. In fact, white people acting in any other manner than total subservience is racist to CNN. Washington Post ‚Äújournalist‚Äù Carl Bernstein even went so far as to say Trump‚Äôs election is ‚Äútragic and dangerous‚Äù as despondent and quite possibly drugged CNN propagandists looked on. Bernstein seemed most upset about Trump‚Äôs immigration policy proposals, in which Mexico will no longer be able to flagrantly let its citizens violate U.S. immigration law.
Bernstein completely forgot the racism white people have endured all year long at the hands of Black Lives Matter, La Raza and other black and brown supremacist groups.
3. Chris Matthews Goes Into Hamster Rationalization Mode 
Hamster rationalizations are usually reserved for women, but effeminate, low-T manlets like Chris Matthews also have them. His first spin of the hamster wheel makes him say Hillary won the debates. She didn‚Äôt. Then he says she had the best ad campaign. Nobody believes advertising or anything you say, anymore Chris. Then Matthews says she had the best ground game. She might have, but she was a terrible candidate. The half-man, half-alligator James Carville looked ready to give Chris a hug as the reality of Hillary‚Äôs defeat began to settle in on MSNBC.
2. The Racist Van Jones Whines About White People 
Van Jones looked like he needed a change of underwear as he fell back on tired, old leftist talking points from the 1960s about the evil white male ‚Äîespecially white males that haven‚Äôt been turned into geldings. He then goes on with an emotional overreaction to say families will be afraid to have breakfast the next day because whitey got back into office. LMFAO. Really, dude?
He then says immigrants are afraid now that Trump is going to be President. No Van, immigrants aren‚Äôt afraid. Illegal hordes who figuratively if not literally say ‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù to U.S. immigration law are afraid, as they should be.
Jones then goes on to make a supremely ironic quote as he talks about a so-called white-lash: He says Trump‚Äôs campaign was based on ‚ÄúThrowing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others.‚Äù Umm, isn‚Äôt that what the entire platform of the Democratic party is, Van? Throwing away, nay, crucifying white men to appeal more deeply to others ? Your entire career is based on just that, Mr. Jones.
1. CBS Does A Mea Culpa CBS published an article admitting how badly the press is biased
CBS was so stunned it did a full mea culpa on the network‚Äôs shoddy coverage of the 2016 election. This stunning article entitled ‚ÄúThe Unbearable Smugness of the Press‚Äù needed to be written 10 years ago. Better late than never. CBS actually echoed what we in the manosphere and alt-right have been saying since day one with the Op-Ed piece.
This is all symptomatic of modern journalism‚Äôs great moral and intellectual failing: its unbearable smugness . Had Hillary Clinton won, there‚Äôd be a winking ‚Äúwe did it‚Äù feeling in the press, a sense that we were brave and called Trump a liar and saved the republic.
The Eyeball network even admitted the contempt the network has for men like us.
So much for that. The audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate, it turned out, was rather limited. This was particularly true when it came to voters, the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it. Trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him. They hate us, and have for some time.
And can you blame them? Journalists love mocking Trump supporters. We insult their appearances. We dismiss them as racists and sexists. We emote on Twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other, and yet we reject their feelings as invalid.
Damn. At least some people over there know why we hate them. (That includes this former mainstream media news anchor who defected!)
Shameless Activism Got Marxism? It‚Äôs the guiding philosophy of the alphabet channels
Anyone who has the capacity to perform an iota of critical thinking knows the mainstream media is NOT on the side of the average American. It hates and seethes at traditionalists and works to tear down every institution of Western civilization while attempting to impale the most hated of creatures on this planet, the Evil White Male.
The rebuke of a sorry candidate like Hillary when the socialist shills thought she was a shoe-in caught the smug son of a bitches off guard. Their reactions are priceless, and need to be documented and remembered. These reactions are undeniable proof that blogs like Return Of Kings and web sites like Breitbart and Drudge are sorely needed, indispensable resources in this day and age.
We have not been getting the truth from media for generations. And now, as alternative voices appear, the rift between the two versions of reality grows wider and deeper. The once mainstream media have become nothing but shameless activists for New World Order socialism. The election night ‚Äúhorror show‚Äù only solidifies this point.
We should be proud to be activists pushing our own agenda, if nothing else to balance the scales. The media are NOT friends of the American public. Ultimately, the tired old Socialist media must be dismantled in order for freedom and traditionalism to survive .

My father was a high-ranking student radical poobah and still thinks Castro is the bees' knees. Although this makes me technically a red diaper baby, I rejected all that baloney early on. These days, I write stories - mostly comedy science fiction - as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice, political commentary, and my writing projects. November 15, 2016 Culture 
John Walker Lindh grew up in the Washington, D.C. area. His family brought him to California when he was ten. In another ten years, he would become known as the American Taliban. While in Afghanistan, he was known as Sulayman al-Faris, one of several Arabic monikers he‚Äôs used over the years. Johnny joins the jihad There are moments when one realizes one‚Äôs vacation is really starting to suck. 
When he was twelve, the young Lindh saw Spike Lee‚Äôs rather hagiographic film biography about Malcolm X. That began his fascination with Islam. While a teenager, he used the evocative email [email protected] and made several postings about rap music on Usenet. Sometimes he pretended to be Black, even having the nerve to ‚Äúdis‚Äù Dr. Dre : 
$hort Dog does hip hop no glory Wack like Dr Dre and his made-up gangster stories Sellout house nigga living honkey dory Saying he‚Äôs broke in his own pool doing laps All these playground MC‚Äôs fall off like scabs Skills disappear like alaka abracadab 
Dr Dre‚Äôs a disgrace selling out to the talcolm He‚Äôll be left dead and naked in the outcome Word to brother Malcolm Dre shirts and hat‚Äôs when will we see his cereal? 
So who‚Äôs the poseur there, anyway? I‚Äôm not sure whether to laugh at the sheer impertinence, or cry at the abuse of the English language. 
When he was sixteen, he formally converted, beginning his fateful journey. Meanwhile, his family situation was on shaky ground. His father turned gay , living part-time with his male lover , and eventually divorced. 
John began his world travels, twice venturing to Yemen, both times for nearly a year. Later, he stayed at a Pakistani madrassa. In May 2001, he went to Afghanistan to fight on behalf of the Taliban. Unfortunately for him, after September 11, American forces went to war with the Taliban. He was captured on November 25 after his unit surrendered in Kunduz. 
The CIA questioned him, and he claimed to be an Irishman. (That must have been an interesting conversation, perhaps ‚ÄúAch, begorrah, top o‚Äô the mornin‚Äô to ye!‚Äù Presumably, pretending to be black again wouldn‚Äôt have gotten him very far.) Shortly after, the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising , and Lindh escaped. Hundreds died, including Mike Spann, one of his interrogators. After that, he was recaptured and‚Äîfollowing some rough treatment, not that I‚Äôm shedding any tears about it‚Äîquestioned again. He announced defiantly that he wasn‚Äôt in the Taliban, but rather Al Qaeda. His actions sealed his doom. 
Fighting for the Taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part. His actions after being captured were even dumber. What could he have done differently? In the beginning, he could‚Äôve said he was interested in Islam, and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad. Then he could have lied and told them he was press-ganged into the Taliban, and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen. 
He could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attempt‚Äîpotentially sparing many lives on both sides‚Äîas well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself. Had he given a helpful warning about the uprising, likely they would‚Äôve concluded he was small fry and let him go. After that, he could‚Äôve become the star of the daytime TV talk shows. Then he could‚Äôve given speeches on the anti-war circuit, helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really aren‚Äôt that bad or whatever. 
Instead, he ended up faced with ten criminal charges, which could‚Äôve meant three life sentences plus ninety years. Finally getting smart, he copped a plea for twenty years, with the possibility of three off for good behavior. Now, he‚Äôs in Federal prison, making the news back in 2012 by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer . What went wrong? 
As Bush the Elder put it, Lindh was ‚Äúsome misguided Marin County hot-tubber.‚Äù Later, he apologized profusely for the remark. Still, I have to say that Bush 41 was onto something with that one; all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts . 
Things could‚Äôve been different. Lindh didn‚Äôt have to become a renegade. If he‚Äôd made other choices, he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society, rather than counting the days in a prison cell. Still, his environment bears some responsibility for what he became. 
He was raised in the Catholic faith, but a stronger grounding in it‚Äîas well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about Islam to balance out the picture ‚Äîmight have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad. (A liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all that‚Äôs bad. Or has liberalism become too wishy-washy to assert its own values?) There wasn‚Äôt much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path; his mother converted to Buddhism and his father left for the gay community. 
For that matter, if he had acquired an appreciation for good music‚Äîbe it Mozart or Metallica‚Äîperhaps he wouldn‚Äôt have been so fascinated by irritating rap music. What kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be Black and laughably accuses Dr. Dre of selling out? On that note, as for Malcolm X, didn‚Äôt Lindh have some cultural icons of his own? I have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own Irish-American heritage. 
All this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an ‚Äú anything goes ‚Äù environment. Islam speaks in absolutes, enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct, and they fight for what they believe in. (I can‚Äôt fault them too much for that, although I disagree with their theology and actions on many points.) 
Going further, Islam offers paradise for believers‚Äîpromising seventy virgins to their martyrs‚Äîand eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned; there‚Äôs nothing wishy-washy about it. Indeed, embracing radical Islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù world view. I certainly don‚Äôt agree with Lindh‚Äôs choices, but I can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism . 
This certainly isn‚Äôt the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy. Jane Fonda‚Äôs North Vietnam adventure comes to mind; an action she now regrets. More recently, there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in Iraq for their pal Saddam. For all their posturing, none of them got themselves blown up over there. (Leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified, 500 fewer Social Justice Warriors would‚Äôve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit.) 
Then there‚Äôs the odd case of Matthew Todd Miller , a Californian who went to North Korea, tore up his visa, and announced he was seeking political asylum. That one‚Äôs an iffy case though; later he said ‚ÄúI just wanted to speak to an ordinary North Korean person about normal things.‚Äù Kids these days‚Ä¶ In summary Don‚Äôt let this happen to our youth. They must not grow up culturally bereft. 
In times past, children were taught about their country‚Äôs heritage, instructed in their culture, and pride in their nation was instilled in them. It was a given that these were presented as good things. These days‚Äîat least in much of the Western world‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt happening. We can‚Äôt count on the educational system‚Äîand certainly the media‚Äîto do that any more. 
Because of decades of cultural Marxism , young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization. ‚ÄúAll societies, beliefs, and ways of life are equal, except yours are terrible.‚Äù Those who don‚Äôt see through that baloney end up rootless, alienated, and disconnected from their own culture. Some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful. This is basically what Social Justice Weenies think, something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue. 
This will have to change, of course. Hopefully, the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural Marxism are standing in the unemployment line. For now, we‚Äôll have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing, and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity. Teach them about their roots and why that‚Äôs important. Don‚Äôt let the TV be your child‚Äôs babysitter. ‚ÄúAnything goes‚Äù is not a standard by which to raise our youth.";english;2016-11-16T05:08:20.478+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;The Sad Saga Of John Walker Lindh, Rebel Without A Clue;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

To launch a Return Of Kings t-shirt shop, I decided to go with Shopify because of how much easier it is to launch than a self-hosted store. I signed up with them, paid for one year of service, and did a pre-launch with a small group of readers, which resulted in 55 orders. As I began fulfilling them, Shopify pulled the plug on the entire store without warning, both the public storefront and the administrative backend with all our data. 
Because of Shopify‚Äôs decision, my customers couldn‚Äôt access their order status, I had no way of informing them of what happened, and I couldn‚Äôt fulfill remaining orders. They put both me and 55 individuals in the lurch for no legitamate reason, forcing me to threaten legal action in order to get enough information to complete fulfillment of all orders. The Backstory 
There are many open source solutions for hosting a web store. The problem with them is that it takes extra time to create the store and maintain it, compared to services like Shopify, Squarespace, Bigcommerce, Magento, and others. To get the ROK store up and running as quickly as possible, I picked Shopify because of their competitive prices, not knowing that I was in for a far greater price down the road. 
After I set up the store, featuring photos of yours truly in our first t-shirt, I collected email addresses of those who were most interested with participating in the pre-launch. I sent this group an email announcing the store and 55 of them took action, ordering a t-shirt or two. The shirt in question 
During this time, I received an email from a Shopify risk analyst by the name of Justin. He asked me to send in identification, which I was happy to do, and then asked me for more information: 
Thanks for signing up with Shopify Payments and providing your ID. 
In order to complete this initial review and ensure payments continue to be sent to your account we would need a little bit more information. 
If you could send me any documentation you may have to validate the business that would be great. Examples would be a business bank statement, business license or business registration documents. 
Could you also confirm where you‚Äôre primarily operating your business from? 
I sent in my business incorporation documents, my IRS employer number designation, a recent bank statement (from my US-based bank), and a note of how I often travel through Eastern Europe, but that my business, bank accounts, and tax status all reside in the United States. In spite of that, Shopify unjustly classified me as a foreign business and gave me no means to dispute it. 
Unfortunately, Shopify Payments is currently only available to companies that are based in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and the United States, so we are not able to help with payments for your site right now. It‚Äôs frustrating for us to have to turn down good businesses, but we need to make sure we‚Äôre abiding by both US and international regulations. This means that any successful charges you have will be transferred to you on schedule, but you won‚Äôt be able to use Shopify Payments to accept any further payments. [‚Ä¶] 
Despite the information provided, our payment processing partner needs to ensure that the shops are based, operating from and have a substantial presence in the United States. 
Ultimately, their decision is final and we must respect it. 
According to the United States Federal Government and the IRS, my company is American and liable to pay American taxes, but to Shopify, I‚Äôm not an American business. The repercussion from this was that I couldn‚Äôt use Shopify‚Äôs own payment system (Shopify Payments) and had to pay a 2% extra commision on all orders, but this wasn‚Äôt a huge setback since there were many other payment options. I stayed the course because I wanted to do an on-time opening for my readers. I could always change stores later when it was convenient for me. The Disaster 
I have a worker based in the United States who maintains the shirt inventory and is charge of shipping them out. He printed most of the shipping labels for the first batch of orders and got ready for shipment. Before he was finished, I tried to log into the admin area of the store to monitor his progress and saw this: 
The public storefront was also taken down. There was no longer any way for me to know who my customers were and what they ordered. I couldn‚Äôt even send them an email. I then received this from Justin: 
Hello, 
I‚Äôm afraid that after reviewing your information and website we believe your business presents a level of risk for customer disputes that we will be unable to support on Shopify. 
We will transfer your existing payments to you, but will be unable to accept any additional payments on your behalf from Shopify Payments. 
I‚Äôm sorry we won‚Äôt be able to help with your business. 
Regards, 
Justin 
After I read this email, I was absolutely livid. I‚Äôve been doing business on the internet for over fifteen years, and have never had a situation where a company pulled the rug out from under me and my customers in a way that I would personally classify as fraud. 
They allowed me to take 55 orders, begin processing them, and then removed all access so I could not complete fulfillment. Imagine if you bought a shirt from me and then tried to access the store to see the status of your order. You would have no way to know what‚Äôs going on and would probably think that I took your money and ran. Shopify created a situation of unneeded worry for 55 individuals while directly hurting my reputation as if I‚Äôm running some sort a scam operation. The Phone Call To Support 
I called support and got on the line with a Level 1 support tech. I told him the situation as calmly as I could. His response: send an email reply to Justin. This was unacceptable because politely complying with him through email beforehand had only resulted in the deletion of my entire store without warning. I demanded to speak with someone from the risk department but the support tech told me there was no way to patch me through since he was working remotely. I was not calling Shopify‚Äôs main office but someone sitting in the middle of nowhere in his pajamas. 
I also told the support tech that there was no further information asked of me, that this was a unilateral closing of my shop while I was in the middle of fulfillment. If Shopify is so worried about fraud, why would they leave 55 individuals in a position where they would believe they got defrauded and start initiating chargebacks with their credit card companies? I had no choice but to threaten legal action. I told the support tech that if Shopify doesn‚Äôt give me a way to complete these 55 orders, I would pursue all legal means as a response to what I saw as fraud. 
The support tech put me on hold. After a few minutes of chatting with the risk team, he said that they have given him permission to send me a CSV file of all my orders. I decided that this was enough to satisfy the 55 individuals who purchased from me, but it still didn‚Äôt allow me an easyway to process exchanges or refunds if one of my customers was unsatisfied with the shirt. 
Before ending the call with the support tech, I told him to relay to Justin and his team that they have created so much ill will by the way they have treated me that I will ensure that everyone knows exactly what they did, not just to me but also to my customers, who had an unfortunate experience because of their e-commerce platform. 
Using the CSV file I received, I was able to contact my customers to let them know of the situation and complete fulfillment. Many of them have already received their t-shirts in the mail. The Lesson 
Shopify has every right to choose who to do business with, and I would not be particularly upset if they said I have to go elsewhere after fulfilling open orders , but the way they removed all access from my store is absolutely reprehensible and the stuff of nightmares for a business owner. No owner wants to wake up one day and find that everything is gone with no way to contact his customers. I have never been treated so poorly by an American internet business before, and I‚Äôm confident that any business who treats people in this way won‚Äôt be in business for long. 
Maybe my situation was special, as I am often abroad, but Shopify operates as if its customers are not even allowed to take a vacation out of the country. If you log in from a certain IP address pool, their algorithms go crazy and here comes Justin to hit the delete button on your store with one click. 
Whatever the reason, it‚Äôs important for existing and potential Shopify customers to know that it doesn‚Äôt take much for them to shut you down at any moment and for any cause. They will take all your information and prevent you from contacting customers or fulfilling orders. Your only recourse to receive your data is to threaten legal action, and that may be no guarantee of success. If any of my friends ask me about which web store platform to use, I will strongly warn them against Shopify. 
As for the ROK store, I‚Äôve decided to try the open source method. Hopefully we will be ready for orders again within two months.

We, modern men, need to constantly improve ourselves in a hostile world like ours that tries to debase us. While the lesser ‚Äúmen‚Äù embrace weakness and degeneracy, we must embrace strength and discipline. While whiners complain about how unfair the world is and how it‚Äôs better to just disengage, we must engage the world with greater willpower and defeat our enemies. Towards this end, I propose that we become both resilient and antifragile in every way possible. 
The following are ways you can turn a seemingly negative circumstances into strengths. 1. Stress 
Although stress has been maligned as the plague of the modern world that wrecks our mental and physical health, the way you perceive it makes a profound difference on how it affects you. New studies have shown that those who see stress as being toxic suffered damaging health effects while who saw it as being helpful were able to turn it into a source of energy to push them through their challenges. 
So, next time you feel stressed from whatever trouble you may be facing, remember that it is your friend. You must reframe the sensation and believe that it‚Äôs your body trying to help you. By changing how you processes stress, you can use it to succeed in life. 2. Obstacles Your response to obstacles reveal the kind of man you really are. 
Whatever obstacles you may face in your endeavors, you have two choices: become frustrated and discouraged by it, or see it as an opportunity to grow stronger. Like stress, it‚Äôs the weaker man‚Äôs inclination to view an obstacle as a confirmation of his own helplessness, but you must do better and face up to whatever gets in your way. Use every occasion to grow stronger from your obstacles and if you aren‚Äôt facing enough of them in your life, you need to get out and start doing more things. 
How you deal with obstacle will show your true nature as a man for the world to see. So, don‚Äôt pussy out or moan about what you must overcome; instead, be determined to rise above it. Your honor is at stake. 3. Failures 
Failures are inevitable in life. Although you should always try your best to succeed, you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to fail either. Just as with obstacles, view every instance of failure as an opportunity to learn and adapt. It‚Äôs not failure itself that is bad, but not learning from it or giving up so easily. Remember: winners don‚Äôt quit; they try to do better. 4. Rejection 
Rejection is a specific kind of failure that is often the most painful of them all. It‚Äôs especially difficult because it‚Äôs often unclear whether it was actually your fault or not. I would say that it‚Äôs best to assume full responsibility for all the rejections you face and see what area you can improve to better increase your chance next time. As long as you‚Äôre willing to learn and as long as you‚Äôre willing to try again, you will grow. Master rejections and you‚Äôll be placing yourself far above other men. 5. Physical Discomfort This is why Russians are so tough. 
It‚Äôs well known that the human body is designed to be anti-fragile. Your bones get thicker with every blow and your skin gets tougher with every scrap. Pain and discomfort of all sorts also become more bearable the more you expose yourself to them. The more harshness you endure, the stronger you become over time. But inversely, the more comfortable you are, the softer you turn and the weaker you get. 
One simple method you can implement to become more healthy and energized is to start taking cold showers. The benefits of doing it are many, including: stronger immune system, enhanced mood and energy, better circulation, boost in testosterone level, and so on. If you are having trouble getting started, start by doing just 30 seconds at the end of your usual warm shower and go from there. You want to train yourself until you can comfortably stand under the coldest water for at least five minutes. 6. Fear 
You can‚Äôt really turn fear itself into a positive, but the process of conquering your fears can have a transformative effect on your life. Some of the proudest, most exciting, and memorable moments of my life were when I defied fears by doing a presentation in front of hundreds of people (I had a terrible stage-fright), going rock climbing (I have a terrible fear of heights), and traveling for the first time by myself to a foreign country. 
One thing you can do to completely turn your life around is to do what this man did and make a list of all the fears that you wish to defeat. Write them down in an order from the least fearful to the most and start knocking them down one by one. It‚Äôs impossible not to become a better man once you conquer them all. 7. Anger 
Like fear, anger is not something you can transform into a positive trait (I‚Äôve heard of people ‚Äútransmutating‚Äù their anger to re-channel the energy into other activities, but I‚Äôve never had it work that way). However, it is a good focal point to master your mind to become more stoic. It can also serve as your area of focus if you practice meditation. 
No matter how unpleasant, your anger will teach you a lot about yourself and only if you allow it. It will reveal your weaknesses, insecurities, and any other areas of your life in need of improvement. As one of the most base and primal of human emotions, you shouldn‚Äôt just shirk it as something that is unneeded; instead, make it your friend. 8. Negativity And Pessimism 
For the longest time, I felt guilty about being ‚Äúso negative‚Äù because I was constantly told by everyone else that it was a bad thing. Smile, they said; think positively, they said; your life will improve, they said. I was constantly berated for not being part of the North American positivity cult. It‚Äôs no wonder why people there tend to say that they‚Äôre doing ‚Äúgreat‚Äù even when they‚Äôre feeling like shit (a habit I have yet to fix). 
But in contrary to the long held belief that positive thinking and attitude gives you a better life, studies have shown just the opposite: Forced positivity can actually harm you . For some people (like me) positive thinking backfires and makes things worse. Also, bad-tempered people who are pessimists have been shown to enjoy more successful marriages, be healthier, live longer, be better at negotiating, and more successful overall in life. So, if you‚Äôre a natural grouch like me, it‚Äôs time to embrace who you are and tell the fake-ass, positivity people to shove it. Conclusion 
The road to self-improvement is an ugly and a bumpy one. I honestly can‚Äôt say that I enjoy it. But no matter what, I know that it is a necessary part of being a man. I can‚Äôt imagine myself not trying to be better in spite of all the difficulties. I refuse to live a life of complacency. Some people mock and insult our efforts , but know that their opinions don‚Äôt matter. Lesser men have no say on what it means to live. So, fight on and prosper, for this is your one and only life.";english;2016-11-16T05:08:31.045+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;8 Ways To Forge Strength Through Challenges;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

We have successfully thwarted the globalist‚Äôs plans to ruin America‚Äîwe‚Äôve fought against the big banks, we‚Äôve fought against the Satanic pedophile Elites , and we‚Äôve fought against the corrupt mainstream media.
But, the battle is not over yet. We still have much to do if we wish to make America great again. This will not be an easy fight, for we will certainly face much resistance along the way. Expect the cucks and liberals to throw temper tantrums as their safe spaces come tumbling down, expect the mainstream media to demonize the alt-right, and expect the elites to do everything they can to stop us.
They will not stop us, though‚Äîno, we are far too powerful. The wheels of truth do in fact turn slowly, but alas, they turn! And they are growing in speed as we blaze towards victory. Here are four goals that we must achieve on our path to victory.
1. Dismantle The Mainstream Media 
As more and more of us start to wake up, the media will begin to sense this‚Äîin fact, they already have. Have you wondered why they‚Äôve started to cover anti-Hillary stories? It‚Äôs because they realize that they‚Äôre losing credibility.
The mainstream media is very well aware that they‚Äôre losing their chokehold on the American public‚Äôs mind, so in a last ditch effort, they‚Äôre trying to seem unbiased. Do not buy into their lies‚Äîit‚Äôs all a giant farce; an attempt to regain their former credibility.
Over the next four years, it will be extremely important to start dismantling these outlets. It‚Äôs time to call them out for what they are. Start sharing alt-right stories on Facebook and Twitter, get our message out there. Don‚Äôt watch any mainstream media.
Don‚Äôt buy mainstream magazines, don‚Äôt watch their news shows, hell, don‚Äôt even pay for cable. Do everything you can to bleed their pockets dry.
As more and more money moves away from the mainstream media, it will naturally move towards alternative news sources‚Äîsites like Return Of Kings, Info Wars, Matt Forney , and Danger and Play will become the new media.
Don‚Äôt expect this to happen at first, however. In one final cry, before its gory death, the media will proclaim that there is a new ‚Äúracist, xenophobic‚Äù enemy that helped Donald get into office: the alt-right.
Expect them to demonize us. Expect them to lie about us, to scream and shout, and to protest. This is fine, however‚Äîfor we are anti-fragile. The alt-right is in a very unique position.
Any and all hatred towards the alt-right will be a net win for us. Why? It‚Äôs simple: any publicity is good publicity. A single mention of an alternative news site by the MSM can, and often does, net us tens of thousands of new viewers.
In other words: if they ignore us, we continue to grow in power. If they attack us, we grow even faster. They can‚Äôt win.
2. Drain The Swamp 
Everything that we‚Äôve done up to this point to get Donald in office will be completely pointless if we don‚Äôt drain the swamp. This is our one chance‚Äîwe have four years to do this.
In order for us to bring about permanent change in this country, we need to hold the cucks and libtards accountable for their actions. Anyone who pushed the pro-Islam agenda, rape culture, or feminazi philosophy must be called out for the traitors that they are.
The elites, the corrupt bankers, and the globalists must all be brought to light. In order for us to bring about true change, and to prevent a globalist dictatorship from happening in the near future, we must ensure that at least 25% of Americans are aware of the elites‚Äô ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù by the next election.
This is a grass roots movement, and it is growing in power‚Äîbut we must take away power from those who tried so hard to fight us. Now is the time to cause a ruckus and email your representatives. Now is the time to demand Hillary be thrown in prison.
Every single person involved in Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server must be thrown in jail. Pedophiles and Satanists such as Anthony Weiner and Marina Abramovic, and traitors such as Huma Abedin and Comey must be thrown in jail for their crimes.
Now is the time to clear out the murky waters‚Äîto sift through the dirt and rotten garbage lurking below. I believe, that once all is said and done, America will enter into a new age of prosperity. The patriarchy will return.
3. Normalize Straight Males 
For too long have men been oppressed, by the very civilization which we created. We have let the SJW‚Äôs and culture warriors back us into a corner, but we‚Äôve finally started to fight back.
More and more men, upon being exposed to the manosphere, are starting to wake up and take the red pill . We‚Äôre starting to realize, as a nation, that there is no reason to be ashamed of being white or being a man.
Once we start to dismantle the mainstream media and drain the swamp, most of this should happen naturally‚Äîit was only through the artificial social engineering that being a white male became a crime.
But, we can‚Äôt stop here‚Äîit‚Äôs time to start slowly red-pilling our blue-pilled friends. The best way to do this, is simply through osmosis. Don‚Äôt try to convince them with logic, because they did not arrive at a blue-pilled position through logic. They did so through emotion.
Simply be a beacon of masculinity. Be confident in yourself, be assertive, and don‚Äôt cave into ridiculous HR requests or political correctness social pressures. Again, once the mainstream media is dismantled and the manosphere grows in popularity, our movement will gain strength exponentially.
The normalization of males, especially white males, is essential for our culture to continue‚Äîthe second that we started to become ashamed of our heritage and of our nationality was the second that the cucks started closing in. We cannot give them an inch, or they will take a mile.
This is not to say that our country shouldn‚Äôt accept immigrants‚ÄîIF they go through the legal process. How did it get so far that it became socially unacceptable to shame ILLEGAL immigrants? Again, ILLEGAL immigrants? Like I said, it got this way due to an overwhelming amount of white guilt. Do not be ashamed of your heritage, men.
We have made a gigantic step towards national sovereignty with Donald Trump being elected as president, and we cannot let this victory go in vain. We must push onward and continue to normalize what is NORMAL. Being a straight male, white or note, should be the norm, not being a transgender, green-haired, SJW.
4. Get The Law On Our Side 
As our grass roots movement picks up more and more steam, I believe that the pressure we create will naturally push judges and lawmakers to change our corrupt legal system.
First things first, we must create laws that treat men and women as they should be treated. Too many laws are skewed in favor of women. Now that women have the right to work, we must remove alimony‚Äîit‚Äôs ridiculous that men should have to pay $10,000 a month to their ex-wives, because she ‚Äúgot used to‚Äù a certain living situation.
We must remove corrupt anti-male divorce laws, ridiculous ‚Äúhate-speech‚Äù laws which infringe on our freedom of speech, and ultimately, SJW ‚Äúrape‚Äù laws.
I, along with many other ROK men, have been falsely accused of rape . It‚Äôs time to remove all of these ridiculous laws that make it illegal for men to simply talk to women, and that were built into the system by the elites in order to wage war against men.
The law should encourage freedom of speech; the fact that Twitter has not been held accountable for banning Milo Yiannopoulos is absolutely absurd. Information and social media platforms should be held to the same standards that the American people are.
Google needs to stop censoring search results‚Äîand if they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs time for us to create laws against this type of behavior. Allowing Google to filter search results is like a regression back to Medieval times. For one entity to selectively edit our version of reality is unacceptable.
Most importantly, judges and lawmakers that have taken bribes should be thrown in jail‚Ä¶indefinitely. Anyone who took a ‚Äúdonation‚Äù from George Soros or any other member of the Bilderberg group should be imprisoned for crimes of treason.
Summary 
We are on the path towards victory, men‚Äîbut it will not be without many hiccups. The first thing that the mainstream media will do is demonize the alt-right, but again, this will only make us stronger. It will expose our view points to a larger audience.
Expect it to get darker just before the dawn. Expect feminists, SJW‚Äôs, cucks, and libtards to protest and scream and shout‚Äîbut, it will all be in vain. Too many men are starting to wake up. Too many men are starting to see the lies that have been shoved down our throats , and there is no going back.
The next four years will be more important than ever. Our primary objective is to dismantle the mainstream media through natural means. It‚Äôs time for them to be exposed as the liars that they are. Simply eliminating the MSM will be most of the battle‚Äîremember, this is a war of information, and when the alt-right starts to control the news, there will be sanity.
We must also focus on draining the swamp. We must rid our corrupt political establishment of the people who‚Äôve betrayed us. We must normalize the family unit and white men‚Äîno longer shall we feel ashamed of our gender or sexual orientation.
Then, from here, the laws must change. Remember: this will not be easy. There will be much resistance along the way, but we‚Äôve come this far. We‚Äôve beat all odds and elected Trump as the president of our nation‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs time to make America great again.

8012;d7ceb99fe83d5bb287303acb208acb45c0755b74;0;Luke Stranahan;2016-11-17T00:39:38.023+02:00;10 Things I Learned From Being My Own General Contractor;"One of the foundations of living a good life in today‚Äôs times is having a good place to call home. Whether you want a solid, comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies, recover from the day‚Äôs tribulations, and just to be, or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits, or both; a good home is essential to the modern man.
I purchased a home and I decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations. My home was an as-originally-furnished home of the 1970s, and I brought its multi-color painted, green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed, hardwood-floored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style. A general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site, source the labor, follow the schedule, get the materials, and execute the vision of the plan. Here are ten things I learned as my own general contractor.
1. There are good contractors, and there are bad contractors 
You will run into both good and bad contractors out there. A good contractor does good work, at good value, follows the schedule, and is honest and doesn‚Äôt lie to you. A bad contractor will do any or all of the above. I fired a contractor who had good value, but did poor work, could not follow the schedule, and lied to me. I paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work, hit the schedule on time, and was a perfectionist. Give a bad contractor a second chance, mainly to see how he corrects it; and, if he fails to shape up, cut him loose.
A good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork, but no more. Some firms I turned down did things by hand and had no contractor‚Äôs license, and that is too little, whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanic‚Äôs lien on your home if you do not pay is too much.
A lot has to do with the presentation of the representative. Tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands, but a man that does not have a good handshake, good eye contact, and is evasive on important details is shady.
2. Good contractors cost more, and they are busy The best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule, and I mean they are booked often a month or so in advance. The guy I fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night, which, while it SEEMS like he‚Äôs busy, he‚Äôs actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs.
A good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them, and he will, when awarded the job, put you in his schedule at an agreed-upon time. My best contractor was so busy that I had to do other things first before I could get his firm to bid my work, and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy; they turned down my work until later.
3. You need to establish a reputation 
General contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they sub-contract to, and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation.
A busy contractor will work with a GC who will give them work in the future over one who will not. I was an unknown, so the busy guys during the busy season (fall and pre-holidays) would pass on me and work with ones they knew.
However, word got around to the others that I gave jobs of good scope, and paid on time. I hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs, and, once they found out who I used as my electrician (it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to), they called and the electricians vouched that I was picky as all hell, but paid on time, and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house. At that point, I was in.
4. Good contractors know other good contractors 
Reputation works the other way too. A good roofer who I only turned down because he was too busy and wouldn‚Äôt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above. Although you should ALWAYS get multiple competing quotes (bid to three, two will generally respond, and pick the better one), the deciding factor was that his brother, the roofer, ran a good shop, and it stood to reason he would, too.
My plumbers knew my AC guys and my chimney guy. My flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys. Everyone works with and around everyone else, and I saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that, on any future projects, I know who to call for what, and, even if I don‚Äôt know, I know who to ask for recommendations.
5. It will take more money than you think it will 
Home renovation is expensive, and it‚Äôs mainly for the nasty reason that, once you commit to action, you can get hit with extra costs. You can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what, but you will find that the home will need things you didn‚Äôt think about, or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted, or materials will simply cost more.
Part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now, and what to spend money on later. Right now, I live in the place (finally), but I still have construction paper down on my floors as I have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas. My bathrooms have plumbing in, but no mirrors, cabinets, towel racks, or toilet paper holders. Entire rooms are without furniture. All of these can, and should, be taken care of later, but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier.
6. It will take more time than you think it will You may not need something this complicated, but a Gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others.
Contractors have their own schedules, and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit, you have to juggle quotes, they have to then write you in, then they do the work, then there‚Äôs follow-ups and punch-lists, and then, finally, that job is done and you pay them.
You can‚Äôt do some other jobs before you finish the first one. This is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters. My floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors, but they did not when they were laying sub-floor, and I was able to have plumbers in that day as well. Contrariwise, I could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done.
7. Some of your ideas are wrong, some are right I had my own thoughts about what to do with the place. Sometimes I was wrong; it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood (even though it was the same color) and I listened to my contractor and used new. Sometimes I was right, my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the counter-tops‚Äô colors, and the ratio of white I wanted was correct, but I was persuaded to add more by my contractor.
Know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent, but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how, instead of the what. I have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures; they did what I wanted, but did it in a better way than I would have suggested, and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process.
8. There will be gaps in your manpower coverage 
The one thing a professional general contractor does that you, as a private operator, will not is do all the basic stuff themselves. A GC will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans, but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself. My electricians did install and hang them for me anyway.
This was for two reasons, and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job. The first is to provide all the materials yourself, which also allows you to pick out what you want. I had a pile of fixtures, fans, and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where, and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done.
The second reason is to provide a good scope of work. Will a plumber come install a single faucet? Maybe. Will he come install five and a garbage disposal? Certainly, that‚Äôs a good day‚Äôs work, so, if you have little jobs, have a LOT of little jobs, and you‚Äôll get more interest.
9. There are things with which you will not be satisfied; good enough is good enough 
This house is old, but renovated. Some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval; I cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is 40 years old and it had popcorn texture on it. Some things I did not address; I have new baseboard and new window trim, but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time.
Some things were done, but were not perfect. The drywall where my kitchen cabinets‚Äô bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where, even after two reworks, still has a hairline paint crack. Some of the window film has pull away lines, and there‚Äôs a couple things trapped under the film in places. One of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue. You cannot have perfection, but you can go for reasonable excellence.
10. Code enforcement sucks The Man sucks. Someone called Code Enforcement on me, and I had to go get a permit of a cost of X% of the renovation‚Äôs cost, mainly so they can jack my taxes up.
I got the permit, and I expect my taxes to go up. The inspector was a real schmuck, as most appointed officials are, but the joke‚Äôs on him, as I only got the permit on what I had left to do and I omitted some things that would still happen, but weren‚Äôt too noticeable.
With code enforcement and county ordinances, the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken, instead of flouting the law. I went and got the permit when I was busted for it, but they only know a third of the story. Had I gotten a permit earlier, perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all. Another tactic, which I will do on a future project I have planned, is to get the permit months ahead of time, then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices.
Conclusion If you have the time, the patience, and the skill to know exactly what you want, who to get for it, and how to juggle a massive schedule, running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational. If you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything, then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead.

Daryush ""Roosh"" Valizadeh created ROK in October 2012. You can visit his blog at RooshV.com or follow him on Twitter and Facebook RSS November 16, 2016 Books 
Written in 1973, The Camp Of The Saints is a novel by Jean Raspail that predicted the European migrant crisis forty years before it began, not only the actual invasion by brown migrants but also the leftist arguments that enabled it, which ushered Europe to its doom. 
The story follows a one-million strong flotilla of Indians who are slowly making their way to Europe. The leaders and people of Europe have decided not to stop their arrival. Light on action, the book focuses on the mood of the pending arrival, particularly how Europeans were eager to cuck themselves into oblivion. 
After all your help‚Äîall the seeds, and drugs, and technology‚Äî[migrants] found it so much simpler just to say, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs my son, here‚Äôs my daughter. Take them. Take me. Take us all to your country.‚Äô And the idea caught on. You thought it was fine. You encouraged it, organized it. But now it‚Äôs too big, now it‚Äôs out of your hands. It‚Äôs a flood. A deluge. And it‚Äôs out of control. [‚Ä¶] 
You‚Äôve gone and worked up a race problem out of whole cloth, right in the heart of the white world, just to destroy it. That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after. You want to destroy our world, our whole way of life. 
Raspail understood how the media whips the public into feeling immense guilt as a mechanism to introduce non-white migrants. Well before the globalist view on migration and equality was elucidated, Raspail was steps ahead in predicting what the result of it would be, as if he was reading into a crystal ball. He even knew that migrants would bring diseases like tuberculosis . 
And all at once whole sections of New York are deserted, a score of American cities watch the flight to the suburbs‚Äîand half the historic Paris pavement too‚ÄîAmerican tots in their integrated schools fall five years behind, tubercular Gauls flee in droves from our open-air clinics. ‚Ä¶ Tally-ho! Tally-ho! Just listen to that battering ram smash at the southern gate! 
The centuries-long segregation of the first and third-world brought great complacency upon Europe. No one could really get a grasp of what was in store once the third-world reached critical mass and started invading the West. 
‚ÄúI can tell,‚Äù Vilsberg continued, ‚Äúthat you really don‚Äôt believe how serious the situation is. After all, we lived side by side with the Third World, convinced that our hermetic coexistence, our global segregation, would last forever. What a deadly illusion! Now we see that the Third World is a great unbridled mass, obeying only those impulsive urges that well up when millions of hapless wills come together in the grip of despair. 
In a bittersweet scene, one of the prominent media leftists goes out with his wife to celebrate the arrival of the flotilla with joyous Africans. Towards the end of the party, his wife gets brutally raped by them and he eventually dies in sorrow. The horde‚Äôs arrival suddenly awakened all the immigrants already in the country into asserting themselves. They began stealing directly from the native citizens by attacking their ‚Äúwhite privilege.‚Äù 
Now, it‚Äôs a known fact that racism comes in two forms: that practiced by whites‚Äîheinous and inexcusable, whatever its motives‚Äîand that practiced by blacks‚Äî‚Äîquite justified, whatever its excesses, since it‚Äôs merely the expression of a righteous revenge, and it‚Äôs up to the whites to be patient and understanding. 
What drives the maniacal leftist? Raspail believes it‚Äôs a suicide mechanism, likely activated by a human organism void of spirit and with no reason to endure a cosmopolitan existence. Attempting to destroy its host culture is an indirect way of killing itself. 
Whenever the pop tunes would lose their blaring charm, there was nothing left but to let oneself drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of human misery and despair, set to music of sorts, that one refuge of yearning and unfulfilled souls that had learned nothing else. It never occurred to any of them to measure that notion of misery against the past, or against their own well-being. For them it was a drug, and they needed to shoot up a good strong dose to keep themselves going, like addicts and their heroin. The fact that it was often hard to come by close to home made very little difference. Nothing stops an addict when he has to have his fix, and poisons like that are easy to import. There‚Äôs never a lack of pushers. Besides, modern man has always had, tucked away in the back of his mind, that singular longing for total destruction, sole cure for the boredom and anguish that consume him. 
The book even predicted a cucked Catholic Church. Raspail knew that every institution had to be on board with Europe‚Äôs destruction for the third-world invasion to proceed seamlessly. 
I came south like a lot of other priests, father, to hail what I thought would be mankind‚Äôs redemption. To welcome the million Christs on board those ships, who would rise up, reborn, and signal the dawn of a just, new day. 
The European women who welcomed the refugees became whores for them. If you think this is too extreme, consider that European women are getting raped by migrants today but not reporting the crime , yet if a white man so much as brushes past them, he‚Äôs accused of assault . 
She died in Nice, in a whorehouse for Hindus, disgusted with everything in general and herself in particular. At the time, each refugee quarter had its stock of white women, all free for the taking. And perfectly legal. [‚Ä¶] 
Yes, the Third World had started to overflow its banks, and the West was its sewer. 
Raspail even predicted the fact that the media would elevant the interracial couplings of white women and the invaders. We saw something similar recently when the German government sponsored sex workshops for migrants on how to fornicate with German girls. 
Ralph Ginzburg, the famous American publisher, had printed a series of photos in his magazine Eros, which had caused not a little ink to be spilled. They showed an interracial couple‚Äîwhite woman, black man‚Äîin various stages of nude embrace. With a caption that read as follows: ‚ÄúTomorrow these couples will be recognized as the pioneers of an enlightened age, in which prejudice will be dead and the only race will be the human race.‚Äù 
The fleet made landfall in France. The French, impotent to do the right thing to save their country, tripped head first into spreading the welcome mat (they actually competed with each other to see who would be the most welcoming). You can imagine the result when one million wretches made landfall in a country they cared nothing about. The new social justice government that rose forth catered to the invaders more than the French, similar to what we already see in Western European nations. 
In war, the real enemy is always behind the lines. Never in front of you, never among you. Always at your back. That‚Äôs something every soldier knows. In every army, since the world began. And plenty of times they‚Äôve been tempted to turn their backs on the enemy‚Äîthe so-called enemy, that is‚Äîand give it to the real one, once and for all. [‚Ä¶] 
When freedom expands to mean freedom of instinct and social destruction, then freedom is dead. 
The book itself wasn‚Äôt my style of storytelling. Raspail made numerous detours and long-winded soliloquies that took away from the action in favor of creating accurate character portrayals. It‚Äôs more of a mood novel than one that moved forward at an exciting pace. The only flaw is that it didn‚Äôt predict the rise of an alternative media that would sound the alarm bell. Even though an active invasion is taking place today, the anti-migrant side is far stronger than what‚Äôs portrayed in the book. 
The Camp Of The Saints was a prophetic story that showed how the migrants themselves weren‚Äôt the only cause of Europe‚Äôs destruction‚Äîleftists played the largest role in ripping apart the country before their arrival, a fact that many of us already know too well.

At this point in time, the new social media site was geared mostly toward college students and it was uncommon for anyone over the age of 25 to have an account. 
But over the last decade we‚Äôve seen Facebook morph into a $50 billion conglomerate and information kingpin acquiring massive power and wealth from the endless amounts of time users waste scrolling through their news feeds. This beast of a social media platform has gone on to consume the lives of millions, gather nefarious amounts of data, foster unnecessary personal dramas, and often cause more harm than good for its users. 
It would be prudent to take a good hard look at your Facebook experience and ask yourself if it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs actually adding value to your life. Here are five reasons why you should think carefully before using the world‚Äôs largest social media site. 
1. Your Facebook Feed Is A Black Hole Of Completely Worthless Information 
I think it‚Äôs important to create streams of information that add real value to your life. Through platforms such as Twitter, Feedly, and YouTube, I‚Äôve followed writers and content producers that have dedicated their lives to self-improvement, entrepreneurship, higher meaning, and the search for truth. 
So you can probably imagine the stark difference between an intellectually curated Twitter feed and the dumbed-down Facebook community of people you went to high school with that peaked in the 12th grade. 
Log into your Facebook and the most common information you‚Äôll likely find is who got married, who had kids, and who got fat. Scrolling through your Facebook feed is akin to flipping through a more personalized celebrity gossip magazine at the grocery store checkout line. 
Every time I log onto Facebook I‚Äôm immediately reminded why I never log onto Facebook. 
2. It‚Äôs No Longer Useful For Dating 
In college, I gained some value out of the site by using its chat feature to build up attraction with girls in my social circle and get their phone numbers. 
But over the years, most girls have attached the ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù stigma to guys who hit them up via Facebook messenger. 
In addition to that, you don‚Äôt really need a Facebook profile for ‚Äúsocial proof‚Äù as you once did since Instagram is a better social media app for meeting girls . 
3. Forfeiture Of Your Privacy 
Most people have realized by now that the first thing a potential employer will do after interviewing you is look you up on Facebook. They‚Äôre basically searching for any and every reason not to hire you. Lock your account down as best you can with privacy functions. Don‚Äôt let that one drunk picture of you from 5 years ago ruin a potential job offer. 
If that wasn‚Äôt enough, Facebook has a long history of shady activities when it comes to privacy. They‚Äôve already been caught accessing your location without permission. We can only speculate what else they‚Äôve been infringing on.
4. Censorship 
Although Facebook has a right to control the information broadcasted on it‚Äôs platform, that doesn‚Äôt mean they should abuse that right by censoring anything they might find disagreeable or offensive. 
Much like an overbearing parent, Facebook proactively controls the discourse of its children, eagerly censoring content that might rub someone the wrong way. Facebook has so many overreaches that an entire website has been dedicated to documenting their affronts on freedom of opinion. You can probably guess which side of the political spectrum they try to stifle.
5. It Brings Out The Worst In People 
Plenty of time has now passed for in-depth research to come out regarding the long-term effects that too much Facebook can have on a person‚Äôs mental well-being. It gives the illusion that everyone else has it better than you and that your life just isn‚Äôt fair. This is a slippery slope into a victim mindset and blaming others for your circumstances. How oppressed these chronic Facebook users are as they sip lattes from a comfy chair in Starbucks and scroll through their Facebook feeds on the latest Macbook.
I won‚Äôt completely deny the merits of Facebook. If you‚Äôre using it to build a brand or a business then it could be a good investment of your time, simply because so many people actively use it. I‚Äôve also witnessed the joy it brings to older users for connecting with long lost friends they haven‚Äôt seen in decades. 
But the truth is that in many cases, Facebook does cause more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs never a bad idea to cut back on your usage or even just opt out entirely. You may no longer be the first to know about an upcoming dinner party or what Brad and Sarah from freshman year have been up to all these years, but I suspect you might be better off as a person.

It seems that we have to turn towards Russia once more for our recommended daily dose of normal masculinity.
As red pill and cold-blooded as it gets 
‚ÄúBrother‚Äù (‚ÄúBrat‚Äù in Russian) is a 1997 movie directed by Alexey Balabanov. It is seen by many as the one of the greatest gangster movie of all time and changed forever the image of the traditional justice-seeking hero.
It has been a few years at least that I want to share my discovery of this film with our readers. It had a tremendous impact on the way I see the world and the attitude I have towards life. I was convinced of its quality, of the impact it could have on the disciples of the red pill and that a few lines cannot do justice to this giant of Russian cinema culture. It entirely deserves an article of its own.
My brother, the criminal 
Enter Danila Bagrov, played by the stellar Sergey Bodrov, who died at 28, at the peak of his meteor-like career. Many called him the Russian James Dean.
After serving in the bloody war theatre of Chechnya, young veteran Danila returns home, in the sleepy provincial town of Tula.
Needing money and without any solid prospects, he joins his brother Vytia who works as a hitman for the local ‚Äúwell-dressed businessman‚Äù in Saint Petersburg. Being an expert in making rudimentary weapons and with his quick capacity of reaction and frugality, Danila adapts marvelously to his new occupation.
After seeing the risk of a gifted concurrent stealing their livelihood, the city‚Äôs gangsters soon put a price on his head and send a few professionals to tie up this loose end. But even after being betrayed by a mix of greed and cowardice, young Danila Bagrov decides to take on the mob single handedly.
An epitome of the Russian alpha. Hard and unforgiving, sober in words and in behaviour, for whom nothing counts more than the bonds of blood and brotherhood.
To err is human 
His one soft spot is the faith he has in human nature, convinced that if he does good, his fellow man will be virtuous in return. He could not be more wrong, especially with women. He discovers very fast that beta moves like buying them gifts and helping them only brings him trouble or ungratefulness.
What is rare and makes Danila stand out is his loyalty, a cornerstone of the definition of masculinity and a value that progressively vanishes nowadays. His brother will do the unthinkable. But after the storm clears and Danila emerges victorious, he proves once more his quality as a man by being magnanimous and giving him a second chance.
No fancy green screen or politically correct themes 
Brat is good because it is painfully real and does not embellish the lawless chaos that was early post-Soviet Russia. This is how it felt when the Wall came down. Everyone was trying to survive the best way they could.
The odd, low-quality orange filter used in the film reminds us of this period where everything was made from what people could find when the shelves where empty.
You cannot go wrong with a good revenge movie and Danila is an example of bravery. Alone and against all odds, he takes on the mafia that wronged him and will make them pay.
The man says it like it is His analysis of the city and its perverse influence on men is brutally accurate:
Danila: You told me about the city, about its strength. But here, everyone is weak.
Hoffman: The city is a great and terrible force. It sucks the life force out of the strong ‚Äì turns them weak. It takes away your power. And you fell right in the middle of it.
His opinion about the abuse of power and the corrupt elites that would kill mother and father for their own profit and the final victory of truth applies especially well to today‚Äôs political and social context.
American, what‚Äôs your power? Is it really money? My brother says it‚Äôs money. You‚Äôve got lots of money ‚Äì so what?
Truth is a real power. Whoever is right is strong. You cheated on a man and took away his money. Did it make you stronger? No, it did not, ‚Äôcause you are not right, and the person you cheated on is. That means he‚Äôs stronger. Right?
‚ÄúBrother‚Äù also drops lethal truths about women and their ways. After spending all his roubles buying drinks and dope for a young interchangeable skank, she tells Danila:
Kate: Do you have condoms?
Danila: Why?
Kate: ‚ÄòWhy? You really think I will give you back your money? Come here‚Ä¶
Two brothers for two majestic films 
The second volume, simply titled ‚ÄúBrother 2‚Äù, breaks the stereotype that sequels are always awful and is at least as good, if not better than the original.
Same characters are followed but this time, Danila‚Äôs brother in arms has been played by a crooked American businessman, in touch with the Muscovite mafia. They attacked his brothers once more and he will have this time to cross the Atlantic to reclaim what is rightfully his.
Again, the movie is realistic, gritty but has a lighter outlook on life. Whereas in the first volume, the main character showed a sheer hatred for everything that came from America and corrupted his country, the sequel that involves Danila‚Äôs adventures and clueless discovery of American culture often results in hilarious encounters.
Un film qui prend aux tripes 
If the red pill was a religion, Danila Bagrov could be its patron saint. You can watch it legally following this link which includes English subtitles. The firm KinoKompania STV that produced the film decided to release it online, the film being such a household name in Russia and worldwide.
Needless to say that you have watch it in the original Russian. The second opus can also be found online with English subtitles and Russian audio.
Don‚Äôt miss out on these monuments of Russian cinema.

If Hillary had prevailed, the roadmap would have been a grim one, as all of our work would have had to take place underground. Happily, we will be able to work in the open. Here are three ways that we can leverage Trump‚Äôs victory to bring back the patriarchy.
Rule yourself Bruce Wayne is a good role model for traditional men: Urbane, fit, financially independent‚Äîand dangerous.
This may seem obvious, but if we are going to bring back the patriarchy, we have to be men who are worthy of it. A patriarch who relies solely on the fact that he is a man will quickly be overthrown. However, a man who has authority because he has earned it by the way he lives will naturally retain it. Thus, the first step in making progress under a Trump administration is the same as it would have been if Hillary had been elected‚Äîself-improvement.
Self-improvement involves the obvious things: getting in shape, training martial arts, getting rid of addictions, and exercising self-discipline. The process of self-improvement needs to be under-girded with a philosophy of life. For most men, this will involve adopting, and faithfully living, one of the faith-traditions. For others, it may mean adopting stoic philosophy. Whatever it is, it will have to be more substantial than the degenerate, ‚Äúpleasure, wealth, and power at any cost‚Äù morality of our Spirit Cooking elites‚Äîlack of morality got us into this problem in the first place.
Self-improvement also involves moving in the direction of financial independence. Under a Trump administration, this last goal will become easier to achieve. Trump‚Äôs tax plan cuts tax rates across the board. This will especially benefit men who are in the middle class who are trying to generate more income. They will be able to keep their savings so that they can move ahead rather than paying a penalty that keeps them from becoming wealthy.
Trump‚Äôs emphasis on fair trade will also result in more American jobs and unleash unprecedented creativity. The age of Trump will be a great time to start a new business. One word of warning is in order though: Under Trump the US is likely to flourish in a way that hasn‚Äôt happened since the the 1920s. Enjoy the prosperity but don‚Äôt get caught back in the materialism merry-go-round. Our goal is a lifetime of financial independence, not conspicuous consumption.
Financial independence is an important practical consideration because you will need a firm financial foundation for the second step, which is ruling your family.
Rule your family Be the patriarch.
Starting with the boomers, our society rejected the traditional way of life and adopted progressivism. Families got smaller, divorce became more common, promiscuity increased, feminism became the default philosophy for girls, and the remaining vestiges of the patriarchy vanished. Progressivism promised freedom but delivered enslavement to political correctness and globalism.
A Trump administration will do little to reverse the deleterious effects that progressivism has had on the family. At best, the only thing government can do for the family is encourage it financially and provide a safe environment for it. But real change has to come from the bottom up‚Äîfrom men and women who return to tradition. For us, that means finding a traditional woman, or more likely one who can be converted to tradition, getting married, and having lots of children. A Twitter shitlord ( @johnrandom1234 ) drove home this point in a humorous way by suggesting with a four-step ‚ÄúTrump Bump‚Äù starter kit:
Getting married, having children, and raising them to hold to the patriarchy is the long game, but it is the only way we will have long term victory. Without a next generation of traditional men, any ground that we gain under Trump will soon be lost.
Rule society‚Äîbring back the patriarchy Benjamin Franklin is a great example of a man who was serious about his civic duty.
The next thing that we must do is start reclaiming our institutions. Trump has captured the presidency and Republicans control Congress, but many of those Republicans are cucks who will oppose the Trumpian agenda. And our other institutions are still dominated by leftists. Hollywood, the news media, education, and corporations all proclaim the progressive, anti-patriarchy message. If we don‚Äôt take advantage of the current moment, any gains that Trump makes will be quickly rolled-back after he leaves office.
Therefore, we need to start re-engaging with these institutions to shift them towards Patriarchal Nationalism . You can share any ideas you have to do this in the comments. Here, I‚Äôd like to suggest that one institution that needs our participation: the Republican Party. Trump has created many allies within the GOP but the majority of the Party still holds to the cucked ideology of open borders and bad trade deals like NAFTA. The GOP desperately needs like-minded men within its ranks who will help Trump achieve his vision.
Getting involved in your local GOP is easy. You merely have to get in touch with your local party leadership in your district. You don‚Äôt have to run for elected office. Simply volunteer your time in getting local officials elected, voting for delegates, or attending GOP events. Go in with a respectful attitude. A lot of the local GOP leaders are good people who still don‚Äôt understand that the real battle is against globalists. Work for incremental change. And, if you have the disposition required for it, consider running for local office yourself.
One piece of advice: If you do choose to get involved in politics, don‚Äôt get caught up in it. One way we ended up with an ossified and out-of-touch GOP is that people started to hold the globalist neoconservatism with an almost religious fervor. The other trap is to use politics as a way of enriching oneself in the manner of Hillary Clinton. If you do choose to enter the political realm, resolve at the outset to not use it for your own financial gain. Don‚Äôt make politics your life. Think of it strictly as civic duty.
Of course, politics is not everybody‚Äôs cup of tea. The key is to use your gifts, whether that is in movie-making or in running a company, to help create an environment where the patriarchy can flourish.
Conclusion The one thing we must not do in wake of the Trump victory is rest on our laurels. If Hillary had won, we‚Äôd all have a great sense of urgency to protect what little remained of our way of life. Now that Trump is coming into power, the temptation is to relax‚Äîto just let Trump do it all. This temptation must be avoided. We must capitalize on the Trump victory with the same high level of urgency that we would have regarded a Hillary victory. If we don‚Äôt, we run the risk of losing all the ground we have gained.

In barely two months, the Donald will take office, ejecting the Democrats‚Äô coterie of corrupt courtiers and beginning his mission to right America‚Äôs wrongs . But President Trump can‚Äôt do it alone: he needs good, talented people to work under him and carry out the hard work of making America great again.
That‚Äôs where you come in.
The Trump administration is now soliciting people to apply for jobs for when the man himself takes office in January. We are officially calling on all ready and able Return Of Kings readers to submit their applications and take up any job offers. Here‚Äôs why you should consider a job in President Trump‚Äôs administration (beyond obvious reasons such as money and prestige)‚Ä¶
1. It‚Äôll help keep President Trump accountable 
While the media is lying about Trump reneging on his campaign promises, it‚Äôs still a good idea to give the man more reasons to keep his word. By staffing his administration with committed nationalists, we‚Äôll make it easier for President Trump to fulfill his political program, as well as make it more difficult for him to go back on his promises. Remember, it was rank-and-file FBI agents who forced James Comey to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton ; a leader needs loyal men in order to carry out his agenda.
2. You‚Äôll be able to make history 
Given the momentous task of rebuilding America after eight years of Obama‚Äôs perfidy and failure, you almost have a civic duty to help President Trump in his mission. Expecting America to become great again all on its own is delusional; we need to do our part to restore this nation‚Äôs glory. By working with the Trump administration, you‚Äôll have a direct role in reshaping America for years‚Äîpossibly decades‚Äîto come.
3. You‚Äôll help trigger the left 
Despite their massive losses in the election‚Äîbeyond Hillary Clinton‚Äôs defeat, the Democrats now control only a handful of state governments and failed to dent the GOP‚Äôs Congressional majority‚Äîthe leftist mainstream media is trying to order Trump around and persuade him to staff his administration with the same flacks who filled Bush‚Äôs and Obama‚Äôs. Right now, they‚Äôre freaking out over Breitbart executive chairman Stephen Bannon being appointed as Trump‚Äôs chief strategist .
By joining the Trump administration, you‚Äôll have a hand in helping trigger the left into conniption fits and spasms of impotence. Nothing horrifies them more than losing access to the levers of power, which they‚Äôve controlled for decades. Watching leftists squirm and cry is one of the biggest fringe benefits of Trump‚Äôs victory, and we need to keep the triggering up for years to come.
If you think you have the job skills, Return Of Kings highly recommends you apply for a job in Trump‚Äôs administration . President Trump may have started the fire, but it‚Äôs our job to help the fire rise.

8019;5d1d650db943583d0cc0114a2e9eb38807f74876;0;William Adams;2016-11-18T20:01:15.594+02:00;What Modern South Korea Is Like;"Over the last decades, South Korea has emerged as one of the wealthiest countries in all of Asia. Currently the OECD country is roughly on the same material and economic level as other affluent East Asian nations such as Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. However, it appears now as perhaps the most potentially strong among them. South Korea seems more dynamic and willful than its larger neighbor and economic main rival, Japan, which perhaps has entered the path of a more long-term decline.
In this article I do briefly describe the main characteristics of contemporary South Korea, and also reflect upon various cultural sub-topics which are of importance for any male who is interested in to obtain more sophisticated knowledge about non-Western cultures and what they might and might not offer.
The emergence of modern South Korea Culturally, politically, technologically and economically, South Korean development during the 20th century onward cannot be understood without to mention the strong ties to Japan and the United States. As much as Japan suppressed Korea between 1910-1945, the material progression is nevertheless a direct and indirect consequence of the traumatic colonial period. Korean leaders were also inspired by the Japanese military dictatorship (which in turn was influenced by European militarism). After South Korea‚Äîwhich was formed in 1945 after the divide of the country‚Äîstopped relying on American aid and focused on its own potential, the economy grew rapidly due to an effective export-oriented industrialization.
Democracy was gradually introduced in 1987 but some of these authoritarian residues are still visible in today‚Äôs society, the military in particular, but also with regard to how many companies are run.
Presently the economic-political relationships between South Korea and Japan remain flexible and pragmatic, for the sake of both countries. The ties to the US seems less problematic, although Koreans negotiate between on one hand a more distinguished Korean culture and on the other further Western influences.
Additional ambivalence might also be a result of that some Koreans regard American relations as a hinder in the process of a future reunification between the two Korean nations. Generally, though, the political, military and economic cooperation between South Korea and the US appears fruitful and to the benefit of both sides.
The Korean wave and the rising appeal of South Korea 
For quite a long time, modern South Korea may be regarded as not much more than a smaller version of Japan, although with a unique language and some other differentiating characteristics. In post-millennial times, however, this picture has gradually shifted‚Äîboth among other Asians, Westerners, and people in other continents too‚Äîtowards a more appealing national image.
The reason for this is mainly material, related to a refined development of technology (Samsung), pop music (K-pop), TV dramas (K-drama), cosmetic products (K-beauty), and perhaps also a more exciting metropolitan nightlife and a better ranked top university (Seoul National University). The Korean wave, Hallyu, covers a whole plethora of different expressions of the rising popularity of South Korean products and celebrities and it has had spill-over effects for other sectors such as academia and tourism. For instance, more people are interested in learning Korean than 10 or 20 years ago.
The nightlife in the capital, Seoul, is unhesitatingly of very high standard. For instance, this year Dj Mag ranks Club Octagon in Gangnam as the fifth best night club in the entire world . In the city regions Gangnam, Hongdae and Itaewon in particular, both foreigners and locals can easily find bars and clubs of various sizes that offer high-quality entertainment and which conform to a relatively broad spectrum of tastes in music and dress style.
Cultural characteristics Contempory South Korean culture can be described as a hybrid of Korean, East Asian and Western culture. As I have stated above, South Korea has been influenced by Japan and the US in particular to a significant extent. This means that the similar, real or quasi-hierarchical structures as in for instance China and Japan are visible in South Korea too. One is expected to speak and behave in different ways, depending on a person‚Äôs age or social rank (which are more or less explicitly stated).
This does largely overlap a meritocratic social structure, rather than status being a primarily inherited factor. A doctor is looked upon as socially more valuable than a regular office worker, regardless of family background. It is thus not much left of the old Confucian system.
The Korean language‚Äîeven though about 60% of the words are based on Chinese words, and its grammar being partly similar to Japanese‚Äîis unique with all its different suffixes that in turn conform to different speech and writing levels. These can be more or less formal, plain and polite but are always related to the social relations and contexts of either speaking or writing. People who know each other well tend to use an intimate speech style (Hae-che), but in some contexts, such as the workplace, they might change to a more formal and polite level (Haeyo-che) when they walk to other people. Many who learn Korean at a beginner‚Äôs level start with Haeyo-che and then gradually broaden the scope to include other levels of speaking and writing.
Apart from the Korean language, a foreigner may find many things in South Korea that are either similar to places such as Japan and Hong Kong, or to the Western world. South Korea, especially Seoul, is largely the product of globalization and as a wealthy country this goes along with high standards of infrastructure and general quality of life. As a high-tech nation it appears as being in the forefront of material development, often outshining its Western counterparts, at least in some ways.
The present culture, especially the more youth-oriented culture, is safe and relaxed. Only slight modifications in dress and behavior (towards more politeness and moderation) makes any Westerner fit in well, at least short term-wise, and to only speak English is seldom a real obstacle.
If a person digs deeper into Korean history and culture‚Äîand geographically move outside the Seoul metropolitan area‚Äîone may find many differentiating and even somewhat unique characteristics (although these do often have China as its root or point of departure), but apart from Buddhism‚Äîwhich is separated rather than integrated into the larger society‚Äîthese elements are seldom manifested in present time. There are obviously many real Buddhists and Christians in present South Korea, but the traditional layers of culture tend to be mere relics of the past. With that said, the country as a whole is overall more socially conservative than many Western counterparts.
Whether or not the trend towards increased westernization will continue remains an open question, but in terms of technology and popular culture it is unlikely that South Korea will look in other directions in the near future. After all, much of its present infrastructure and popular culture makes it into pretty much a local version of the Western-global society.
Lastly, two other things that have direct implications for any foreign person who reflects upon the option to stay longer in South Korea than as a tourist, temporary employee or exchange student, is that 1) the population is very homogeneous, and 2) it has no explicit will to change this fact.
This means that it is difficult, although not totally impossible, to obtain a citizenship if you are not of Korean descent. South Korea uses a type of partial jas sanguinis , citizenship by the blood. It is not very uncommon these days that Korean men get married to and have children with for instance Southeast Asian women, such as Filipinas, and South Korea is gradually shifting towards a more multi-ethnic society. However, compared to many Western countries the levels of ethnic and genetic heterogeneity are much, much smaller.
Due to the legal difficulties and cultural differences, especially language-wise, it is definitely not a smooth process to become naturalized as a Korean citizen or resident. Permanent and temporary living are generally two very different things and South Korea is yet another palpable manifestation of that.
Women in South Korea Phenotypically, South Korean women are similar to those of other East Asian populations. As a result of drastically improved nutrition, younger South Koreans are relatively tall, seemingly not much shorter on average than their Western counterparts. The levels of obesity are slightly rising but still very low compared to the US, Canada and even thinner European countries such as Italy and Sweden. Overall, Korean females‚Äîespecially girls‚Äîcan be characterized as moderately tall and slim.
Additionally, a significant share cares a lot about their appearances. Fashion, diet, hair style and make-up are all very important in everyday life, and although these things change rapidly due to new trends and seasonal shifts, many will ride along the same wave wherever it goes. Collectivism is quite striking in that respect, and sub-cultures are not as widespread and visible as in Japan. Many look about the same.
As with many phenomena in life, the extent to which a person likes or dislikes how a population generally appears is related to individual taste. With that said, I think that more objectively speaking the two main strengths of Korean girls and younger women are that they are relatively thin and well-groomed. They do everything they can to optimize their beauty potentials, sometimes even with the help of plastic surgery (which will make them look somewhat more European, which partly is an ideal among East Asian populations).
Additionally‚Äîeven if this stems more from observations and anecdotes than general facts‚Äîthey tend to be more polite and well-educated, in a positive sense, than Western females. This is something they also have in common with other well off Asians, such as Japanese, Taiwanese, and Singaporeans. In the more exciting locations of Seoul, one will find quite many pretty and decent Korean girls, and even though hook-up culture has for good and for bad penetrated the south of the Korean peninsula, a significant share of these females may be looked upon as serious girlfriend material.
Western guys do have a comparative advantage in terms of looks and even sometimes behavior (Korean guys tend to lack the cockiness of Westerners), but these automatic benefits should not be over-emphasized. Many of the things that girls are attracted to, such as confidence, extroversion and good looks are general, close to universal traits. If one is a loser in the West then one will probably be that in the East as well. Conversely, the more alpha males will magnify their results if they have the proper time and opportunity to do so.
Conclusion Overall South Korea is a rather impressive modern society that shares many of the good features with its equally rich neighbors. However, recently it has seemingly surpassed places like Japan and Hong Kong in terms of material development, nightlife and popular culture. For some Western males, between the ages of 20-35, South Korea might offer a valuable opportunity for temporary‚Äîranging from weeks to even years‚Äî and circular migration. Because eventually it is most likely time to go home, regardless if one wishes it or not.

Brown;2016-11-19T21:01:08.943+02:00;Women Only Hate Female Objectification When They Can No Longer Profit From It;"With her Hollywood and silver screen career options all but dried up, former Charmed actress and constantly near-naked attention-seeker Rose McGowan is now a ‚Äúleading‚Äù feminist. As you would expect, this transition occurred after her looks (which never approached those of co-star Alyssa Milano) had well and truly begun to fade. McGowan is not alone in making this spectacular shift. Pamela Anderson and professional SJW Natasha Devon are among a growing crowd of women who rail against ‚Äúsexism‚Äù and ‚Äúobjectification‚Äù after years of trying, often very successfully, to sexualize their youth.
Seeking to cash in on her new-found fame as an unhinged SJW, Rose McGowan launched the ‚ÄúRose Army,‚Äù a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against ‚Äúdomestic violence‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale objectification.‚Äù Full SJW mode is just a button away for her. For instance, she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and, probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity, claimed an X-Men movie poster promoted violence against women .
So now comes the task of reconciling the new Rose McGowan with the old one, whose self-objectification is best described by this infamous photo with ex-boyfriend Marilyn Manson:
Excuses, excuses‚Ä¶ Rose McGowan has tried to gloss over her past history of self-objectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy.
McGowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds, such as with a fellow Charmed actress, Shannen Doherty, on patriarchy, sexism and female objectification . Sadly, this very public attention-seeking, in which McGowan wrote Doherty an open letter, comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer . But, you know, a girl‚Äôs gotta attention-whore, including when another girl she used to have cat-fights with is about to die.
Rose McGowan has a lot in common with Pamela Anderson. Ex- Playboy cover model Anderson, after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship, has now come out against pornography . She may not be bad for a gal nearing 50, but her best years are a good 20-25 years behind her. I would wager that Pamela Anderson hit 45 and spent the last several years in denial, before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her. Pornography addictions are bad, but Anderson showing these new colors in 2016 is nothing short of a joke.
Anderson‚Äôs position can be summed up by the following two pictures:
Time when she did not condemn pornography: 
Time when she condemns pornography: 
Previously, a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists. These activists are nominally against the sexualization of women, but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish society‚Äôs praise of attractive females. Whilst there is a lot of truth to this, it only tells part of the story. The rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle. And what better time to turn on these industries, whether they be the pornography, film, or modeling markets, than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them?
This phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization . Attractive tennis players like Sabine Lisicki (and unattractive ones like Serena Williams) have made careers out of wearing revealing on-court clothing, which is much more for show than practicality. But when the chance presents itself, Lisicki and others have moaned, like at this year‚Äôs Wimbledon , about how manufacturers‚Äô designs make them show too much skin. Many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet, but they pick and choose when objectification is bad, just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them.
It‚Äôs not just famous people Natasha Devon.
Many Return Of Kings readers will remember Natasha Devon from her awful performance against Milo Yiannopoulos during a British Sky News debate on fashion mannequins. There seems to have been an eerie timing in Devon‚Äôs transition from self-described former model to SJW. She founded a so-called body image education program in 2006, in her mid-twenties. I don‚Äôt know about you, but this seems to be the sort of age when non-famous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger, fresher girls.
As she hurtled towards 30, Natasha Devon penned an article for Cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia, which morphed into a regular monthly column. Then came ‚ÄúThe Self-Esteem Team‚Äù Devon created in 2012. Frequently with government funding, ‚ÄúThe Self-Esteem Team‚Äù has essentially applauded obesity, Britain‚Äôs number one health crisis, and sought to re-engineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive.
Devon, along with Anderson and McGowan, may chalk an anti-objectification epiphany down to age, experience or something similarly convenient, but the changes happened neither at the height of their self-sexualization careers nor during the pre-wall protracted slide. Always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general SJW activism.
When a woman complains about the ‚Äúobjectification of women,‚Äù it usually means a) she never had the goods to begin with, b) her goods weren‚Äôt enough to compete with other girls, or c) her goods are well and truly gone. There is a delicious irony to option c), as countless women will milk their looks until nature‚Äìor a half-decade of alcohol or drug-fueled benders‚Äìtakes them away.
Feminism as projection 
It is par for the course in today‚Äôs political climate that our enemies describe us as sad momma‚Äôs boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs. Of anyone, Roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most, all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and Return Of Kings say.
We need to turn this idea of projection against feminists, even more than we have before. Modern-day feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh, uncertain world. For women whose looks are now washed-up, feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to.
Rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil, it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is: desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant.

Some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants . Or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect. For me and many other men, we came to support Trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women .
The fight began in 2012 with the Southern Poverty Law Center 
In March 2012, after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites , I was put on a list by the Jewish-operated Southern Poverty Law Center for being a misogynist . I was shaken up by this because I knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths I‚Äôve learned from it put me on a path of no return. Either I close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door.
I decided to keep going. I responded to the SPLC designation with an article titled My Existence Is Becoming Illegal , where I described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it.
It is clear that gender hate is now a one-way street. Men can hate women but not the other way around. Men can rape, women can‚Äôt. Men can be abusive, both physically and emotionally, but women can‚Äôt. Men can be misogynist, but women can‚Äôt be misandrist, a word that is unknown to most of the American population. Men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day, but women are perfect as-is in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful. Male teachers get sent to pound-me-in-the-ass prison if they have sex with a student, but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist. If you‚Äôre a man, you‚Äôre likely a perpetrator of hate, violence, and abuse to innocent American women, even if you don‚Äôt yet realize your thought crime, but never the other way around.
Fast forward two years to October 2014. Witch hunts by leftists were in force. Rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists, homophobes, and sexists with the aim of getting them fired. I studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles I‚Äôve ever published: What Is A Social Justice Warrior (SJW) ?
The article was widely shared, influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia, the corporate news media, Hollywood, Fortune 500 companies, Silicon Valley, and the billionaire owners of our politicians. Scratch a feminist SJW and you‚Äôll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes.
I was pessimistic when I wrote the SJW article, thinking we‚Äôd need a full generation (25+ years) to even begin defeating such a powerful anti-American entity . I focused on teaching men self-defense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them. Little did I know that I was defining them at their absolute peak, and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency. The social justice warriors haven‚Äôt gone away, and they are rushing to fulfill the will of George Soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election, but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced, along with the power of the institutions that support them.
Though SJWism peaked in 2014, I had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of 2015 during the Canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in February 2016 during the international meetups . I survived those attacks, and the fact that I‚Äôm still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platforms‚Äîwhile you‚Äôre still here participating‚Äîshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us. They bruised me during the meetup outrage, but I healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs, Donald Trump.
Donald Trump ground zero 
I‚Äôm a pessimist by nature, so I didn‚Äôt have much hope that the establishment would allow Trump to win in the primaries, even though I was confident his ideas resonated with most Americans. But then I noticed that he simply couldn‚Äôt be knocked out, no matter what his enemies did. I saw him humiliate Jeb Bush , out-compete a resurgent Ted Cruz, and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness. By the time I attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , I started to believe.
The ground zero for Donald Trump within the manosphere was The Donald Trump thread on the forum, created in June 2015 by veteran member and ROK contributor Samseau . This is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men. Over 2,000 pages long, the thread has been viewed nearly 6 million times. Ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse, as described here , to men with bullhorns larger than I have.
After significant battles in a real war, medals are awarded but soldiers don‚Äôt nitpick on who was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù soldier. They all worked as a team to ensure victory, from the General (Donald Trump), the Colonels (his advisers), the Captains (major media influencers like Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Paul Joseph Watson, and Mike Cernovich), the Sergeants (men like myself), the Specialists (men like Samseau), and on down to the Private, a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time.
The ego cares about how impactful one is, how influential its ideas are, but the team player only cares about victory for the whole. Whether I am a Private or a Sergeant, I fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourth-generational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future. Who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free open-source software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election, but on the lives of so many men who participated in it.
Approaching the date of the election 
Two months before the election, I did a Youtube video urging men to vote for Trump , and it resulted in nearly 150 unsubscribes within a day, surprising even me since I thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a Trump presidency. The video echoed a lot of sentiments I shared in the article If Donald Trump Doesn‚Äôt Win, We‚Äôre Screwed , where I tried to convey the danger of a Hillary presidency.
Obama was the ‚Äúrace‚Äù president, and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years. Hillary will be the ‚Äúgender‚Äù president. The future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat Trump.
Not only will she move to establish a techno-matriarchy where men are second-class citizens to any female, but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again. This isn‚Äôt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like Twitter or Youtube‚Äîmany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment.
For the next month, I stared at the calendar, waiting for the election to happen, doing what I could to push back against the narrative on Twitter . Then in early October, an old tape was released of Trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they ‚Äúlet‚Äù him. My sister called me, confused, and asked if he really was a bad man. I told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a ‚Äú pro-rape advocate .‚Äù I told her not to believe the media and to judge Trump by his actions and his policies, not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help Hillary‚Äôs failing campaign.
I spoke to her with confidence, but inside I was concerned: in a politically correct world, would this be the blow to sink Trump‚Äôs candidacy? Is the majority of Americans actually ready to defeat political correctness? Thankfully, Trump responded strongly, ignoring calls by the traitors in the Republican party to step down.
The first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that Trump‚Äôs support didn‚Äôt decline. The fake controversy didn‚Äôt work. I held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out, maybe of him saying the n-word, but none did, and I knew the establishment had no more bullets. This was the moment where I finally believed. I felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that Trump was going to win. I did a Periscope that night as if I was amped up on methamphetamine, but I took no drug.
From that point on it was just a matter of hanging on, until finally on November 8 when he was elected President. I was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when I was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against Trump. I didn‚Äôt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom I consider on the same team as us. If I made any miscalculation, it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces. I underestimated our own power, and those of our allies in the alternative internet space.
Human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
The most important lesson I learned from Trump‚Äôs victory is how pointless it is to control human beings, both their behaviors and their minds. Every single major institution in the United States, represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence, could not stop a populist candidate, in spite of trying everything short of assassination.
George Soros and his billions weren‚Äôt effective. Obama and his allies weren‚Äôt effective. The mainstream media and their dozens of outlets weren‚Äôt effective. CEOs of the biggest companies in the United States weren‚Äôt effective. Hollywood and it‚Äôs superstars weren‚Äôt effective. Academia and it‚Äôs thousands of professors weren‚Äôt effective. Social media and its censorship efforts weren‚Äôt effective. The FBI allowing Hillary to skate from real crimes wasn‚Äôt effective. Even Donald Trump‚Äôs own party wasn‚Äôt effective in stopping him. It‚Äôs absolutely incredible that all these forces couldn‚Äôt stop one man and his believers. What a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably!
Think right now of how much effort the anti-Trump forces put into stopping him from winning. Think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome. And now think how it was all for nothing . They accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish, after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the American public.
Whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existence‚Äînature, God, Tao, or so on‚Äîit is clear that humans cannot control it all, and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing, that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn, and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it. Imagine how impotent George Soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing.
Now they have to perfect their control methods even more, open their pocket books further, and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full. Their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears, of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody, that they are powerful, that the world must be shaped into their image, that they are gods among men, but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money. Much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat, or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled.
You can control human beings, but only temporarily and only some of them. At the end of the day, humans want to do what they want to do, and if you don‚Äôt possess what they wish to buy, they will go to someone who does, no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control. The more you control what does not want to be controlled, the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling, of which we are currently living through. In previous eras, that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets, but in our modern era, it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes.
If you want to be a true leader of society, create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want, can freely engage in commerce, can create families, can live in safety, can search for the truth without interference, and can work and play and live according to their nature. Put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down. It may take a decade, it may take 100 years, but it will happen, and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness.
Conclusion We are tired of being controlled. Leave us alone. We are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us, of forcing us to believe in falsehoods, of programming us to hate our country, of pitting woman against man and black against white. Leave us alone! Let men be men, and from that a new American renaissance will come forth. Men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives, and if you prevent us from doing so, we won‚Äôt allow you to live yours. We will humiliate your useful idiots, we will destroy your institutions, we will lash out with more than just memes.
I‚Äôm afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us, but at least now we have our man in the White House who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years. I can‚Äôt wait to see where this fight takes us next.

A man should always be seeking to improve himself in some fashion, and when he has achieved one goal, he should move onto the next one. In short, never rest on your laurels.
Combining this desire for self improvement with the masculine independence and minimalist lifestyle that other writers on this fine website should inculcate in you a desire to improve yourself while being thrifty and relatively solitary. As this article deals with fitness, you know what I‚Äôm going to say: personal trainers, or at the very least, the ones at your average commercial gym, should be avoided at all costs. And while most long-term fitness enthusiasts and professionals will likely either train by themselves or have one of the few trainers that knows what he‚Äôs doing, most of us have to train alone, especially beginners who have naught but common sense to light his path. But there is another option: books 
Yes, books, that simple yet elegant method of transferring knowledge directly to its viewer. There are certainly plenty of books out there pertaining to the various fields of fitness and athletics. But the question remains: how effective is a book in physical training?
As an avid reader of fitness-related tomes (and many others, but that‚Äôs neither here nor there), I own many of these books. And I feel that their effectiveness can be judged by grouping them based on ‚Äúgenre‚Äù.
Weight Lifting and Calisthenics When I first started getting into physical culture as a young teenager, I turned to the nearby commercial gym, as most tyros tend to. In that commercial gym, I quickly found myself being attached to a well-meaning jackass who gave me a machine-heavy program that, according to him, would ‚Äúdevelop strength, size and endurance.‚Äù And like most naive young men, I followed him, developing none of those things, but lining the trainer‚Äôs pockets.
Eventually, realizing that I had been lied to, I embarked on a search for enlightenment, coming to the various corners of the internet that deal in such interests. One of the first things that I came across were books that I have repeatedly referred to in these pages, and still consider to be some of the best writing on general fitness out there‚Äîthe works of men such as Paul Wade and Pavel Tsatsouline. Upon reading books such as Power to the People and the Convict Condidtioning series, and using a bit of common sense, I deduced that these books were superior than the typical tomes on fitness that the commercial gyms would sell at the counter for a few reasons:
One, they advocated a physical philosophy of simplicity and ‚Äúpurity‚Äù. Rather than advocating a julienne of exercises; their routines were efficient and targeted all muscles of the body. Two, the credentials of the men were a cut above the average writer: as a maximum security convict and a Spetsnaz veteran (respectively), I knew that these men needed to train their muscles to fighting trim for purposes of survival, rather than ‚Äúdoing curls for the girls‚Äù. And third, they referred to the strongmen of old like Maxick and Eugen Sandow, ‚Äústanding on the shoulders of giants‚Äù and opening my eyes to the wider world of fitness writing, much of which I have further consumed.
In general, I would argue that writing on weightlifting and calisthenics are the most effective books on fitness, as these are solitary activities, and the books are typically written by one man speaking to another man. Thus, the techniques there in are written to be easily understood and practiced by the user without a partner.
Martial Arts As I have repeatedly stated on this website , martial arts in general should be taken with a massive grain of salt‚Äîwhile I‚Äôm not so stupid as to say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no point in training any sort of refined fighting style because of adrenaline‚Äù (and yes I have seen this boneheaded argument made), I have also spent a substantial amount of time debunking the overly flowery and outright fictitious martial arts styles that many hack authors and film-makers propagate, on my own website as well as my Youtube and Dailymotion channels. Sadly, thanks to martial arts being more or less an unregulated market in the United States, any clown has the full legal right to proclaim himself a ‚Äúmaster‚Äù.
With that being said, some martial arts books are effective, thoroughly explaining the proper mechanics of a move and/or explaining proper situations in how to use them. While I have a background in ‚Äúproper‚Äù study, I have also utilized books to teach aspects of martial arts that I was not formally taught‚Äîsuch as grappling. And again, I sought out accomplished and legitimate fighters that were decorated in their field: men like Farmer Burns ( Lessons in Catch Wrestling and Physical Culture ) and Masao Takahashi ( Mastering Judo ) wrote detailed and efficient books for fighting ‚Äúin the clinch‚Äù, and I have also used Dr. Sang Kim‚Äôs books on Taekwondo such as Complete Kicking for learning some of the more exotic kicks that my own background didn‚Äôt teach me. And of course I practiced on resisting opponents, some of whom had been wrestlers themselves and thus could shore up my technique.
The most important thing to bear in mind when using a martial arts book is that you MUST practice these techniques against a bag/dummy at the VERY least, and preferably with a sparring partner that will put up a fight. And while this is also the case for any book on physical culture, I would argue that it‚Äôs the most important for martial arts‚Äînamely because martial arts techniques are, by definition, used in panic situations. In contrast, weightlifting is almost always done in a state of relative calmness‚Äînot counting the fake screaming idiots use to ‚Äúpump themselves up‚Äù.
Mindset/Meditation/Etc Books such as the Kundalini Meditation Manual by Yogi Bhajan, which I have only recently started to use, are simultaneously the most simple and most complicated books on self-improvement to use. They are simple because in very basic terms the advice they give is basically ‚Äúthink really hard about something‚Äù, but it is precisely that abstractness that can make them difficult-meditation is a nebulous concept for the best of us to grasp immediately, and in some ways changing one‚Äôs mindset and behavior is the most difficult thing anybody can do.
While I admittedly do not have the depth of knowledge in these that I do with the other two topics, I would say that these are hard to grasp but easy to practice once they have been ‚Äúgrokked‚Äù in the words of Anthony Burgess: After all, every second of every day of your life will involve you utilizing your mindset. And thus, its difficulty lies in the original understanding.
Conclusion Looking at these three broad ‚Äúgenres‚Äù of male self-improvement books, we can see that they differ greatly in content, but, speaking from a position of experience, I can safely say that to a great extent they are effective, and they can teach you new things, but only if you get one of the relatively few books that aren‚Äôt written by armchair alpha males, and only if you diligently practice the information contained within them.

What happens when a woman doesn‚Äôt want a baby? She aborts it. She can go to the doctor for a minor procedure that inconveniences her for a day. The man who impregnated her has no legal right to prevent her from doing so. 
What happens when a man doesn‚Äôt want a baby? Assuming the woman wants to keep it, he is ordered by a court to provide payments. If he chooses not to, money will be automatically garnished from his salary. If garnishment is not an option, he is sent to prison . 
A woman can kill life and she is empowered while receiving no interference from the state. A man can choose to merely ignore life and he can be imprisoned, his life ruined.

The most abused word in the English language is ‚Äúneed.‚Äù If you‚Äôre reading this post, I contend there is little that you actually ‚Äúneed‚Äù beyond what you currently possess. You have ample electricity to power your computer in a climate-controlled environment, with running water and food in your well-stocked refrigerator. Why, then, do you always hear people talking about how they ‚Äúneed‚Äù more stuff? 
Humans have a deeply-rooted drive to compete with each other, and advertisers capitalize on this impulse. Take a moment to picture the average person that you meet. What do they have to take pride in? Buying the newest thing allows them to join the club of consumers, and for a fleeting moment to be measured on an equal playing field despite their personal shortcomings. The internal pain of their life‚Äôs problems dissipates for the split second they can boast superiority over everyone who doesn‚Äôt have the same shiny widget. 
This conspicuous consumption creates a self-fulfilling ego-investment in the broken system. Although borrowing money for useless luxury purchases subjugates people into debt slavery, the mentality is ‚ÄúIf I paid $30,000 for this hunk of metal and I‚Äôm working overtime to pay it off, it MUST be worth it ‚Äî and so are other things that the commercials are telling me to buy.‚Äù Quite literally, we are working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don‚Äôt need . 
If you‚Äôre reading this blog, you are likely a male aged 25-35 who wants to do one or more of the following: quit your job, travel, explore a location-independent income, get yourself in shape, take charge of a relationship, and learn valuable life skills. A minimalist mentality helps you do all of these things. 
Having fewer possessions forces you to properly place a higher value on experiences. This will make it safer and more fulfilling to travel because you are in touch with what truly makes you happy. If you‚Äôre working on a side hustle or starting a business, the desire for needless possessions drains your disposable income levels and prevents you from taking risks. ‚ÄúIf my business fails, will I have to give up my car lease?‚Äù Preempt this loss aversion by having less to lose. 
If you want to move to a better city with a higher cost of living, having excess stuff sets a floor on how much rent you‚Äôll pay to house your crap, and in turn how much you can spend on leisure activities. If you‚Äôre a distractable person like me, removing visual ‚Äúnoise‚Äù from your area makes you more likely to create things with your mind, and less likely to fixate on your environment . 
Throwing or giving useless things away is a good first step, since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them. To fully embrace this mindset, you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth. Cut down on your ‚Äúconsumer impressions‚Äù by watching less TV and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter. Find fulfillment in hobbies and work, rather than chasing the rush and eventual hedonic adaptation from consuming. Much like a drug, successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no different, but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down. 
Girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor. Ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living space, she beings to tell you that you ‚Äúneed‚Äù a new this, or a replacement that? A good friend once told me ‚ÄúAll human beings have an innate desire to create ‚Äî most women can‚Äôt, so they redecorate.‚Äù Limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism. Ironically, men likely to lead a minimalist/nomadic lifestyle are simply more attractive to prime-SMV women. Think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass. As always, watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change. 
Ask yourself this: If your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your back, what would you be worth to society and to yourself? How would you feel about losing all of the possessions you own? Most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing Aunt Gladys‚Äôs vase or baby pictures they haven‚Äôt looked at in a decade. This is an illusion. Once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to ‚Äústuff‚Äù you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences. 
Minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness. I don‚Äôt wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day ‚Äî I simply choose to allocate my money to experiences (and a few possessions) that will fulfill me and advance my life‚Äôs purpose, rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere. 
Taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you. I don‚Äôt promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody happy, but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of self, and will allow you to focus on the internal and external traits that exemplify a man of value.";english;2016-11-21T01:47:36.565+02:00;returnofkings.com;US;25945.0;Comment on Why You Should Become a Minimalist by How Effective Are Books On Fitness?;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;hate

It is composed of very fallible human beings who make mistakes with the same regularity as all the rest of us. I was recently reading a bit about something in statistics called ‚ÄúGalton‚Äôs Problem,‚Äù an observational dynamic named after its discoverer, Sir Francis Galton.
To state it very crudely, Galton‚Äôs Problem is a situation resulting when observers assume that certain things are separate and discrete, when in fact they are not. For example, those who failed to predict Donald Trump‚Äôs electoral victory assumed that social conditions in the United States were isolated from those of the rest of the world. Such people failed to notice the evidence of widespread public anger in many other countries, most notably England, Italy, France, and Hungary.
Sir Francis Galton
Failure to take into consideration the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù is still forgivable, of course; no one can be right all the time, or even most of the time. Systems in the modern world suffer from too much input and data, rather than too little. But deliberate lying is quite another matter. And it is undeniable that some mainstream media outlets have deliberately sought to conceal the truth on a variety of domestic and foreign issues. Rather than act as a check on governmental power, the media has actually become an arm of government power, enforcing doctrinal orthodoxy with a variety of carrots and sticks that have proven to be reasonably effective.
Individual journalists can play significant roles in this process. Consider a favorite example of mine, the case of famed baseball player Ty Cobb. I‚Äôve been an admirer of Cobb for a very long time, ever since reading his autobiography as a boy. Something never quite felt true about all those stories that other biographers would tell about him. The worst of these was sports writer Al Stump, whose biography of Cobb has now been discredited as mostly fabrication.
Stump was granted exclusive access to Ty Cobb in 1960 and 1961 for his biographical purposes. Cobb shared with him many intimate details of his life and career; but instead of faithfully reproducing those recollections, Stump embellished, slanted, and outright fabricated numerous anecdotes designed to cast Cobb in the worst possible light. Stump portrayed Cobb as a southern racist (Cobb was from Georgia), a misogynist, and even a murderer. Cobb was not alive at the time all these stories began to circulate and was unable to defend himself.
To add insult to injury, Stump‚Äôs writings were used as the basis for a terrible 1994 film called Cobb, which starred Tommy Lee Jones. The film is a tissue of lies and distortions that deserved to‚Äîand did‚Äîflop at the box office. The real Ty Cobb was a complex, driven, and highly intelligent figure, who knew how to court controversy when he had to, but was actually a gentleman by the standards of the era. Readers interested in further reading should consult the wonderful biography by Charles Leerhsen entitled Ty Cobb: A Terrible Beauty .
A famous photo of Cobb stealing third base
To begin with, Cobb used brains rather than brawn to beat his opponents. He made careful studies of all the top players of his day and crafted strategies designed to exploit their weaknesses. For example, when he learned that pitcher Walter Johnson hated hitting batters with pitches, Cobb would crowd the plate to force Johnson to walk him. He learned how to get inside the heads of his adversaries, forcing them to lose their tempers; when they did, Cobb would steal bases right under their noses. He remains one of the few players in history who knew how to steal home base.
One legend about Cobb that has persisted is that he was a violent brawler. This is simply not true. It is true that men of his era got into fistfights often‚Äîit was part of a healthy masculine culture back then‚Äîbut he never gratuitously assaulted or struck anyone. The few incidents that have been held out as examples of his misbehavior (e.g., a fight with a black groundskeeper and assorted hotel brawls) prove to be on closer inspection nothing more than the standard types of fights that physically-minded men like him became entangled with. Nearly all ballplayers of his era engaged in them, including Babe Ruth.
Al Stump‚Äôs character assassination of Cobb went even further, painting him as an unreconstructed southern ‚Äúracist‚Äù who had a grudge against blacks. This is completely false. Cobb was actually one of the few early supporters of integration in the big leagues. When asked his opinion about subject by the Sporting News in 1952, he said, ‚ÄúThe negro has the right to compete in sports, and who is to say he has not?‚Äù
He had nothing but compliments for black athletes like Willie Mays and Jackie Robinson, and players in the Negro League whom Cobb interacted with in the 1920s confirm that there was no trace of prejudice in Cobb‚Äôs makeup. Cobb mentored younger players, corresponded with fans with personalized letters, and helped found a hospital and a college education fund.
Cobb was certainly no angel, but in hindsight he was nothing more than an aggressive, daring man who played professional sports at a time when things were much less regulated than they are now. Cobb himself may even have allowed spurious tales about himself to circulate in order to court publicity. But he had a limit, and complete fairy tales he would not tolerate.
Stump‚Äôs lies have been so pervasive and persistent that the mythology surrounding Cobb will take decades to undo. If anything, Cobb was too trusting in letting a man like Stump into his confidence. Cobb was so angry with Stump‚Äôs hatchet job that he was preparing to sue to prevent publication of Stump‚Äôs writings in 1961, just before his death. The terrible 1994 film Cobb only added more oil to the fire.
Malicious journalism can do serious damage. Sometimes the damage comes from ignorance, other times from deliberate peddling of falsehood. The motives for lying‚Äîwhether coming from money, fame, or the desire to ‚Äúvirtue signal‚Äù‚Äîcan always be found if one digs below the surface. In the modern era, the default rule must be to seek independent confirmation of news stories, and to remember that journalists are subject to the same human emotions and weaknesses as all the rest of us.

Twitter has suspended multiple accounts, such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Ricky Vaughn, and Matt Forney. The Guardian wrote a hit piece against the red pill . The media has called alt-right groups ‚Äúxenophobic, racist, and misogynist,‚Äù despite not pointing to a single piece of evidence.
As anti-Trump rallies continue to rage across the nation, in New York City, Philadelphia, and Michigan, the media completely ignores all of the assaults occurring on Trump voters:
Despite the elites‚Äô attempts to destroy us, we are, in fact, winning this battle. The reasons why are simple:
Truth is always more powerful than falsehood We are too numerous to be effectively silenced We don‚Äôt congregate on one single platform; we‚Äôre a collection of individuals based around an ideology We‚Äôre high energy, decisive, assertive, and confident men Below, I would like to offer the supporters of our causes some signs of hope. Victory is near, and Trump is going to lead the way.
1. George Soros Being Sued For $550 Million 
According to Breitbart , along with dozens of other alternative news sites, Dallas Police Department Sergeant Demetrick Pennie, President of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation, is suing a multitude of individuals for inciting a race war:
George Soros Hillary Clinton Jesse Jackson Barrack Obama The New Black Panthers ‚Ä¶and more Some individuals might claim that there‚Äôs no way someone can take on this collection of massively powerful and wealthy elites in a single lawsuit, and they may be right. However whether or not this lawsuit is successful, is completely irrelevant.
What matters far more, is that the word is starting to get out there. The President of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation, an extremely reputable organization, is taking steps to file a massive lawsuit against these individuals. This will, at the very least, do several things:
Potentially serve a massive blow to the globalists Show the elites that we will not back down Generate huge amounts of public awareness Show the average gun rights promoting, masculine, traditional American that they have our support. And best of all? The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which means that the outcome will generally be good either way.
First of all, there‚Äôs a very high likelihood of them winning due to the case being handled in Texas, a highly conservative state. Second, in the event that the case doesn‚Äôt win, it will likely be pursued all the way to the Supreme Court. If this occurs, expect truly amazing things to happen. The reason why? The President of the United States is responsible for appointing Supreme Court judges‚Äîand guess who‚Äôs going to be President in two months?
2. The GrubHub Crash 
After Matt Maloney, CEO of the online food delivery service GrubHub, proclaimed in an email that if you agree with Trump‚Äôs politics you should resign, their stock dropped by nearly 10% in just a few days.
Since this time, in addition to his company‚Äôs stock tanking, he has received ample backlash on sites of all manner: from Twitter to Facebook to Reddit to independent blogs to major alt-right news centers.
This is what my fellow ROK contributors and manosphere bloggers were talking about when they mentioned the ‚Äútangible impact‚Äù of Trump voters. Hillary‚Äôs supporters lack the characteristics necessary to make change:
A burning passion and sense of purpose Moral fortitude and a sense of justice Self-confidence, and the courage to stand up for your rights A fucking spine This is why we will win, period. The anti-Trump crowd is based around having a massive entitlement complex, a victim complex, not thinking for yourself, and being a blind social sheep. Do people like this ever have ANY political or financial power in the world?
Of course not! Who do you think all of the hard working businessmen are? All of the entrepreneurs? All of the people investing in the stock market in order to take control of their financial future? Hard working, intelligent men, who don‚Äôt make excuses, obviously. And do you know what? These are the types of men that voted for Donald Trump.
Why do you think the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at an all time high? Because Trump‚Äôs win restored faith in America.
3. Rise of the New Media 
The mainstream media has repeatedly shown to be completely incompetent in regards to actually reporting on the issues; they are nothing more than a puppet show meant to distract, entertain, and brainwash the American public.
They have consistently lied about candidates, manipulated the evidence, falsified facts, skewed statistics and polls, and defamed multiple individuals for a mere political opinion; this will happen no longer.
With the rise of the new media, more and more men have begun establishing outlets across all platforms: Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Periscope, the list goes on and on.
I firmly believe that the next eight years will be looked back on by historians as one of the most important times in all of humanity‚Äôs time on this earth. 
America has brought the world stability; we have stood as a symbol and an ideal for other countries to follow. We are a monolith of free speech, bravery, and economic prosperity‚Äîand the elites have tried to destroy all of this to satisfy their greedy little egos.
The men of America will not have this. Over the past 8 years (*Cough* Obama‚Äôs Presidency *Cough*) we have seen an exponential increase in not only the quantity of alternative news outlets, but also the quality.
Sites that were merely blogs a few years ago have evolved into full-blown news syndicates with live reporting, on-site video footage, and actual news anchors. This is literally the people fighting back; we want freedom of speech, and we will have it.
While the mainstream media draws its final breath, they‚Äôre proclaiming that there‚Äôs this ‚Äúnew, radical white-nationalist group called the alt-right,‚Äù in an attempt to make us look like evil Fascists. In fact, I just had somebody threaten to kill me on Twitter , but was he banned? Of course not.
This repeated favoring of violent, mentally ill leftists makes it very clear what the MSM‚Äôs agenda is‚Äîtotal control and a complete suppression of our freedoms of speech. Sorry, but the alternative media isn‚Äôt going to let this happen.
4. Massive Boycotts of Anti-Trump Companies 
The left‚Äôs hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me. Somehow they can completely legally destroy an independent, family owned business for simply refusing to bake a gay couple a cake, but when Trump supporters simply boycott a multi-billion dollar conglomerate, we‚Äôre the ones that are hateful?
In response to several CEO‚Äôs statements regarding Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúracism,‚Äù and ‚Äúhate,‚Äù the men and women who voted for Donald Trump decided to simply boycott them. Despite this completely legal and anti-violent response, the left is up in arms.
Here is a list of companies whose CEO‚Äôs have been caught attacking Donald Trump and his pro-American policies:
PepsiCo (They own Pepsi, Lays, Mountain Dew, Starbucks, and More) Nabisco (Their brands include Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, and More) Netflix Macy‚Äôs Ben & Jerry‚Äôs Each and every single one of these companies has either spoken out against Trump directly, has refused to do business with Trump, or has moved factory production outside of the US (such as Nabisco, which has started moving production to Mexico). Some companies, such as Ben & Jerry‚Äôs, have even openly supported the terrorist movement Black Lives Matter .
Again, what do these actions signify in Trump supporters? Power. Assertiveness. Courage. A willingness to take action. This is why Donald Trump won‚Äîhis supporters are grown ups, not little babies who want more safe spaces and anti-free speech zones.
When Donald Trump‚Äôs voters get oppressed by the biased, controlled media, or by elite globalists, they don‚Äôt whine or cry about it, they just do something. They protest and stop supporting companies that are shipping our jobs away. They speak out in a logical, rational way against the anger and hatred that the left has towards white men.
They take their lives into their own hands rather than relying on a stupid system that caters to cry babies and whiners. They take their health into their own hands, they take their finances into their own hands, and they take their relationships into their own hands.
They don‚Äôt wait around for someone else to do it for them‚Äîthey get it done themselves. This is why Trump got into office, and this is why we‚Äôre going to make America great again.

Daryush ""Roosh"" Valizadeh created ROK in October 2012. You can visit his blog at RooshV.com or follow him on Twitter and Facebook RSS November 20, 2016 Politics 
Every man who supports Donald Trump came to it from a different path. Some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants . Or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect. For me and many other men, we came to support Trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women . The fight began in 2012 with the Southern Poverty Law Center 
In March 2012, after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites , I was put on a list by the Jewish-operated Southern Poverty Law Center for being a misogynist . I was shaken up by this because I knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths I‚Äôve learned from it put me on a path of no return. Either I close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door. 
I decided to keep going. I responded to the SPLC designation with an article titled My Existence Is Becoming Illegal , where I described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it. 
It is clear that gender hate is now a one-way street. Men can hate women but not the other way around. Men can rape, women can‚Äôt. Men can be abusive, both physically and emotionally, but women can‚Äôt. Men can be misogynist, but women can‚Äôt be misandrist, a word that is unknown to most of the American population. Men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day, but women are perfect as-is in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful. Male teachers get sent to pound-me-in-the-ass prison if they have sex with a student, but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist. If you‚Äôre a man, you‚Äôre likely a perpetrator of hate, violence, and abuse to innocent American women, even if you don‚Äôt yet realize your thought crime, but never the other way around. 
Fast forward two years to October 2014. Witch hunts by leftists were in force. Rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists, homophobes, and sexists with the aim of getting them fired. I studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles I‚Äôve ever published: What Is A Social Justice Warrior (SJW) ? 
The article was widely shared, influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia, the corporate news media, Hollywood, Fortune 500 companies, Silicon Valley, and the billionaire owners of our politicians. Scratch a feminist SJW and you‚Äôll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes. 
I was pessimistic when I wrote the SJW article, thinking we‚Äôd need a full generation (25+ years) to even begin defeating such a powerful anti-American entity . I focused on teaching men self-defense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them. Little did I know that I was defining them at their absolute peak, and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency. The social justice warriors haven‚Äôt gone away, and they are rushing to fulfill the will of George Soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election, but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced, along with the power of the institutions that support them. 
Though SJWism peaked in 2014, I had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of 2015 during the Canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in February 2016 during the international meetups . I survived those attacks, and the fact that I‚Äôm still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platforms‚Äîwhile you‚Äôre still here participating‚Äîshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us. They bruised me during the meetup outrage, but I healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs, Donald Trump. Donald Trump ground zero 
I‚Äôm a pessimist by nature, so I didn‚Äôt have much hope that the establishment would allow Trump to win in the primaries, even though I was confident his ideas resonated with most Americans. But then I noticed that he simply couldn‚Äôt be knocked out, no matter what his enemies did. I saw him humiliate Jeb Bush , out-compete a resurgent Ted Cruz, and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness. By the time I attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , I started to believe. 
The ground zero for Donald Trump within the manosphere was The Donald Trump thread on the forum, created in June 2015 by veteran member and ROK contributor Samseau . This is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men. Over 2,000 pages long, the thread has been viewed nearly 6 million times. Ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse, as described here , to men with bullhorns larger than I have. 
After significant battles in a real war, medals are awarded but soldiers don‚Äôt nitpick on who was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù soldier. They all worked as a team to ensure victory, from the General (Donald Trump), the Colonels (his advisers), the Captains (major media influencers like Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Paul Joseph Watson, and Mike Cernovich), the Sergeants (men like myself), the Specialists (men like Samseau), and on down to the Private, a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time. 
The ego cares about how impactful one is, how influential its ideas are, but the team player only cares about victory for the whole. Whether I am a Private or a Sergeant, I fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourth-generational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future. Who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free open-source software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election, but on the lives of so many men who participated in it. Approaching the date of the election 
Two months before the election, I did a Youtube video urging men to vote for Trump , and it resulted in nearly 150 unsubscribes within a day, surprising even me since I thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a Trump presidency. The video echoed a lot of sentiments I shared in the article If Donald Trump Doesn‚Äôt Win, We‚Äôre Screwed , where I tried to convey the danger of a Hillary presidency. 
Obama was the ‚Äúrace‚Äù president, and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years. Hillary will be the ‚Äúgender‚Äù president. The future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat Trump. 
Not only will she move to establish a techno-matriarchy where men are second-class citizens to any female, but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again. This isn‚Äôt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like Twitter or Youtube‚Äîmany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment. 
For the next month, I stared at the calendar, waiting for the election to happen, doing what I could to push back against the narrative on Twitter . Then in early October, an old tape was released of Trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they ‚Äúlet‚Äù him. My sister called me, confused, and asked if he really was a bad man. I told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a ‚Äú pro-rape advocate .‚Äù I told her not to believe the media and to judge Trump by his actions and his policies, not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help Hillary‚Äôs failing campaign. 
I spoke to her with confidence, but inside I was concerned: in a politically correct world, would this be the blow to sink Trump‚Äôs candidacy? Is the majority of Americans actually ready to defeat political correctness? Thankfully, Trump responded strongly, ignoring calls by the traitors in the Republican party to step down. 
The first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that Trump‚Äôs support didn‚Äôt decline. The fake controversy didn‚Äôt work. I held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out, maybe of him saying the n-word, but none did, and I knew the establishment had no more bullets. This was the moment where I finally believed. I felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that Trump was going to win. I did a Periscope that night as if I was amped up on methamphetamine, but I took no drug. 
From that point on it was just a matter of hanging on, until finally on November 8 when he was elected President. I was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when I was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against Trump. I didn‚Äôt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom I consider on the same team as us. If I made any miscalculation, it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces. I underestimated our own power, and those of our allies in the alternative internet space. Human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
The most important lesson I learned from Trump‚Äôs victory is how pointless it is to control human beings, both their behaviors and their minds. Every single major institution in the United States, represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence, could not stop a populist candidate, in spite of trying everything short of assassination. 
George Soros and his billions weren‚Äôt effective. Obama and his allies weren‚Äôt effective. The mainstream media and their dozens of outlets weren‚Äôt effective. CEOs of the biggest companies in the United States weren‚Äôt effective. Hollywood and it‚Äôs superstars weren‚Äôt effective. Academia and it‚Äôs thousands of professors weren‚Äôt effective. Social media and its censorship efforts weren‚Äôt effective. The FBI allowing Hillary to skate from real crimes wasn‚Äôt effective. Even Donald Trump‚Äôs own party wasn‚Äôt effective in stopping him. It‚Äôs absolutely incredible that all these forces couldn‚Äôt stop one man and his believers. What a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably! 
Think right now of how much effort the anti-Trump forces put into stopping him from winning. Think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome. And now think how it was all for nothing . They accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish, after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the American public. 
Whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existence‚Äînature, God, Tao, or so on‚Äîit is clear that humans cannot control it all, and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing, that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn, and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it. Imagine how impotent George Soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing. 
Now they have to perfect their control methods even more, open their pocket books further, and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full. Their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears, of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody, that they are powerful, that the world must be shaped into their image, that they are gods among men, but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money. Much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat, or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled. 
You can control human beings, but only temporarily and only some of them. At the end of the day, humans want to do what they want to do, and if you don‚Äôt possess what they wish to buy, they will go to someone who does, no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control. The more you control what does not want to be controlled, the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling, of which we are currently living through. In previous eras, that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets, but in our modern era, it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes. 
If you want to be a true leader of society, create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want, can freely engage in commerce, can create families, can live in safety, can search for the truth without interference, and can work and play and live according to their nature. Put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down. It may take a decade, it may take 100 years, but it will happen, and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness. Conclusion 
We are tired of being controlled. Leave us alone. We are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us, of forcing us to believe in falsehoods, of programming us to hate our country, of pitting woman against man and black against white. Leave us alone! Let men be men, and from that a new American renaissance will come forth. Men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives, and if you prevent us from doing so, we won‚Äôt allow you to live yours. We will humiliate your useful idiots, we will destroy your institutions, we will lash out with more than just memes. 
I‚Äôm afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us, but at least now we have our man in the White House who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years. I can‚Äôt wait to see where this fight takes us next.

A problem is that the globalism-nationalism framework is exactly the type of dialectic elites can use to usher in a global war or crackdown to further increase their power.
Imagine there is a wife who is tired of her husband going out every night with his friends to drink. Instead of nagging at him every evening, which would have the effect of motivating him to leave the house even sooner, she will wait until he gets into a drunk driving accident or serious bar fight so she could ‚Äúdraw the line‚Äù and make the reasonable ultimatum for him to never drink again. The husband is more likely to listen to her after something wrong takes place than after he had a safe night out.
Right now the nationalist movement is being allowed to gain strength so that a future event can act as a trigger for globalists to ‚Äúdraw the line‚Äù on the movement by imprisoning or killing its strongest members. In other words, globalists plan to use nationalism as a trap, a device they transform into to their advantage. As of right now, the budding nationalist movement is extremely useful in allowing them to identify all ‚Äúresisters‚Äù before easily crushing them when the time is right.
Elites cannot advance their plans without a dialectic 
The way the elites move an agenda forward is through a dialectic , meaning that two opposing ideologies rub against each other, create friction, and from that comes a desired result (i.e. ‚Äúorder from chaos‚Äù). Those in power either control or monitor the existence of both sides to guide and bend the dialectic to serve their ends.
The recent rise in nationalism, I speculate, has been allowed because previous dialectics such as capitalism vs communism and democracy vs terrorism are no longer useful in advancing the desired agenda. Soviet Communism is dead and increased terrorism did not allow planned wars in Syria and Iran to proceed like 9/11 did with Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, the white vs black race war is years late, stubbornly resistant to the gasoline that Obama pours onto the fire. A new dialectic must be nurtured, and so nationalism may just do the trick. Hillary‚Äôs recent alt right speech officially debuted American nationalism as the new ‚Äúenemy.‚Äù
While your conclusion that nationalism is logical and beneficial to a nation is true, and I‚Äôm sure to agree with it, you were guided onto those beliefs. How did you arrive at nationalist thought? Through decades of free trade, feminism, and open-door immigration that have worn you and your country down. Your arrival at nationalist conclusions is the direct result of globalism, which means that nationalist thoughts exist in your mind only because of the likes of George Soros, who pulled out a million Muslims from his hat and placed them in Europe while sponsoring a multitude of social justice organizations in the United States. His actions and behavior, along with other powerful globalists like him, have essentially created your very ideology, because you are entrenched in a dialectic where opposing forces must exist and be in combat with each other.
The growth of nationalism is ‚Äúuseful‚Äù Nationalism must continue to grow in power right before the moment it can threaten globalist banking and geopolitical interests, and when it does, the globalists will clamp down severely on it. As if replaying World War 2, they will identify a nationalist country as the big bad bully, and then use that country as an excuse to start a war that will simultaneously weed out nationalists throughout the world by sending them to die or having them arrested at home for ‚Äúsubversion‚Äù or ‚Äútreason.‚Äù Russia is the evil nationalist country that neocons and others have been poking, and even Poland is being puffed up into an ‚Äúundemocratic‚Äù country in order to hedge their bets.
A hint that this may already be taking place is that France recently called upon ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù to serve in their National Guard to ‚Äúprotect citizens.‚Äù Since when does France care about patriots? They have committed no consistent actions in the past decade that suggest they do care, so we must reasonably conclude that this new army is a trap to attract nationalists into a game where the end result is their death. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if France‚Äôs beefed-up army is used to start a war in a place like Poland, which will be painted as an aggressor that caused ‚Äúeconomic attacks‚Äù upon the saintly Western Europeans.
As long as you‚Äôre in the dialectic, which I see as a sort of Twilight Zone creation of the mega rich, you‚Äôre fighting on their terms. They need the nationalist ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù uprising to create violent events that allow them to re-assert control and power. Even though nationalism may be the most sane movement of the day, it still plays into their hands as long as we insist on having only two sides of the debate, good and evil, as if we were living in a Hollywood-style storyline. Instead of this two-dimensional arrangement, the solution may be to go 3D, where you can move front and back and around in a spectrum of ideas, instead of just left and right where you‚Äôre a pawn of the game no matter what side you pick.
Just because a nationalist ‚Äúresistance‚Äù is growing, doesn‚Äôt mean that that the globalists in power are being hurt. Without being able to effectively control the Western population through the Cold War, terrorism, racial divide-and-conquer, or modern Russian aggression, they are hoping that the nationalist movement grows enough to create the conflict that moves their chess pieces forward. While I‚Äôm not urging you to throw away your nationalist beliefs, as I surely won‚Äôt throw away mine, it is clear to me that a trap is waiting to be sprung, and we will all suffer when it‚Äôs finally launched.

Like many of you, I was outside with my fellow tribesmen ( the same tribe our opponents tried to shut down in February ) until about 4 A.M. on Election Day. As you may expect, it was a joyous occasion that I‚Äôll never forget.
Yet, as I remarked at the time, while this was a glorious victory, a decisive one that ended the campaign, the war would continue. I had hoped to be as magnanimous as possible in victory, to finally bridge some divides and begin to move past the insanity we‚Äôve been dealing with that‚Äôs accelerated in the past few years. However, as has quickly become apparent, the Cultural Marxists, SJW‚Äôs, and their globalist overlords have no intention of coming to terms or engaging in meaningful self-reflection anytime soon. Instead, they‚Äôre doubling down on everything that voters resoundingly rejected on November 8th.
Predictably, there have been ‚Äúprotests‚Äù and some riots. Incidents of violence on the left have taken place and gone underreported. Just as predictably, most of these ‚Äúprotests‚Äù are professionally organized , with George Soros likely pulling at least a few of the strings. Learning nothing, the regressive leftists taking to the streets, complete with their Year Zero pathology, think themselves morally justified in blocking streets and attacking people, because they‚Äôre on a mission to purify society. Anything that stands in the way of that mission can be justly eliminated. 
I came across one of these ‚Äúprotests‚Äù a few days ago. It was generic and small, basic bitch shit, really. But recall that these are merely the peons in the army of their overlords. Their intensity will dissipate with time. The safety-pin wearing, safe-space occupying, neon-haired freaks aren‚Äôt the ones to take note of on the grand strategic map. The bigger picture to focus on is the drive toward increased censorship in the past few days.
The recent counteroffensive began with the uproar over Donald Trump‚Äôs selection of Steve Bannon to be his chief White House strategist. The media and its acolytes on social media went into another coordinated attack, lambasting Bannon and Breitbart , which he ran, as having connections to the ‚Äúalt-right,‚Äù which in turn, they say, is ‚Äúassociated with white nationalism.‚Äù To reinforce this pairing, the media ran with a couple of the most controversial Breitbart headlines.
If you recognize this tactic, it‚Äôs because the media A/B tested this against Roosh in February. They took the ‚Äú How to Stop Rape ‚Äù headline, said that it proved that Roosh was ‚Äúpro-rape,‚Äù and then repeated endlessly.
This is actually a sort of hypnosis trick and was certainly done deliberately. Scott Adams calls this word-thinking :
Rational People: Use data and reason to arrive at truth. (This group is mostly imaginary.)
Word-Thinkers: Use labels, word definitions, and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking. This group is 99% of the world.
Persuaders: Use simplicity, repetition, emotion, habit, aspirations, visual communication, and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves. This group is about 1% of the population and effectively control the word-thinkers of the world.
He further describes the phenomenon of word-thinking :
Word-thinking is important to persuasion because if you can convince someone to accept a label on an opponent, it turns off their critical thought and turns on their confirmation bias. Nuance is lost. Context is lost. All that matters once the label is accepted is whatever qualities the label already contained.
And this is what the media is doing. They did it with Roosh and are now doing their damndest to do it to Bannon, no doubt as one of the thousand paper cuts they hope to use to take President Trump down.
Because the term ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù is relatively fresh, it‚Äôs vulnerable to being defined with the most ominous, dark terms possible, which is why the media is trying furiously to create as much connective tissue between it and ‚Äúwhite nationalism‚Äù as possible. Remember, with word-thinking, nuance and context are lost.
And now that this first step has been achieved where it was meant to, the self-anointed moral cover for the more alarming stage of the counteroffensive is underway. Now that the ambiguous and ominous-sounding ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù has been attempted to be extensively defined, the solution is obviously to crack down on it and anyone having to do with it (even if they really don‚Äôt). Given this pretext, the purges and censorship have begun, with numerous prominent Twitter accounts being suspended. Agree with these accounts or not (I often don‚Äôt), it should give you pause that this kind of blanket censorship is being implemented. If you‚Äôre just a little bit politically unorthodox, you‚Äôre now at heightened risk of being slapped with the ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù label (even if you‚Äôre on record as not identifying with it) and banned from outlets of communication that are both vital for pushing your ideas forward and for promoting any business you have.
But banning individuals is only stage one. Stage two is the recent drive by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others to censor what they call ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù The media has been on a blitz against these ‚Äúfake news‚Äù articles, completely unironically given that this is the same crowd that uncritically signal boosted the Rolling Stone rape hoax to the ends of the world, ‚Äúfact checks‚Äù Donald Trump‚Äôs comment that Hillary Clinton ‚Äúacid washed‚Äù her private email server, selectively edits clips to promote the narrative that their pets in ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù are entirely peaceful when they aren‚Äôt , and fails to disclose contacts and relationships with officials of the Democratic National Committee while writing about the campaign.
No, this is not the Onion.
While this drive deserves to be a subject of laughter, we must nevertheless still take it seriously. There have already been reports of shadow bans on Twitter with prominent figures such as Mike Cernovich and Scott Adams, and it‚Äôs far from out of the question that a blacklist of sorts gets put up for outlets such as Return Of Kings , which were crucial in taking control of the narrative during the campaign. All the while, the media continues to nitpick, inflate, and manufacture anything they can turn into a controversy about the incoming Trump administration. Narrative warfare is far from over.
What Can We Do? Fortunately, we have a master persuader in Donald Trump to lead the way, but we at the grassroots, the grunts in the trenches, if you will, must continue our efforts.
First, we need to begin to de-hypnotize those that can be. Scott Adams had some thoughts on that , but here are the crucial points:
1. The basis of the hypnosis in recent days has been around pairing the terms ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù and ‚Äúfake news‚Äù with all sorts of bad things.
2. Take away that pairing and you‚Äôve made significant inroads.
I‚Äôve A/B tested this sort of thing numerous times. Remember Mike Cernovich‚Äôs maxim that ‚Äúconflict is attention and attention is influence.‚Äù Here are a few pointers.
1. Just like with women, frame control is paramount. The inevitable tactic that they‚Äôll try to use is to associate anyone opposed to them with the worst elements of their ‚Äúside.‚Äù Fortunately, our opponents have arguably worse elements given their blanket of moral superiority and cultural influence. Refocus the frame on those. Make them own their own worst elements.
2. Appeal to vanity. Most people like to think of themselves as ‚Äúrational.‚Äù Tell them that their word-thinking is literally shutting down their critical thinking skills. I did this with a girl after the first debate, explaining to her that because ‚Äúthe movie in her head pictured a ‚ÄòMexican‚Äô in a certain way,‚Äù her critical thinking skills turned off, and that what Trump said about ‚Äúthe Mexican judge‚Äù would be equally applicable to someone of another heritage like ‚ÄúGerman.‚Äù It‚Äôs a long story, but her face was a picture. Tell them that they‚Äôre seeing things not based on reality, but on the movies playing in their heads, triggered by a certain word. Then watch the cognitive dissonance come.
On the broader level, here‚Äôs what we can do:
1. Continue on as usual. Continue to make a cultural impact. Get those websites, books, movies, and so on out there. Echoing what one member of the forum said: ‚Äúpolitics is air cover, culture is the ground war.‚Äù They can try to censor ‚Äúfake news‚Äù all they want, but we are too numerous to control if we don‚Äôt cooperate. It‚Äôs now time to redouble our efforts.
2. Don‚Äôt talk to any aggrieved victimhood class on social media if they‚Äôre acting hostile to you. They‚Äôll use any excuse to ban you. Law 36: Disdain Things You Cannot Have, Ignoring them is the Best Revenge.
3. Begin to build new networks. Gab is up and coming and is far more free speech friendly.
4. I will echo what many others have said on the forum. MAKE FUN OF THEM. They‚Äôre a prime target for humor. Believe me when I say most people are sick of the special snowflakes on the street as well as the media.
This is a time of great opportunity, but we need to readjust for the new moves our opponents are making. They‚Äôre doing everything they can to censor us and de-legitimize Trump. That‚Äôs the next focus of the campaign. We must de-legitimize them in turn.
But take heart that we‚Äôre now in the ascendant. Otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be making these moves. I recall when I first visited Return Of Kings and the forum nearly four years ago, there was a general malaise in the atmosphere. Day after day, it seemed, we were suffering another defeat. No longer.
What a ride it‚Äôs been.

Although it ultimately proves destructive to western societies to give women ‚Äúequality,‚Äù at least the first and second wave had something legitimate to bitch about. Third wave feminism; not so much, and today we‚Äôll talk about the underlying motives and the end game of it all.
When one looks at modern feminism, you see women who have ‚Äúflipped the script,‚Äù to use their term, and rewired life so that men are not necessary for them. A modern feminist has her own job that can meet her needs, but maybe not all her wants, and has her own small place with her cat(s) and Netflix. When she wants the company of men, she goes out and sluts it up and is always successful due to the biological imperative of men.
On the surface, a feminist woman may appear to be the analog of a Red Pill Man, yet, upon closer examination, she is actually an imperfect copy. A man works harder, more dangerous jobs, and makes more money because of it, thus he has money for anything he wants and more. A proper man has interesting hobbies and a healthy, fit lifestyle, and he must do this to fulfill his potential and inner drive, but also because he realizes that normal men do not get laid due to hypergamy and he must be the best he can be if he wants to be successful with women.
However, the most crucial difference lies in the outcome. Women, who outlast their shelf lives while still being single are miserable, and I fully expect the suicide rate of women of my generation to skyrocket in about 5 years from now. Men, whose value is based on their production and can enjoy a later in life peak than women, also can live for other things than companionship and family, and can be quite happy on their own, even if they did want a family at one time, or still do.
So, the question is, if women, despite their feminist pandering to the contrary, actually DO want a man to live with and grow old with, why is third wave feminism devoted to stopping that in every which way? The answer, like most things, lies in the red pill philosophy. Women, including feminists, only want the best men; modern feminism is nothing more than a nuclear-level shit test.
A woman needs an alpha man like a fish needs water SJW society today tells us that men are not supposed to hit on women in the grocery store, in the bookstore, or at the coffee shop because that‚Äôs a precursor to stalking or some shit. At night, you‚Äôre not supposed to hit on girls at the bar or club, because they are there with the friends and not looking for that. At work, you‚Äôre not even supposed to talk to women about anything other than work-related topics because that‚Äôs harassment.
If you are wondering where is a guy supposed to meet girls, then you get the point and the answer is that you‚Äôre not. Feminists, and women in general, know that any man who actually allows them to regulate his behavior is not a man worth having in the first place, so they are only interested in men that see that the answer to feminism‚Äôs constraints is to ignore them in the first place.
Combining the above shit test with hypergamy will result in a winning combo. If a man is successful, good looking, and alpha enough, he has a good chance of pulling another man‚Äôs wife directly out of their marriage and family and taking her away. Women are ultimately interested only in their own self interest and that means, when confronted with the best man she has ever beheld, she will go against feminism because it is not in her own best self interest at the time, and instead, be receptive to the man in hopes of snaring him.
Ultimately, women DO still need and want men, they just don‚Äôt want to be bothered by inferior men, and third wave feminism does a good job of convincing the betas to stay away until they are wanted for their paychecks by post-Wall NASCAR-style wrecks of women.
When is enough enough? When you look at feminism logically (which is hard), you can come up with the premise that women have been disadvantaged over history, and feminism is an effort to balance the scales. They will disguise it in self-depreciating irony ‚Äúfeminism is the radical notion that men and women are equal,‚Äù but what they really men is that men and women should be equal over the balance of history, and, since women have been so disadvantaged, men had better get ready for some suck to square the accounts.
I bet she‚Äôs been in 100 ROK articles by now‚Ä¶
The question then follows, if men ‚Äúowe‚Äù women, how much are we talking? Can it ever be paid off, or have women been so heinously treated over the entirety of our existence that there will never be enough atonement to make up for it? I have three theories.
It could be that men have apparently treated women so badly for all time that it can never be paid off because it‚Äôs an absolute. The problem with absolutes is they lack scope. The worst atrocities in history have been borne by both men and women alike, and it could be said that men have borne the heavier half, as they are usually expected to die before defeat in war, whereas women, although they get raped by the conquerors, at least get to live. I doubt most women have been treated that badly, though, on the balance, so there is probably some finite amount of penance men would do to restore ‚Äúequality.‚Äù
The other two theories center on the idea that, eventually, men will atone for all faults perceived by feminism, and the only difference lies in what happens then. My second idea is not a noble one, but it is probably the most accurate. Feminists, you see, are not for equality, they are for female supremacy, and, once ‚Äúequality‚Äù is reached, women will get to be on top for millennia. Some would say we are already at that point, and this is why anyone who is not a feminist can see why the movement has faltered and lost whatever relevance it ever had. When you already have it all, shouldn‚Äôt you stop and try to actually make things equal, that is, if you actually have moral integrity?
That‚Äôs the third idea, the concept of, once all debts are paid, ‚Äútrue equality‚Äù would rule. I doubt this one would ever happen, as our victimhood-empowerment culture makes it advantageous to be a victim, and you can‚Äôt be a victim if your demographic is on top. Plus, being ‚Äúfeelers,‚Äù not ‚Äúthinkers,‚Äù the average woman lacks the intellectual capacity to be honest with themselves.
Conclusion Combining the idea of feminism being a massive shit test to guys and a scam to win money and prizes from society just because you have a vagina, one can see that the only solution is to treat it like the cult bullshit it is. While that is nothing new for those of us here at Return of Kings , and nothing new for those our message reaches, the reason we must treat it like that has hopefully been a little more exposed to the light here.
The reason that feminism makes no sense, and makes it seem like all men have no way to succeed and must lose everything is because that is precisely the point. There is no way to win, there is no equality, there is only female superiority, males that go along with it, and men that do not.

For centuries, mankind has questioned everything. Mankind‚Äôs quest for the answer to what drives us, and what pushes us forward in times of darkness is not exempt from analysis. In fact, it‚Äôs been a consistent theme since the dawn of time. Stoicism , although not directly attributed to answering ‚Äòwhat drives us‚Äô, skirts around the topic and creates a general set of principles to help us deal with negative externalities in life.
While many philosophers have pontificated on the subject of mankind‚Äôs driving force, and the ‚Äòwill to live‚Äô, there‚Äôs a problem inherent with such an analysis. In order to research such a basic, and instinctual topic, one needs to experience a visceral, cerebral experience that brings him or her to a basic, instinctual level, before having such an epiphany. One needs to examine our animalistic base, and then explore logically from there.
One such analysis is known as Logotherapy, from the Greek word logos(wise) . Logotherapy, developed by Viktor Frankl, is an influential school of psychotherapy, that is founded on the pillars of ‚Äòwhat motivates mankind‚Äô. Before we delve into Logotherapy, however, it‚Äôs important that we discuss Viktor Frankl‚Äîwho he was, and why his unique perspective provides for an incredibly powerful source of credibility and authority.
Viktor Frankl was born in 1905, in what was at that time known as Austria-Hungary. Frankl was a neurologist, and psychiatrist. His early life was relatively unspectacular, but from an early age he displayed an interest in philosophy, as well as psychotherapy. Initially interested in Freud and Adler‚Äôs work, he began to see their faults, and eventually diverged from their teachings‚Äîbecoming particularly interested in depression, as well as suicide.
During 1933-1937, Frankl, in completing his residency in neurology, was responsible for setting up the Selbstm√∂rderpavillon , translated in English to ‚Äúthe suicide pavilion‚Äù. It‚Äôs estimated that Frankl, along with his staff, treated upwards of 30,000 women who had suicidal tendencies.
In September of 1942, his life was shaken. Frankl, along with his wife and family, were deported to a Nazi concentration camp, known as Theresienstadt ghetto. Whilst there, and during his stay at Auschwitz, Frankl worked as a doctor in the psychiatric care unit, focusing on mental health, helping newcomers deal with shock and grief.
In 1946, after three years in a concentration camp, Frankl released his book entitled Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning , which details his experiences as a holocaust survivor, as well as his theory, which became known as Logotherapy. The book is divided into two parts‚Äîpart one is a detailed account of his experiences, whereas part two discusses Logotherapy.
His time in the numerous concentration camps began to shape his philosophical, and psychiatric theory. While he had read books on the subject of ‚Äòpsychological healing‚Äô prior to his imprisonment, he had never experienced it to the degree in which he had become accustomed to. Particularly intrigued as to why some prisoners lived longer than others, Frankl began to organize his thoughts and document how the average prisoner‚Äôs life in a concentration camp was reflected in their mind. As a doctor focusing on grief and shock-stricken inmates, he was in a very unique position.
Hundreds, and during some weeks thousands, of helpless inmates were carted in Auschwitz, the most-feared concentration camp, weekly. Between the inmates sleeping next to him, and those seeking treatment, Frankl noted that each prisoner, without exception faced three stages of psychological reactions once entering the concentration camp. These stages were; shock, apathy, and depersonalization.
While seemingly unimportant, the noted documentation of these stages was very important for Frankl. As he began to notice, while every inmate experienced these stages, some experienced them to a less cerebral degree. Some inmates seemed less depressive than others, and featured a happier disposition. These inmates‚Äîwith some expected variability‚Äîoutlived the other inmates.
Discovery As he began to poke and prod, Frankl noticed something that separated these individuals from others‚Äî hope. There is never not meaning in life. Every moment no matter how painful, dehumanizing or horrendous it is, has meaning. By extension, Frankl suggests, even suffering is meaningful. The inmates that survived the longest‚Äîthe ones that outlived the rest, had hope. Frankl suggested that he could tell whether or not an inmate would live just by looking at their faces‚Äîthe face of a dejected, depressed inmate was obvious and clear as day. Without hope, they were doomed.
‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms‚Äîto choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way.‚Äù
The next question that Frankl sought to answer was an important one, and the foundational maxim of Logotherapy‚Äîwhy did some men have hope, and others not?
The answer, was love.
‚ÄúThe truth ‚Äì that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which Man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of Man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.‚Äù
Frankl, in his book Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning recounted several instances where he would be driven into brief stints of depression; after a beating, during a late-night march in bare feet, or watching his friend get treated inhumanely. He‚Äôd vacillate from depression by thinking, and longing for his wife. The men whom lasted the longest, invariably had a wife, or a job that they loved. It was this motivator, the unquantifiable love, that pushed men in inhuman circumstances to existentially escape the physical realm, and put mind above body.
What we can get from this To answer this, Frankl codified three ways that he discovered is how we can find meaning in life ‚Äì A job, love, and how we react to suffering. It‚Äôs important to realize that while it‚Äôs easy to read this and assume that Frankl is saying we should all suffer in order to find meaning‚Äîhe‚Äôs not. He IS suggesting, however, that should we not have a job/deed, or love that allow us to find meaning in life, we can still find meaning by choosing how to react in a negative situation‚Äîour mental freedom is one of the only things that can never be taken from us, theoretically speaking.
The average man will never be faced with such a dire circumstance such as the atrocities that Frankl and so many others dealt with. What we can do, however, is choose how we react to life‚Äôs adversities.
A fair assessment of Logotherapy is that it provides a simplistic solution to a complex question (life). Since life is such a complex series of events, Logotherapy offers a solution that may not be representative of life‚Äôs true hardships and intricacies. In saying this, my own personal evaluation is that, this criticism in itself may have flaws, by assuming that a complex question must have a complex solution. Even the assumption that life in complex can be debated. It‚Äôs a cliched saying that ‚Äòlife is hard‚Äô, or complex‚Äîand even if it is, it‚Äôs not out of the realm of possibility that a complex question has a simple solution ‚Äì sometimes the answer we seek is right in front of us.
Viktor Frankl died in September 1997, and his works are still read today. Several Logotherapy institutes exist today named after him.

Their shirts off, red and sweaty, they have a large group of peers around them, cheering, eyes wide and knuckles white. Would you stop them or give the young scraps some advice? Do you see a violent squabble or boys acting on natural impulses which will better equip them to defend their family and neighbours later in life? The answer you give is, in large part, dependent on your gender; so, the fact that this scenario would make an increasingly large number of men upset is a sign of a collapsing civilization. But, nil desperandum , Western civilization has the solution!
Mere horseplay!
As an early years professional, I saw education academics acknowledging the data‚Äîboys need ‚Äòrough and tumble‚Äô play for their mental and physical wellbeing! But they have no way of encouraging this in institutions where boys are immediately reprimanded for making finger-pistols at each other. Without saying it directly, they thought that the majority female teaching staff for younger age ranges were pushing our boys‚Äô natural urge to fight like lion-cubs underground. What‚Äôs more, the boys were made to feel bad about themselves and their very nature.
Their solution? They suggested that more men be encouraged to teach younger children and engage in rough play with them. Until the late 1800‚Äôs, education was male dominated and boys spent a lot of time with male mentors. But, of course, there has been no effort to bring back that environment. Instead, a compromise between boys being boys and boys being fairy princesses was achieved‚Äîplaying superheroes.
As though female teachers are going to tone down the disapproval as the boys shoot lasers and magic at each other. The treacherous political class present only feeble attempts to manage the symptoms of our societal masculinity problem; like sticking some tape over the burst pipe of our hemorrhaging testosterone as cultural marxism continues to swing the pick-axe of nth-wave feminism at it. So, it‚Äôs high time we took a few swings back.
But, first, we need to teach our lads how to fight. At the age of 6 or 7, Viking children were taught the martial art of Glima. This was not just father and son play-fighting; boys and occasionally girls already wrestle with friends and family up to that age. This was more systematic, a group activity.
The Greeks also taught their boys how to wrestle because our other ancestors could see the big picture. The Hoplites, for example, were individualistic free men of all ages who voluntarily came together to practise combat; this not only strengthened their communities but also allowed these farmers to fend off the Persian Empire. Yet, today, even isolated expressions of violence in computer games are questioned by SJW‚Äôs. Nevertheless, all the signs are there‚Äîour boys are yearning for the same activities practised by their forefathers.
At college, I started a unofficial fight club‚Äîmen only. This based in large part on the book and movie of the same name, in which the narrator‚Äôs Nietzschean alter ego, Tyler Durden, describes the bubbling frustration inside the ever-increasing number of 30-somethings coming together for underground fights: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre a generation of men raised by women.‚Äô Naturally, half the guys in my year were participating within a week. But, our young boys should be taught how to fight openly and without shame to avoid hidden expressions of violence and maybe even some mass-shootings by angry, loner teens. When they are young, it is the perfect time to teach them.
Young lads have no intention of seriously injurying their friends; it‚Äôs just good fun and produces healthier attitudes towards violence and confidence in self-defence and the defence of one‚Äôs community. Furthermore, a recent study has shown that fighting helps to strengthen peer relationships, meaning less bullying and segregation. It is interesting to compare the codes of honour of ancient Greek wrestling etc. with those we intuit as wrestling children.
No intentional hitting or kicking No gouging the eyes or biting No going for the balls! That‚Äôs precisely how I used to wrestle with my brothers and friends as a pup; it was just obvious. If someone took things ‚Äòtoo far‚Äô, they were ostracised from the fun, at least until they calmed down and apologised. If someone got hurt, we stopped, checked whether they were just being a pussy or needed to get themselves mended; we kept calm and carried on.
‚ÄòWe‚Äôre a generation of men raised by women.‚Äô ‚Äì Tyler Durden
The data are screaming that men haven‚Äôt changed, especially our need to practise fighting. We still have the same natural impulses but their suppression, no, their demonisation has made our men weak and submissive. So much so, many are self-deprecating betas who believe masculinity is toxic, full of white guilt and ashamed of Western civilization. We have everything to be proud of and need to encourage our boys‚Äô fighting spirit so they grow some balls, some confidence in themselves and their kin. That‚Äôs the spirit which has kept our enemies, foreign and domestic at bay for thousands of years and will do the same to cultural Marxism, malevolent immigrants and anyone else who wants to have a go. If we want to turn scrapping boys into men first and gentlemen second, we need to organise some fights, not break them up.

On Sunday, Wikileaks gave Hillary Clinton less than a 24-hour window to drop out of the race or they will dump something that will destroy her ‚Äúcompletely.‚Äù 
Recently, Julian Assange confirmed that WikiLeaks was not working with the Russian government , but in their pursuit of justice they are obligated to release anything that they can to bring light to a corrupt system ‚Äì and who could possibly be more corrupt than Crooked Hillary? 
‚ÄúThe Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything. Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That‚Äôs false ‚Äì we can say that the Russian government is not the source,‚Äù Assange said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúHillary Clinton is just one person. I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick ‚Äì for example faint ‚Äì as a result of going on, and going with their ambitions. But she represents a whole network of people, and a whole network of relationships with particular states.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHey, @HillaryClinton, you have until Monday to drop out, or we will destroy you completely,‚Äù the cryptic tweet says. 
It is unknown what information WikiLeaks has that has not already been released. Is it proof that Bill molested children when he was with his friend Epstein? Is it something, dare I say, worse? 
Part of me hopes that she stays in the race so we can find out what it is. The rest of me just wants her gone.

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs sad last push for votes was supposed to culminate in a gathering of ‚Äútalent‚Äù the left was calling ‚ÄúThe Avengers of campaigning.‚Äù Hillary, Slick Willy, Barry Soetoro and Moochelle along with Creepy Uncle Joe Biden were to all come together at a huge show featuring hasbeens Bon Jovi and working class sellout Bruce Springsteen. 
From one libtard to the next, promises of work-free lives filled with food stamp steak and lobster flew amid delusional dreams of free college education for everyone and a health care system that will cure what ails you for eleven bucks a month, no questions asked. The $15 minimum wage and 90 percent tax on the people who have done well in America were celebrated with great vigor, until it came time for the woman of the hour herself to take the stage. 
Bruce Springsteen, acting as master of ceremonies, shouted over the roar of the feminist-laden crowd, ‚ÄúHere she is, and I‚Äôm with her!‚Äù Unfortunately, she never appeared in the spotlight. 
Springsteen, after holding a finger to his earpiece, picked up his acoustic guitar and started slowly picking away a familiar tune. He turned to the audience and said: 
‚ÄúYou know, before the next President of the United States comes out here I want to make sure we‚Äôre all ready. Are you ready?‚Äù The crowd cheered. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one thing we‚Äôve always known about this amazing woman, one thing that w2as never in question, it‚Äôs that she was born to run.‚Äù 
As the crowd went nuts for the popular song, interns and medical staff were reportedly attending to Clinton backstage after she collapsed from an unknown ailment. The press was quickly corralled and swept aside, but a couple of rogue stagehands tweeted about the incident before they were discovered and their posts deleted. This screenshot was grabbed within a minute of it being tweeted: 
Clinton is said to have looked pale and distant, unaware of her surroundings. As of the writing of this article, Springsteen was still playing his set.

Democrats want you to think voter fraud is a myth, but that‚Äôs because the Democrat Party benefits so much from it. In July, Election Justice USA, for example, reported that without Clinton‚Äôs team committing egregious acts of voter fraud, Sanders would have been the man to lose to Donald Trump in the national election. Instead, we have Pantsuits McCriminal, and what happened Friday is absolute proof that she will do literally anything to win. 
Fox 10 Phoenix reports that nine illegal immigrants complete with fake identification and voter registration cards, and stolen social security numbers, voted at around 9 am a Desert Wind Middle School in Pinal County. At 10:30, the very same white van carrying the very same illegals was spotted at Santa Rosa Elementary School and they voted there as well. Just two hours later, the same group showed up at the Global Water Center to cast their vote. 
By this point, poll workers had been notified and one of those Poll Watchers liberals hate so much pretended to take a poll and asked them whom they had voted for. In broken English, one man who identified himself as Jose Gutierrez said ‚ÄúI am voting for Hillary Clinton many times.‚Äù 
And vote many times he did. Mr. ‚ÄúGutierrez‚Äù and friends voted in two more locations, their spree ending in Maricopa County where a Sheriff was waiting for them. The nine beloved ‚Äúundocumented persons‚Äù as Democrats call them were arrested and charged with attempted in-person voter fraud and several other charges. Unfortunately, only one will be deported. 
‚ÄúThey were just enthusiastic. Most of these people do not have criminal records before this,‚Äù an immigration official says, ‚Äúwith the exception of Enrique Calderon of Mexico.‚Äù The official explained that Calderon is wanted on two counts of rape and six counts of drug trafficking back in Mexico, where he will be returning soon. 
Why aren‚Äôt the rest being sent back with him? Ask Obama.

After Melania Trump‚Äôs brilliant speech about cyberbullying went viral, leftist elites immediately began attacking her. It seems they consider her husband, the next President of the United States, to be a cyber bully himself because he likes to tell the truth on Twitter. 
One of those leftists, Lady Gaga, Tweeted an insult at Mrs. Trump that probably deserved some kind of snarky, rude response, but the future First Lady has far too much class for that. She proved it yet again Sunday night when the two came face to face in New York City. Gaga, or GooGoo as she should be called, proved yet again that she has no class, shouting ‚Äúwhore‚Äù and ‚Äúgo back to YOUR country‚Äù at Melania from across a sidewalk being cleared by the Secret Service. 
Mrs. Trump, class act that she is, simply smiled at the overrated pop star, which seemed to enrage the little ball of hate even more. Witnesses say that they saw GooGoo throw something at Mrs. Trump, which is where the Secret Service stepped in. 
The New York Post tried to reach out to the NYPD after it was reported that GooGoo was taken away in a black Yukon in handcuffs, but as of yet there‚Äôs no record of an arrest.

Recorded audio of a series of phone conversations between former President Bill Clinton and his mistress, Gennifer Flowers, have recently surfaced.
In one of the recordings, from 1991, Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, is heard advising Flowers to deny any claims that he had aided her in getting a state job.
‚ÄúIf they ever asked if you‚Äôd talked to me about it, you can say no,‚Äù he says.

At the time of the recording, the media had been asking many questions about Clinton‚Äôs affair with Flowers and she was worried that the barrage of questions could inevitably lead to inquires into how she landed her job as an administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
 
A complaint was being filed by an anonymous woman who felt that Flowers‚Äô relationship with Clinton kept her from getting the job when, the woman claimed, she was more qualified.
In the audio, Clinton is heard coaching Flowers on how best to deal with the woman and subsequent questions that may arise.
The sections of the audio recordings dealing with the state job were given to the news media in 1992. This came just one day after Clinton had appeared on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary ‚Äî the current Democratic presidential nominee ‚Äî blatantly denying any romantic relationship with Flowers.
However, in his deposition for a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones, Clinton would eventually admit to having a sexual interaction with Flowers in 1998.

In the past year, Americans have seen police officers ambushed and assassinated, and they have watched as the thin line protecting citizens from criminals has been reviled by groups such as Black Lives Matter.
And now America is taking its stand.
A new Gallup poll shows that respect for the police has hit its highest point in almost 50 years.

‚ÄúObviously, this violent rhetoric we have seen from BLM has backfired ,‚Äù wrote Andrew Mark Miller on Young Conservatives.
‚ÄúPeople respect the cops more than ever and they clearly see what a difficult job they have,‚Äù he added.
 
Miller said the Black Lives Matter movement denies its true purpose.
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt give me this nonsense about how BLM isn‚Äôt anti-police,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIn fact, many BLM supporters have been out there saying we should eliminate the police force entirely .‚Äù
Miller said the bottom line is clear.
‚ÄúThis poll is a repudiation of the tactics the left has used to demonize law enforcement. No getting around it,‚Äù he wrote.
 
Trending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio The level of Americans supporting the police that was reflected in the 2016 poll had not been reached since 1967, when urban riots and protest-driven long, hot summers were making cities dangerous and 77 percent of respondents said they gave police ‚Äúa great deal‚Äù of respect. Gallup began surveying Americans about the police in 1965.
The 2016 poll also shows a major change in attitudes from just a year earlier. The 2015 poll showed the highest level to date of Americans lacking confidence in their police officers, at 18 percent.
‚ÄúThe increase in shootings of police coincided with high-profile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. Despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents, respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites,‚Äù Gallup reported in analyzing its results.
‚ÄúThe sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive ‚Äî both politically and for their lives while they are on duty ‚Äî amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings,‚Äù it added.
Gallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer,‚Äù it wrote.

Ezekiel Emanuel laughed on Wednesday as the hosts of MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe joked about his brainchild, Obamacare, which on Tuesday Emanuel noted was going to cause severe fiscal pain for at least a million Americans.
On Wednesday‚Äôs show, Mika Brzezinski noted that Emanuel, a former adviser to President Barack Obama is ‚Äúoften called one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that working for you right now, Zeke?‚Äù chimed in host Joe Scarborough.

Emanuel was once again all smiles.
 
A day before, there were not many smiles when Emanual appeared on CNN and told Jake Tapper the extent of Obamacare‚Äôs fiscal effects.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a million people for whom this is going to be severe or uncomfortable,‚Äù he said.
Earlier this week, the Obama administration announced that the average premium costs will rise 25 percent next year. However, some states were far higher. A popular ‚Äú silver‚Äù healthcare plan is scheduled to increase 116 percent in Arizona; 40 percent in North Carolina; and 53 percent in Pennsylvania.
Emanuel said the problem of rising premiums some Americans will have trouble affording is just part of the way Obamacare evolved.

That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fatal,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúThese price increases that we‚Äôre seeing this year are a one-time increase relative to the fact that insurance companies didn‚Äôt know who was going to come in, under-priced their premiums in the first few years, and are readjusting them based on who‚Äôs in the marketplace,‚Äù said Emanuel, suggesting that tweaking the system will fix the problem.

‚ÄúBy the way, if I said that, they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs violent. How could he have done that?'‚Äù Trump said.
Trump, who according to one recent poll has a narrow lead in Florida, told supporters that he was confident of victory .
‚ÄúIn 14 days we are going to win the state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House,‚Äù he declared.
‚ÄúWe have a thing going on that they have never seen before. It is a movement. They have never seen anything like it before. We are going to win and we are going to bring back a lot of good things including common sense to the White House,‚Äù Trump added.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president.
Coming off of campaign events in Florida Tuesday and before he jetted off to North Carolina to resume his quest for the White House, Trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., built in the city‚Äôs historic Old Post Office building.
‚ÄúUnder budget and ahead of schedule. So important. We don‚Äôt hear those words so often, but you will,‚Äù said Trump , linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president. ‚ÄúToday is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country.‚Äù
 
Related Stories Trump Sets GOP Fundraising Milestone In Small-Donor Contributions Newt Gingrich Defends Donald Trump Against ‚ÄòSexual Predator‚Äô Accusations Donald Trump‚Äôs Star On Hollywood Walk Of Fame Vandalized Trump also spoke as a developer, not just as a candidate.
‚ÄúMy job is to look at undeveloped spaces and imagine what they could be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese are spaces that have no hope, no future. But you need imagination and you need the ability to get them done and to unlock their potential, and to unlock the potential of the people working on those spaces and on those projects, and we have so many things we can do for our country.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe United States is great,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great. Its people are great. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside of our reach. Don‚Äôt ever let anyone tell you it can‚Äôt be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.‚Äù
 
The fact that Trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction.
Republican strategist Steve Schmidt , who helped Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in his 2008 White House race, was among those who said Trump‚Äôs priorities were skewed.
‚ÄúThe walls are collapsing,‚Äù Schmidt said, referring to polls showing Trump behind. Trump has discounted those polls as inaccurate and pointed to others that show him leading.

Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway suggested that a dose of perspective might be useful.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs making a pit stop here in Washington and his under-budget, ahead-of-schedule hotel is really remarkable. It shows Americans the tangible accomplishments of Donald Trump. He‚Äôs somebody who builds things. He‚Äôs somebody who fixes things,‚Äù she said Wednesday on NBC‚Äôs Today show.

Conway dared anyone to find a candidate with a more active schedule than Trump.
‚ÄúHillary Clinton took five days off to prepare for one debate and everybody looked at that as some kind of noble exercise with 23 days to go. Nobody covered that as, where is she? Why doesn‚Äôt she campaign much? What is she doing? Where is she hiding?‚Äù Conway said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got the most active campaign schedule of the two candidates by far.‚Äù

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reached a financial accomplishment that no other GOP candidate has before.
He has amassed the largest small-donor fundraising pack that has ever been seen in the Republican Party.
Zac Moffatt, an online fundraising expert, said that only those most committed to the candidate will typically donate.
 
Related Stories Newt Gingrich Defends Donald Trump Against ‚ÄòSexual Predator‚Äô Accusations Donald Trump‚Äôs Star On Hollywood Walk Of Fame Vandalized Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio ‚ÄúThe people who donate are your core believers,‚Äù said Moffatt, who was digital director for Mitt Romney‚Äôs 2012 campaign.
Romney and Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than Trump has in total contributions.
However, Trump‚Äôs campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions, defined as $200 or less.
 
In this category, Trump has raised more than $78.6 million thus far, based on data from the Federal Election Commission.
In comparison, McCain raised $65.5 million and Romney raised $44.8 million by this point in their election races.
While McCain and Romney had significant income contributions from other sources, Trump‚Äôs small-donor income makes up 58 percent of his overall funds.
According to OpenSecrets.org, small donations are a key category because for those below $200 mark the campaigns aren‚Äôt legally required to register personal information on the donor, whereas if the donation exceeds $200 the campaign must give the donor‚Äôs name, occupation, employer and ZIP code.

As of Oct. 19, the Trump campaign ceased all events meant to raise money for the party‚Äôs get-out-the-vote effort, electing instead to have Trump focus on getting across his final message to voters.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve kind of wound down,‚Äù said Steven Mnuchin, Trump‚Äôs national finance chairman. ‚ÄúBut the online fundraising continues to be strong.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],‚Äù Mnuchin continued. ‚ÄúUnlike [Democratic nominee] Hillary [Clinton], who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.‚Äù
This decision has been questioned by some given that Clinton‚Äôs campaign has raised $445.4 million, according to OpenSecrets, which is $226.6 million more than the $218.8 million Trump has raised.
Clinton has 41 events lined up before Nov. 4.

There‚Äôs a reason David Brock, founder of the liberal group Media Matters for America, chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super PACs and nonprofits.
Professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts. Brock wants his unregistered solicitor, the Bonner Group, to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason.
David Brock is laundering money

Uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations.
The Bonner Group, his professional solicitor, works off a commission. Every time money gets passed around, Bonner receives a 12.5 percent cut.
 
Follow the money 
Nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants.
But they aren‚Äôt required to disclose who gives them cash grants.
This weak system of one-way verification is being abused by Brock. He‚Äôs been cycling money between his organizations for years, and the Bonner Group‚Äôs 12.5 percent commission gets triggered after every pass.

The Bonner Group was credited for raising these funds. Media Matters paid it a $1.1 million commission.
That same year, Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock‚Äôs Franklin Education Forum , an organization that shares office space with Media Matters.
In 2014, the Franklin Education Forum reported $994,000 in total contributions, and 93.6 percent of that total came from Media Matters.
Surprisingly, though, the Franklin Education Forum gave full credit to Bonner for raising that money. It paid the fundraiser a $124,250 commission in 2014.
Notice what happened? 
Brock‚Äôs Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock‚Äôs Franklin Education Forum. Brock‚Äôs Franklin Education Forum credited the Bonner Group for raising those funds, triggering the 12.5 percent commission. Brock paid the Bonner Group a $124,250 commission to solicit a cash grant ‚Ä¶ from himself! It doesn‚Äôt stop there 
After the Franklin Education Forum retained $869,750, it sent a $816,224 cash grant to Brock‚Äôs Franklin Forum . 
Note: The Franklin Education Forum is a 501(c)3, and The Franklin Forum is a 501(c)4. They are not the same company. 
The Franklin Forum 501(c)4 paid Bonner a commission in 2013 , so it‚Äôs safe to assume the fundraiser received a $102,028 commission in 2014. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs hard to tell for sure. It still hasn‚Äôt filed its taxes for 2014!
Let‚Äôs recap 
Say, for example, you donate $1,062,857 to Media Matters for America. This is how David Brock would have used your charitable donation in 2014:
Media Matters would receive your $1,062,857 donation. The Bonner Group would earn a $132,857 commission. Media Matters would retain $930,000. Next, Media Matters would give what‚Äôs left of your entire donation , $930,000, to the Franklin Education Forum. The Bonner Group would ‚Äúearn‚Äù a $116,250 commission. The Franklin Education Forum would retain $813,750. The Franklin Education Forum would then forward the remaining $813,750 to The Franklin Forum. The Bonner Group would ‚Äúearn‚Äù a $101,718 commission. The Franklin Forum would retain $712,031. In the end, Brock‚Äôs solicitor would have pocketed $350,825, almost a third of your initial donation. That‚Äôs a far cry from the advertised 12.5 percent commission.
As bizarre as that scenario may sound, this is exactly what Brock did in 2014.
How can we be sure this is intentional? 
Brock is the chairman for each of these organizations. How could he not know what‚Äôs going on?
He‚Äôs a hands-on chairman. According to their tax returns, Brock allocates time, weekly, to his organizations:
Media Matters: 31.50 hours per week Franklin Education Forum: three hours per week The Franklin Forum: one hour per week Furthermore, The New York Times reports that Brock shares a summer rental in the Hamptons with Mary Pat Bonner, the president of the Bonner Group.
Brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this. These transfers are intentional. He vacations with his solicitor. Case closed.
Still not convinced? 
Brock didn‚Äôt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers. They all share the same number.
What if ‚Ä¶? 
We even located the Bonner Group‚Äôs solicitation agreement with Media Matters on Florida‚Äôs Gift Givers‚Äô Guide . Clarification on the commission can be found on page 2:
In English: Contractually, Brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission. In spite of this option, he intentionally chooses to trigger the 12.5 percent commission for money grants between his organizations.
Note: Yes, we are making the assumption that all of Brock‚Äôs organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the Bonner Group. Given that his organizations share the same address, board members and telephone number, we feel it‚Äôs safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement. 
This barely scratches the surface 
Utilizing public-facing tax returns, along with records submitted to the Federal Election Commission, we mapped out all the significant money transfers from 2014 that took place in Brock‚Äôs office:
Summary 
This is all from just one year! No further commentary required.
We understand this may be hard to believe. We first came across this in July, and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it.
All of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources. Check for yourself ‚Äî we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in Brock‚Äôs office. These data have been sitting out in the open, gathering dust for years. 
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.
We‚Äôve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity. But there aren‚Äôt any loopholes. David Brock has something to hide. Just last month, The Daily Caller reported the following:
‚ÄúBrock‚Äôs former long-time live-in boyfriend William Grey (whom Brock has thanked in several of his books) threatened to go to the IRS with damaging information about how Brock was running his Media Matters empire. What did Brock do? He paid Grey $850,000 to keep quiet. Brock reportedly had to sell his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, to come up with the money. This certainly seems to indicate that Brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover.‚Äù
Adding to this, Fox News reported the following:
‚ÄúGrey accused Brock of ‚Äòfinancial malfeasance‚Äô and threatened to undermine Brock‚Äôs fundraising efforts.
‚Äú‚ÄòNext step is I contact all your donors and the IRS,‚Äô Grey wrote in an email dated May 19, 2010. ‚ÄòThis is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now.'‚Äù
We believe that the information presented in this article is what has Brock so terrified. We feel confident in saying, with close to absolute certainty, that David Brock is laundering money through his Media Matters conglomerate.

In 2002, Elizabeth Smart was abducted during the night at knifepoint from her bedroom at only 14-years-old.
Her kidnapping quickly garnered national media attention. Her media savvy parents worked overtime to keep her story in the news throughout the ordeal.
During her 9 months in captivity she was raped repeatedly, often as many as 3-4 times per day. Each day was a mental and physical war for her to survive at the hands of her kidnapper and rapist, Brian David Mitchell.

Her disappearance and subsequent miraculous return to her family made her one of the best known teenagers in America at the time.
Justice wasn‚Äôt finally served until 2011 when Mitchell received two life-terms in a federal prison.
Smart, now 28 years old, is married and a mother with a family of her own. Her daughter, Chloe is now 20 months old.

Now as a parent herself, Smart has realized how horrible the kidnapping was for her parents.
‚ÄúWhen I go back to my own situation, I almost think it was worse for my parents than for me because I knew that I was alive, but they didn‚Äôt know,‚Äù she told People magazine.
‚ÄúI always knew how much they loved me, but until I had my own daughter I didn‚Äôt realize how all-consuming that is. The worst thing in the world would be if something happened to my little girl,‚Äù she continued.
Smart has made it her life‚Äôs work as a reporter, teacher and activist to make sure other parents, families, victims and survivors are supported, ‚ÄúNobody should have to go through the aftermath of a terrible crime alone.‚Äù

After the release of a WikiLeaks email chain from March 2015 on Tuesday in which a top Clinton aide admitted President Barack Obama falsely claimed he did not know about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private server use while she was secretary of state, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue.
‚ÄúWhat the president said was an entirely factual response,‚Äù Earnest said to a group of reporters in Los Angeles where Obama was attending Democratic fundraisers.
Earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the president‚Äôs actions as mere conspiracies.

He continued, ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny, so I guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies.‚Äù
Obama himself denied any knowledge of the server, telling CBS reporter Bill Plante in March 2015, just after the server revelations that he learned of the Clinton‚Äôs private email server ‚Äúthe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.‚Äù
 
Several days after the server revelations in March 2015, Earnest told the press that Obama knew about Clinton‚Äôs email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server.
He reiterated that position on Tuesday.
‚ÄúThe president did trade emails with Secretary Clinton, not a large number of them,‚Äù Earnest said.
‚ÄúOf course the president had possession of Secretary Clinton‚Äôs email address, but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.‚Äù

‚Äú[L]ooks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news,‚Äù Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said in a March 7, 2015 email published Tuesday by WikiLeaks.

He doesn't bother to even check the facts to make sure that the is telling the truth. This is just another instance of this. We need to ask other questions. Was he sending unsecured emails to HRC? He would need a different S/MIME certificate to send an encrypted email to HRC than the one for addresses because HRC wouldn't have the private key for the State Department certificate. So, we have to presume that he knew that he was sending unsecured emial to HRC. The location of the server is a Red Herring. It was somewhere in cyberspace. What matters is that it was that she was using a private email account that appeared to be unsecured. The fact that it was unsecured is the major point here. If it had been properly secured with digital cryptography, it wouldn't have really mattered if it was in her home at least as far as national securty was concerned.;english;2016-10-26T22:46:37.603+03:00;westernjournalism.com;US;829.0;WH Press Secretary Says Obama's Denial About Clinton Server Was 'Entirely Factual';0.0;http://static.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/earnest-obama.jpg;43;43;0;0;0;bias

The state of Georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the Department of Public Health after it investigated what he said in his church. 
But Dr. Eric Walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. 
The state‚Äôs demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by Walsh against the Department of Health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. 
He‚Äôs getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by Houston officials for copies of his sermons. 
Walsh‚Äôs ordeal began in May 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. Only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
Lee Rudd, the agency‚Äôs human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the YouTube recordings immediately. Two days later, Walsh was fired. 
At that point, lawyers with First Liberty Institute joined forces with the Atlanta legal team of Parks, Chesin & Walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. 
‚ÄúPolice State USA: How Orwell‚Äôs Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality‚Äù chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today! 
Now, in response to Walsh‚Äôs lawsuit, the state delivered a ‚ÄúRequest for Production of Documents‚Äù that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, ‚Äúcopies of his sermon notes and transcripts.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThis is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church,‚Äù said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel for First Liberty. 
‚ÄúNo government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons,‚Äù said Walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. ‚ÄúI cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so.‚Äù 
Officials with the Georgia Department of Health declined to respond to a WND request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
Walsh‚Äôs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. 
On the guest list was Pastor Dave Welch of Houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. 
WND broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when Rush Limbaugh described Parker‚Äôs actions as possibly ‚Äúone of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the Constitution that I have seen.‚Äù 
The mayor at the time, Annise Parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . 
In a prepared statement Wednesday on Walsh‚Äôs case, Welch said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this, but Georgia‚Äôs demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from ‚Ä¶ us.‚Äù 
Welch, the executive director of the Texas Pastor Council, said what is happening to Walsh is ‚Äúworse than what happened in Houston for multiple reasons.‚Äù 
‚ÄúFirst, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlso, the state is demanding much more material: sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastor‚Äôs preaching Bible. It‚Äôs almost as if they are ransacking the pastor‚Äôs study. This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in America.‚Äù 
Leaders of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, part of the nation‚Äôs largest public policy women‚Äôs group with 500,000 members, also came to Walsh‚Äôs defense. 
Penny Nance, CEO, said: ‚ÄúThe words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that, ‚ÄòInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,‚Äô still reverberate today ‚Äì especially as we witness the ‚ÄòGestapo-like‚Äô tactics of his native state. The state of Georgia‚Äôs blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, Dr. Eric Walsh, is indeed a threat to every American, whatever our religious beliefs. 
‚ÄúCan there be a clearer violation of our First Amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share?‚Äù 
WND reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed Walsh‚Äôs sermons and then fired him. 
‚ÄúNo one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon,‚Äù Dys told Fox News when the case was filed. ‚ÄúHe was fired for something he said in a sermon. If the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything.‚Äù The original state investigation of Walsh‚Äôs sermons apparently was sparked by ‚Äúone complaint‚Äù from an official with a county Democratic Party and ‚Äúgay activist.‚Äù 
State officials also joked about informing Walsh of his firing. 
The telephone call was between Dr. Patrick O‚ÄôNeal, an agency official, and Kate Pfirman, an agency financial officer. The call was captured on an answering machine, which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up. 
Pfirman said: ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm gonna be very ‚Äì I‚Äôm gonna try to come off as very cold, because I don‚Äôt want to say very much. If I try to make it warm ‚Äì I‚Äôve thought that through, it‚Äôs gonna just not ‚Äì there‚Äôs no warm way to say it anyway.‚Äù 
Then there was laughter from both parties. 
O‚ÄôNeal then said to inform Walsh, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out,‚Äù and there was another round of laughter. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very funny,‚Äù Pfirman said.

Jesus Christ of Nazareth is not the Republican nominee for president in this election cycle. 
But if He were, Democrats would try to ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù Him in the same manner they‚Äôre attacking the 2016 GOP candidate, Donald Trump. 
That‚Äôs according to radio host Rush Limbaugh, who hypothesized what this year‚Äôs race would look like if the Son of God were at the top of the Republican ticket. 
Should President Trump try to prosecute Hillary? Sign the hottest petition in America now to show your support! 
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who the Republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment Trump‚Äôs getting. It wouldn‚Äôt have mattered,‚Äù Limbaugh said Wednesday. 
‚ÄúThey would go out of their way to find ways to destroy Jesus Christ if he could be nominated as a Republican. The Democrats would do everything they could, include calling Him a liar, the Bible a fake book, whatever it took.‚Äù Rush Limbaugh 
And despite the fact the Bible never indicates Jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, Limbaugh suggested Democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of His offspring: 
‚ÄúThey would scour the historical record looking for children He had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit Jesus. That‚Äôs who they are. That‚Äôs what they would do.‚Äù 
Limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that Republicans would never escape ‚Äúthis kind of media assault based on who we nominate.‚Äù Donald Trump‚Äôs RNC acceptance speech (Photo: Screenshot from RNC live feed) 
‚ÄúI say this because a lot of you Never Trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like Trump. No, it‚Äôs exactly what you get when you nominate a Republican. Whenever there is any opposition to the Democrats, this is what they do. It doesn‚Äôt matter. They‚Äôre gonna do it. They did it to Romney ‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve made this point ‚Äôtil I blue in the face. They turned Romney, who is mild-mannered Mr. Gosh, Can‚Äôt Even Get Noticed into the biggest walking Satan, El Diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick So this is why I think Trump has so many people supporting him. He‚Äôs fighting back against it when most Republicans haven‚Äôt and don‚Äôt.‚Äù 
As an example of how media treatment of Republicans has not changed, Limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from CBS. Commentator Bill Moyers characterized the race before it was known that Republican Ronald Reagan would easily defeat Democrat Jimmy Carter. Moyers stated: 
‚ÄúThose of you who might speak Spanish, who might be black, who might be women, remember,‚Äù said Carter, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs been your friend.‚Äù And there under the California sun in San Diego at a shopping center, Ronald Reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which he‚Äôs been a master since his days at Eureka College. Suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their ERA signs. Reagan took his cue and snapped back, ‚ÄúAw, shut up!‚Äù 
And thousands of supporters roared their approval. Those are the people for whom Ronald Reagan is the apostle of the rollback, the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government. Jimmy Carter won four years ago as an outsider, and, if he wins at all tonight, it must be as an insider defending the status quo. Reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting, ‚ÄúEnough‚Äôs enough.‚Äù 
‚ÄúDoes it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world?‚Äù Limbaugh asked. ‚ÄúNot an iota!‚Äù

A Hillary Clinton-supporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a $20,000 donation funneled through a Belize bank to use in this year‚Äôs presidential election campaign ‚Äì until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by James O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs Project Veritas Action. 
Suddenly, the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donation‚Äôs overseas origin and decided to return it. 
That‚Äôs one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by O‚ÄôKeefe called ‚ÄúRigging the Election.‚Äù 
O‚ÄôKeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with Bob Creamer, who was a staffer at Americans United for Change, a group supporting Clinton for president, until the videos started appearing last week. 
He said Creamer, who boasted of working directly for the Clinton campaign, directed that the $20,000 donation go to AUFC ‚Äúto disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops.‚Äù 
O‚ÄôKeefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves. 
Creamer was clear about his ties to Clinton, stating, ‚ÄúEvery morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters.‚Äù 
Sign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump‚Äôs call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! 
Project Veritas‚Äô first video explained how the Clinton campaign uses ‚Äúhidden connections‚Äù to incite violence at Donald Trump rallies. Its second video showed plans for step-by-step voter fraud and the third exposed ‚Äúprohibited communications‚Äù between Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign, ‚Äúthe DNC and the nonprofit Americans United for Change.‚Äù 
The fourth video ‚Äúbreaks down the process of the long-term investigation.‚Äù It comes after Creamer‚Äôs announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. 
O‚ÄôKeefe and Project Veritas Action have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. 
Among the revelations in the latest video was Creamer was boasting of his close links to President Obama. 
‚ÄúOh, Barack Obama‚Äôs was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good, too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a pro, I‚Äôve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago.‚Äù 
When asked whether a potential donor could meet Obama, Creamer said: ‚ÄúOK, you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in 98 days, 97. I was just at an event with him in Chicago, Friday of last week, he is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the ‚Ä¶ the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.‚Äù 
Explained Project Veritas: ‚ÄúThe more that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get. Project Veritas Action‚Äôs $20,000 investment paid off. The story was solid. Robert Creamer, Scott Foval, Jenna Price from the DNC, Brad Woodhouse from AUFC, Cesar Vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous PVA videos.‚Äù 
In the first video, Foval, a Democratic operative, boasted of what he called ‚Äúconflict engagement,‚Äù or sending protesters to disrupt Trump events. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre starting anarchy here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd he needs to understand that we‚Äôre starting anarchy.‚Äù 
In the second video, Creamer explained Clinton‚Äôs direct control over those disruption operations. 
‚ÄúIn the end it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future President of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground, so by god we would get ducks on the ground,‚Äù Creamer said. 
Creamer, the husband of Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, has starred in several of the undercover videos. 
Here‚Äôs the third: 
That video also revealed a direct conflict between what Creamer was confirming ‚Äì Clinton‚Äôs active involvement in such decisions and campaigns ‚Äì and the claim of her campaign manager, Robby Mook. 
Mook told CNN over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and Clinton. 
Sign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump‚Äôs call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! 
‚ÄúThese individuals no longer have a relationship with the DNC,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve never had a relationship with the Clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened I think in February of last year. 
‚ÄúThey did not have a contract with the DNC until June. But putting all that aside, this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign, it is edited so we don‚Äôt know what the full context is. And there‚Äôs no evidence whatsoever ‚Ä¶ that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the DNC.‚Äù 
His comments: 
After confirming it was Clinton or ‚Äúwanted ducks on the ground,‚Äù Creamer warned undercover Project Veritas journalists, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt repeat that to anybody.‚Äù 
Creamer ran Democracy Partners, a consulting company with ties to Clinton. 
He has been to the White House 342 times while Obama has been president, including 47 meetings directly with Obama. 
O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs organization reported that the coordination between the campaign, the DNC and the Americans United for Change ‚Äúsmacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures.‚Äù 
Last week , Project Veritas filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission asking for an investigation into the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúcriminal conspiracy.‚Äù 
The filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which Democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means, such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally. 
The video have resulted already in two Democratic operatives losing their jobs. 
Editor‚Äôs Note: Be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos. 
One is Scott Foval, who had worked for People for the American Way, a George Soros-funded group, and more recently with Americans United for Change. 
In the video, he said: ‚ÄúYou know what? We‚Äôve been busing people in to deal with you f‚Äîing a‚Äî‚Äìes for 50 years, and we‚Äôre not going to stop now.‚Äù 
Also, he said he and his agents are ‚Äústarting anarchy‚Äù by creating ‚Äúconflict engagement ‚Ä¶ in the lines at Trump rallies.‚Äù 
Also out of work is Creamer. 
See the second video: 
Talk-radio icon Rush Limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome. 
‚ÄúEvery Trump rally would feature none of this [violence] unless the Democrats were paying for it. I think it‚Äôs a big deal, folks. The media is complicit. They know who these people are. ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre in on it. They‚Äôre part of the game. ‚Ä¶ None of it‚Äôs organic. None of it‚Äôs natural. None of it‚Äôs real. Every bit of it is bought and paid for. 
‚Äú[Democrats] can‚Äôt leave elections to chance because they know that, despite the way it may look, the majority of Americans would not support them if they knew who they are.‚Äù

Jesus Christ of Nazareth is not the Republican nominee for president in this election cycle. 
But if He were, Democrats would try to ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù Him in the same manner they‚Äôre attacking the 2016 GOP candidate, Donald Trump. 
That‚Äôs according to radio host Rush Limbaugh, who hypothesized what this year‚Äôs race would look like if the Son of God were at the top of the Republican ticket. 
Should President Trump try to prosecute Hillary? Sign the hottest petition in America now to show your support! 
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter who the Republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment Trump‚Äôs getting. It wouldn‚Äôt have mattered,‚Äù Limbaugh said Wednesday. 
‚ÄúThey would go out of their way to find ways to destroy Jesus Christ if he could be nominated as a Republican. The Democrats would do everything they could, include calling Him a liar, the Bible a fake book, whatever it took.‚Äù Rush Limbaugh 
And despite the fact the Bible never indicates Jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, Limbaugh suggested Democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of His offspring: 
‚ÄúThey would scour the historical record looking for children He had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit Jesus. That‚Äôs who they are. That‚Äôs what they would do.‚Äù 
Limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that Republicans would never escape ‚Äúthis kind of media assault based on who we nominate.‚Äù Donald Trump‚Äôs RNC acceptance speech (Photo: Screenshot from RNC live feed) 
‚ÄúI say this because a lot of you Never Trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like Trump. No, it‚Äôs exactly what you get when you nominate a Republican. Whenever there is any opposition to the Democrats, this is what they do. It doesn‚Äôt matter. They‚Äôre gonna do it. They did it to Romney ‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve made this point ‚Äôtil I blue in the face. They turned Romney, who is mild-mannered Mr. Gosh, Can‚Äôt Even Get Noticed into the biggest walking Satan, El Diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick So this is why I think Trump has so many people supporting him. He‚Äôs fighting back against it when most Republicans haven‚Äôt and don‚Äôt.‚Äù 
As an example of how media treatment of Republicans has not changed, Limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from CBS. Commentator Bill Moyers characterized the race before it was known that Republican Ronald Reagan would easily defeat Democrat Jimmy Carter. Moyers stated:

Theodore Roosevelt was born Oct. 27, 1858. His wife and mother died on Valentine‚Äôs Day, Feb. 14, 1884. He wrote in his diary ‚ÄúThe light has gone out in my life.‚Äù Depressed, he left to ranch in the Dakotas. 
Returning to New York, he entered politics and rose to assistant secretary of the Navy. He resigned during the Spanish-American War, organized the first Volunteer Cavalry, ‚Äúthe Rough Riders,‚Äù and captured Cuba‚Äôs San Juan Hill. Elected Vice-President under William McKinley, he became America‚Äôs youngest president in 1901. 
Republican Theodore Roosevelt was the first president to invite an African-American, Booker T. Washington, to dine in the White House on Oct. 16, 1901. A Southern Democrat newspapers condemned him it, as printed in the Memphis Scimitar: ‚ÄúThe most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the United States was committed yesterday by the President, when he invited a n- to dine with him at the White House. It would not be worth more than a passing notice if Theodore Roosevelt had sat down to dinner in his own home with a Pullman car porter, but Roosevelt the individual and Roosevelt the president are not to be viewed in the same light.‚Äù 
In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt warned: ‚ÄúThe thought of modern industry in the hands of Christian charity is a dream worth dreaming. The thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining. The choice between the two is upon us.‚Äù 
In 1917, the New York Bible Society had Theodore Roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket New Testament & Book of Psalms given to World War I soldiers: ‚ÄúThe teachings of the New Testament are foreshadowed in Micah‚Äôs verse (Micah vi. 8): ‚ÄòWhat more does the Lord require of thee than to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?‚Äô Do justice; and therefore fight valiantly against the armies of Germany and Turkey, for these nations in this crisis stand for the reign of Moloch and Beelzebub on this earth. Love mercy; treat prisoners well, succor the wounded, treat every woman as if she was your sister, care for the little children, and be tender to the old and helpless. Walk humbly; You will do so if you study the life and teachings of the Saviour. May the God of justice and mercy have you in His keeping. ‚Äì (signed) Theodore Roosevelt.‚Äù

Theodore Roosevelt, in his book ‚ÄúFear God and Take Your Own Part‚Äù (NY: George H. Doran Co., 1916), wrote: 
Armenians ‚Ä¶ for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war ‚Ä¶ are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors, the Turks, have not been pacifists but militarists. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, p. 61, 64) 
Armenians, have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the Napoleonic Wars‚Ä¶the wars of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane in Asia. Yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged. ‚Ä¶ This course of national infamy ‚Ä¶ began when the last Administration surrendered to the peace at-any-price people, and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties. Individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milk-and-water invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of blood-and-iron. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, p. 111) 
American eye-witness of the fearful atrocities, Mr. Arthur H. Gleason (New York Tribune, Nov. 25, 1915)‚Ä¶ Serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish. Now, the Armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an old-time Apache Indian. ‚Ä¶ 
Even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heaped-up horrors of the past year and a half, the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the Armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation. Let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation, and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds. ‚Ä¶ If this people through its government had not shirked its duty ‚Ä¶ we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of Armenia. 
Mass meetings on behalf of the Armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them. ‚Ä¶ The principles of the peace-at-any-price men, of the professional pacifists ‚Ä¶ will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness. ‚Ä¶ This crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the Armenians ‚Ä¶ must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the United States for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed. ‚Ä¶ The devastation of Poland and Serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenth-century Europe. ‚Ä¶ 
Weak and timid milk-and-water policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the blood-and-iron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world. The crowning outrage has been committed by the Turks on the Armenians. They have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them, atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of Attila and of Genghis Khan. 
It is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks ‚Äòneutral not only in deed but in thought,‚Äô between right and the most hideous wrong, neutral between despairing and hunted people, people whose little children are murdered and their women raped, and the victorious and evil wrong-doers. ‚Ä¶ 
I trust that all Americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful Armenian atrocities. I trust that they feel ‚Ä¶ that a peace obtained without ‚Ä¶ righting the wrongs of the Armenians would be worse than any war. ‚Ä¶ 
Wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just, who put honor above safety, who are true to a lofty ideal of duty, who prepare in advance to make their strength effective, and who shrink from no hazard, not even the final hazard of war, if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness. When our people take this stand, we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesses‚Ä¶on an even greater scale in Armenia. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, pp. 377-383) 
In his book ‚ÄúFear God and Take Your Part,‚Äù 1916, Theodore Roosevelt wrote: 
Christianity is not the creed of Asia and Africa at this moment solely because the seventh century Christians of Asia and Africa had trained themselves not to fight, whereas the Moslems were trained to fight. Christianity was saved in Europe solely because the peoples of Europe fought. 
If the peoples of Europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and on up to and including the 17th century, had not possessed a military equality with, and gradually a growing superiority over the Mohammedans who invaded Europe, Europe would at this moment be Mohammedan and the Christian religion would be exterminated. 
A contemporary of Theodore Roosevelt was the English author G.K. Chesterton, who wrote of Western Christian civilization (‚ÄúThe Collected Works of G.K. Chesterton: Volume XX,‚Äù Introduction and Notes by James V. Schall, Ignatius Press): ‚ÄúThey seem entirely to forget that long before the Crusaders had dreamed of riding to Jerusalem, the Moslems had almost ridden into Paris.‚Äù 
Theodore Roosevelt continued in ‚ÄúFear God and Take Your Part,‚Äù 1916: ‚ÄúWherever the Mohammedans have had complete sway, wherever the Christians have been unable to resist them by the sword, Christianity has ultimately disappeared. From the hammer of Charles Martel to the sword of Jan Sobieski, Christianity owed its safety in Europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the Mohammedan aggressor.‚Äù

Theodore Roosevelt was born Oct. 27, 1858. His wife and mother died on Valentine‚Äôs Day, Feb. 14, 1884. He wrote in his diary ‚ÄúThe light has gone out in my life.‚Äù Depressed, he left to ranch in the Dakotas. 
Returning to New York, he entered politics and rose to assistant secretary of the Navy. He resigned during the Spanish-American War, organized the first Volunteer Cavalry, ‚Äúthe Rough Riders,‚Äù and captured Cuba‚Äôs San Juan Hill. Elected Vice-President under William McKinley, he became America‚Äôs youngest president in 1901. 
Republican Theodore Roosevelt was the first president to invite an African-American, Booker T. Washington, to dine in the White House on Oct. 16, 1901. A Southern Democrat newspapers condemned him it, as printed in the Memphis Scimitar: ‚ÄúThe most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the United States was committed yesterday by the President, when he invited a n- to dine with him at the White House. It would not be worth more than a passing notice if Theodore Roosevelt had sat down to dinner in his own home with a Pullman car porter, but Roosevelt the individual and Roosevelt the president are not to be viewed in the same light.‚Äù 
In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt warned: ‚ÄúThe thought of modern industry in the hands of Christian charity is a dream worth dreaming. The thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining. The choice between the two is upon us.‚Äù 
In 1917, the New York Bible Society had Theodore Roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket New Testament & Book of Psalms given to World War I soldiers: ‚ÄúThe teachings of the New Testament are foreshadowed in Micah‚Äôs verse (Micah vi. 8): ‚ÄòWhat more does the Lord require of thee than to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?‚Äô Do justice; and therefore fight valiantly against the armies of Germany and Turkey, for these nations in this crisis stand for the reign of Moloch and Beelzebub on this earth. Love mercy; treat prisoners well, succor the wounded, treat every woman as if she was your sister, care for the little children, and be tender to the old and helpless. Walk humbly; You will do so if you study the life and teachings of the Saviour. May the God of justice and mercy have you in His keeping. ‚Äì (signed) Theodore Roosevelt.‚Äù

Theodore Roosevelt, in his book ‚ÄúFear God and Take Your Own Part‚Äù (NY: George H. Doran Co., 1916), wrote: 
Armenians ‚Ä¶ for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war ‚Ä¶ are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors, the Turks, have not been pacifists but militarists. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, p. 61, 64) 
Armenians, have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the Napoleonic Wars‚Ä¶the wars of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane in Asia. Yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged. ‚Ä¶ This course of national infamy ‚Ä¶ began when the last Administration surrendered to the peace at-any-price people, and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties. Individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milk-and-water invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of blood-and-iron. (T. Roosevelt, Fear God, p. 111) 
American eye-witness of the fearful atrocities, Mr. Arthur H. Gleason (New York Tribune, Nov. 25, 1915)‚Ä¶ Serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish. Now, the Armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an old-time Apache Indian. ‚Ä¶ 
Even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heaped-up horrors of the past year and a half, the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the Armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation. Let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation, and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds. ‚Ä¶ If this people through its government had not shirked its duty ‚Ä¶ we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of Armenia. 
Mass meetings on behalf of the Armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them. ‚Ä¶ The principles of the peace-at-any-price men, of the professional pacifists ‚Ä¶ will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness. ‚Ä¶ This crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the Armenians ‚Ä¶ must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the United States for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed. ‚Ä¶ The devastation of Poland and Serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenth-century Europe. ‚Ä¶ 
Weak and timid milk-and-water policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the blood-and-iron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world. The crowning outrage has been committed by the Turks on the Armenians. They have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them, atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of Attila and of Genghis Khan. 
It is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks ‚Äòneutral not only in deed but in thought,‚Äô between right and the most hideous wrong, neutral between despairing and hunted people, people whose little children are murdered and their women raped, and the victorious and evil wrong-doers. ‚Ä¶

Have you ever noticed how Washington always has a plan to solve everybody‚Äôs problem ‚Äì except their own? 
For the federal government, it‚Äôs always easy and tempting to look at problems ‚Äì real or imagined ‚Äì outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. 
You will recall, of course, how former Attorney General Eric Holder was going to stop police shootings all over America with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. 
Now Loretta Lynch, his successor, also known as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout America into big business and more power for Washington. 
Her latest pet project is assembling a national database on ‚Äúinteractions between law enforcement and civilians,‚Äù she reported this month. 
‚ÄúAccurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations,‚Äù Lynch said. ‚ÄúIn the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve.‚Äù 
The irony here is thick, indeed. 
One of Lynch‚Äôs goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. 
Meanwhile, Lynch presides over the most egregious cover-up of the most outrageous police shooting case I have ever seen in my life ‚Äì namely the killing of Miriam Carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by Washington cops and Secret Service agents for a wrong turn in the nation‚Äôs capital. 
Lynch wants reports? 
So does WND, which has been pursuing the information through Freedom of Information Act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. 
So does the public and the family of Miriam Carey. Unfortunately, Lynch is holding back on a few things: Missing Evidence The 92-page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the Carey shooting investigation. This would show the evidence and reasoning that led the Department of Justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. Why they considered this a justifiable homicide ‚Äì or whether they should have, based on the evidence. Why officers used deadly force. Whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. Video of shooting at Capitol Police guard post at intersection of Constitution Ave., Maryland Ave. and 2nd Street. Only stills have been released. Video would show more clearly if officer‚Äôs life actually was in danger, as DOJ claimed, when he fired fatal shot to Carey‚Äôs head. Not one of the five witnesses at the scene said Carey was driving at the officer, as the DOJ claimed. Police statements The police report said four officers fired shots at Carey, two from the Capitol Police and two from the Secret Service. Not one statement from those officers was in the report. Their names were also redacted. Redacted information An attorney in the Washington, D.C., mayor‚Äôs office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. It turned out much more was redacted than names. The report was riddled with blacked-out sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. Some of the blacked-out pages just included a heading marked ‚ÄúEvidence.‚Äù Some just had a date. Witness statements An astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. The police report stated: ‚ÄúThere were seventy-two (72) witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio and/or video recordings. Copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the USAO for review. Copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the Technical Support Unit (TSU) located at the IAD.‚Äù Of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to WND, leaving 38 missing. Statement transcripts None of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses‚Äô own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former NYPD officer Sanders described as ‚Äúcop talk.‚Äù White House guard post video Stills were released but not the video. It would show whether anyone was manning the post when Carey drove up; whether she tried to drive around the off-duty guard who dragged a gate in front of her; and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. Police radio recordings No recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of Carey were provided in the FOIA material. Also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions (instant messaging) between squad cars and police headquarters. Ballistics and forensics reports The Justice Department Washington Metro Police Department responses to FOIA requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. 
I could go on and on. For people who want facts and reports, the U.S. Justice Department under both Holder and Lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. 
We‚Äôve been at this for a long time ‚Äì years. Yet the stonewall and cover-up of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. 
Do we really expect Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that?

The same holds true for many evangelicals. Democrats and secularists count on it. 
And we never disappoint. 
Full disclosure: I went from a dogged ‚ÄúNever Trumper‚Äù to a ‚ÄúMaybe Trumper‚Äù and, finally, settled as a ‚ÄúReluctant Trumper.‚Äù I, like any God-fearing father of daughters was, and remain, appalled by Donald Trump‚Äôs sordid past, and his 11-year-old vulgar video in which he objectified women. His words are indefensible, and I fully expect the Clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the Republican nominee before Election Day. 
Still, I will be voting against Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible: by casting a vote, for better or worse, for the policies and promises of Donald Trump ‚Äì and for the vice presidency of Gov. Mike Pence. 
Regrettably, with many of my Never Trump friends I‚Äôm reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself (and others) of the strength of his own faith. Pride is an awful thing. We are to be ‚Äúwise as serpents and innocent as doves‚Äù (Matthew 10:16). Foolishness called ‚Äúfaith‚Äù is just foolishness. 
Even so, there are Christian Pharisees on both extremes of this Trump fiasco: first, those Trumpian cultists who buy the ‚ÄúMake America great again!‚Äù pablum and deride any person who, while not casting judgment upon others, makes, with all sincerity, what they view as the principled decision. The latter say they‚Äôll sit this one out (or go through the motions by voting third party ‚Äì a wasted vote by any objective standard). While I appreciate this milder strain of Never Trumper‚Äôs sincerity, I nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong. 
And then there are the self-righteous, plank-in-the-eye Never Trump prigs who slander as having ‚Äúlost their saltiness,‚Äù‚Äúsinned against God‚Äù and ‚Äúcompromised their principles,‚Äù brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed (Lord knows I‚Äôm the worst sinner of all) baby Christian as president is a vote against Hillary Clinton‚Äôs tyranny in perpetuity. 
The Media Research Center has done America a tremendous service. In 2014 the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion ‚Äì something Hillary Clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate, stared into the camera with cold, callous eyes, and then both lied about and defended unequivocally. I plead with Never Trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for Nov. 8. 
Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs beloved late-term abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the left-leaning American Medical Association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances, not the least of which is for ‚Äúthe life or health of the mother.‚Äù 
During a partial-birth abortion, the abortionist pulls a fully ‚Äúviable‚Äù child ‚Äì often kicking and thrashing ‚Äì feet first from her mother‚Äôs womb, leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal. This is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion, rather than committing murder. 
He then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors, piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt. Next, he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands, inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains, thereby collapsing her skull. 
Her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage. 
This is homicide, plain and simple. Hillary Clinton supports it. Donald Trump opposes it. 
We deserve God‚Äôs wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch. In my estimation, Mrs. Clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity. Her Supreme Court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner. 
My conscience tells me that I must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against Mrs. Clinton and ensure that she is stopped. She must not be elected president. To not vote ‚Äì or to vote for a non-starter third party candidate, which is effectively the same thing ‚Äì while not an actual vote for Mrs. Clinton, still puts this Mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the White House and the Supreme Court. 
It‚Äôs simple math, and it‚Äôs undeniable. The most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against Mrs. Clinton by voting for Mr. Trump. This does the most electoral damage possible to candidate Clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations. 
With its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the U.S. Supreme Court put the government‚Äôs official stamp of approval on mass murder. Since then, the battle lines have been drawn. This is war. ‚ÄúPro-choicers‚Äù are the bad guys and pro-lifers, the good guys. It really is that simple ‚Äì that black and white. It‚Äôs good versus evil. 
History will reflect as much. 
Under a President Hillary Clinton, millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive. Under a President Donald Trump, these millions might live. And yet, even as Hillary sharpens her knives, we quibble like fools over Donald‚Äôs potty mouth.

Our country is at a crossroads. Never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. One road, the one favored by politician Hillary Clinton and her Democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. The other, favored by businessman Donald Trump and some of his Republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward free-market capitalism. 
It is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. In this system they control the lion‚Äôs share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. In this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. As the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. Statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hard-earned money he or she spends. Yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. 
We‚Äôve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the free-market system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. No, it isn‚Äôt perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. 
Notice what I didn‚Äôt say is ‚Äúsimply willing to work hard.‚Äù There is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù ‚Äì the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around $85,000 a year in some parts of the country. The Democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. That completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder Americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. 
Ideally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. 
Unfortunately, this so-called living wage will destroy jobs. It will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. 
But this living wage is only part of what the Democrats want to do in the name of fairness. 
This, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. 
Wages have remained flat for far too long, but the Democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. 
Most people simply do not understand that businesses don‚Äôt pay taxes. They are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. And when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as we‚Äôve seen in Obamacare, there is a large outcry. That‚Äôs when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. That‚Äôs when the door to socialism/communism slams shut. 
They tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. Our benevolent government will take care of us. They are offering us free college ‚Äì or almost free loans ‚Äì in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. And if we don‚Äôt get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. Under President Hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. What a country! 
If we don‚Äôt reach our goals, everything will be OK because Social Security and Medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isn‚Äôt enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. 
What about the fact that Social Security and Medicare are going broke? How long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses? They never talk about that. 
As British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, ‚ÄúThe problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people‚Äôs money.‚Äù 
Don‚Äôt be fooled: This election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. It‚Äôs an important fork in the road: One fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. The other offers a free lunch.

Before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out, allow me to explain my decision to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. 
First, I‚Äôm writing this because I have been asked incessantly for months how I would be voting, not because I think I‚Äôm someone special or that what I do should influence you. 
Second, I‚Äôm not endorsing Donald Trump. In my mind, there‚Äôs a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate. 
Third, I respect those in the #NeverTrump camp and share many of their concerns, including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation, the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides, and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies, just to name a few. Among the #NeverTrump voices I respect are columnists like David French and Ben Shapiro, bloggers like Matt Walsh and evangelical leaders like Russell Moore and Beth Moore. 
Fourth, I take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over Trump as if he were some kind of savior figure, supporting him as if he were St. Donald. I also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of Trump‚Äôs failings, constantly saying, ‚ÄúLet him who is without sin cast the first one‚Äù (see John 8:7). This is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation. 
Fifth, my decision to vote for Trump, barring something earth-shattering between now and Nov. 8, is consistent with my position, which has been: 1) During the GOP primaries, I issued strong warnings against voting for Trump while we had other excellent choices. I did this in writing , on video and on the radio, but always stating that if Trump won the nomination, I would re-evaluate my position. 2) Once Trump became the Republican candidate, I wrote that I was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote. 3) I have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would I vote for Hillary. (For two strong warnings about Hillary, see here and here .) 
So, what has convinced me that I should now vote for Donald Trump? 
The culture war is not over! Gain hope, courage and practical advice in Michael Brown‚Äôs latest book, ‚ÄúOutlasting the Gay Revolution: Where Homosexual Activism Is Really Going and How to Turn the Tide‚Äù 
First, I believe that he actually is serious about appointing pro-life, pro-Constitution Supreme Court justices. When he said during the last debate that if you‚Äôre pro-life, you want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and when he reiterated at his Gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of 20 potential appointees, he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flip-flop if elected. 
Second, one reason I endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz was because he took on the political establishment, both Democratic and Republican, to the point of calling it the Washington cartel. Trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system (although, unfortunately, he‚Äôs been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system), so my vote for him is also a protest vote. 
Third, I am voting for the Republican platform, not the Republican Party, which means I‚Äôm in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole. 
Fourth, while I have always felt that the line, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre electing a president, not a pastor,‚Äù was overstated and superficial, if we rephrased it to say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre electing a general to train hand-to-hand combat warriors, not a pastor,‚Äù it might have more relevance. In other words, we are not looking for Trump to be a moral reformer (even if hedoes appoint righteous judges), and, at this point, he certainly is anything but a moral example (although we pray he will be truly converted and become one). Rather, out of our choices for president, which are stark, we are voting for the one most likely to defeat Hillary and make some good decisions for the nation, not be the savior. And with things so messed up in America, the hand-to-hand combat analogy is closer to home. 
Fifth, within the first few minutes of the last debate, the massive differences between Hillary and Trump were there for the world to see, she a pro-abortion radical and an extreme supporter of the LGBT agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against late-term abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties. Since I have the opportunity to vote, I feel that I should vote for Trump. 
Sixth, Trump continues to be drawn to conservative Christians, and not just ones who tickle his ears. One of my dear friends has spent hours with Trump and members of his family, and he has told me that in 55 years of ministry, no one has received him as openly and graciously as has Trump. Yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms. While I am not one of those claiming that Trump is a born-again Christian (I see absolutely no evidence of this), the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on. It also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president. 
Seventh, although I‚Äôm quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation, I‚Äôm far more concerned with what we as God‚Äôs people do with our own lives and witnesses, and for me, the state of the church of America is much more important than the state of the White House. In that context, I echo the words (and warning) of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: ‚ÄúThe church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. It must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool. If the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority.‚Äù 
So, in sum: 1) My hope is in God, not Donald Trump, and I do recognize that either Hillary or Trump has the potential to do great harm to America; 2) My urgent call is for us as followers of Jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation; 3) I will continue to urge all believers not to vote for Hillary Clinton, whose policies will certainly do us great harm; and 4) Ultimately, the most effective way to defeat Hillary is to vote for Trump, while also praying that God will use him for good , not for evil. 
In the end, if Trump gets elected and fails miserably, I will be grieved but not devastated. If he does well, I will rejoice. 
Either way, though, my vote is just that: a vote. My greater role is to live a life pleasing to God with the hope of advancing a gospel-based moral and cultural revolution.

Every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
It doesn‚Äôt help that white voters can‚Äôt agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they‚Äôll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. 
The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats ‚Äì the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. 
The people who will be worse off are everybody else ‚Äì the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. 
Look to Mexico for your future ‚Äì or any Third World country. Or to Univision‚Äôs Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) 
Explaining Latino culture‚Äôs acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that ‚Äúthe male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. ‚Ä¶ Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.‚Äù 
One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an ‚Äúopen mind‚Äù about child rape because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a cultural thing.‚Äù 
When it comes to multiculturalism, you can‚Äôt say, We love the empanadas ‚Äì but we don‚Äôt want 40-year-old men raping their nieces . This isn‚Äôt an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures we‚Äôre importing. 
As described in excruciating detail in ‚ÄúAdios, America: The Left‚Äôs Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole,‚Äù our media already have a totally ‚Äúopen mind‚Äù about incest and child rape ‚Äì and murder! ‚Äì when it‚Äôs committed by immigrants. 
Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline: ‚ÄúIllegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape,‚Äù the Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press went with the less catchy: ‚ÄúMan guilty in case of human smuggling.‚Äù 
And where I would have used the headline, ‚ÄúIllegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14-year-old Girl at Job Site,‚Äù the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, ‚ÄúColumbus resident charged with molestation.‚Äù 
Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too ‚Äì provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. 
In 1989, Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from ‚Äútraditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood.‚Äù The female head of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. 
Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. (Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing!) 
In 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. 
When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. (That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants!) 
Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for ‚ÄúAustin men.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúTwo.‚Äù 
Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack: 
‚Äì ‚ÄúTwo held in attack on child‚Äù ‚Äì Austin American-Statesman (Texas), July 19, 2013 
‚Äì ‚ÄúTwo Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack‚Äù ‚Äì Daily Mail Online, July 24, 2013 
Needless to say, the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal-alien gang rape at all. 
The ultimate primer on the ‚Äúblue-collar billionaire‚Äù‚Äî order Ann Coulter‚Äôs book ‚ÄúIn Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!‚Äù 
By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape ‚Äì of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. 
The second case only was ‚Äúrape‚Äù because of the girl‚Äôs young age ‚Äì she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. 
Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. The defendants were African-American. The victim was Mexican. 
That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made the New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. 
Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. One suspect was African-American, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one? 
When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square (another one of Hillary‚Äôs foreign policy successes!), journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. 
Conclusion: The real problem was the female reporters‚Äô American bosses and colleagues. (Definitely not Islam!) 
Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logan‚Äôs rape: 
‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy We Need Women in War Zones‚Äù (‚ÄúI would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. ‚Ä¶ This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.‚Äù) 
‚Äì ‚ÄúReporting While Female‚Äù (‚ÄúWomen reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. ‚Ä¶ In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment.‚Äù) 
Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. 
Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans ‚Äì or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. (The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher.) 
Our country will be Zimbabwe, but ‚Äì if all goes according to the Democrats‚Äô plan ‚Äì they‚Äôll get to be Mugabe! 
That‚Äôs Hillary‚Äôs dream.

Two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered NFL fan. The game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. 
Democrats can be counted upon to call the Republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly Mitt Romney or the Supreme Court justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision. Donald Trump, you see, is ‚Äúracist‚Äù because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him ‚Äúmy African-American.‚Äù Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is not anti-Semitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husband‚Äôs former congressional campaign manager as a ‚Äúf‚Äì-ing Jew bastard.‚Äù 
With a Republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies ‚Äì big or small, real or imagined ‚Äì while giving the Democrat a pass. So Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfailure to ever apologize‚Äù outweighs an examination of Clinton‚Äôs flat-out lie during the third debate when she insisted that the Supreme Court Heller case was about ‚Äútoddlers,‚Äù as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. 
In Heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word ‚Äútoddler‚Äù appear. Clinton, a year ago, flat-out said, ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.‚Äù To normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. 
Meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an ‚Äúemail scandal,‚Äù when the accurate description is ‚Äúnational security scandal.‚Äù The Espionage Act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. The law does not require, as FBI Director James Comey falsely stated, an ‚Äúintent.‚Äù Nor is it relevant, as Clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was ‚Äúhacked.‚Äù 
Five people who worked with or for Clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. Some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. But the ‚Äútarget,‚Äù that is to say Hillary Clinton, was deemed by Comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. So why the immunity deals? Who knows ‚Äì and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares? 
Clinton insists that ‚ÄúPresident Obama doesn‚Äôt get enough credit‚Äù for the swell job he did with the economy. This would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. This would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that Gallup CEO Jim Clifton calls ‚Äúthe big lie,‚Äù given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are under-employed. 
Meanwhile, it‚Äôs yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by Trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist Gloria Allred. Allred, a Clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of Trump‚Äôs sexual misconduct and her support for Clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husband‚Äôs accusers. One such accuser, Juanita Broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by Bill Clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, Hillary Clinton verbally threatened her. 
Hillary Clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about Broaddrick‚Äôs allegation. Never. And only one national reporter, Sam Donaldson, has ever asked Bill Clinton about Juanita Broaddrick‚Äôs allegation. Ever. Clinton‚Äôs answer? He referred Donaldson to his lawyer, David Kendall. Donaldson quickly tried again, asking the then-president to ‚Äúsimply deny it.‚Äù Same answer: ‚ÄúMy attorney ‚Ä¶ speaks for me.‚Äù And that was that. 
So Hillary Clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy that‚Äôs given us the worst recovery since 1949; who has clearly violated the Espionage Act and placed the nation‚Äôs security at risk; who told the Benghazi victim‚Äôs families that the death of four Americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different; whose charitable foundation engaged in pay-to-play in Haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and non-donors went to the back of the line; who wants to gut the Second Amendment; who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of ISIS, Russia and the Chinese; and whose media compadres, including scribes with the New York Times, Washington Post and CNBC, have been outed by WikiLeaks as colluding with her campaign. And she is now odds-on favorite to become the next president of the United States.

As I outlined in last weekend‚Äôs column, we know that Clinton‚Äôs e-mails were replete with classified information. According to the FBI, the classified e-mails included intelligence graded at the most closely guarded level: eight top-secret e-mails, and seven designated as ‚Äúspecial access program‚Äù (SAP) information. (While FBI director James Comey‚Äôs presentation understandably left this vague, the likelihood is that seven of the eight top-secret e-mails are SAP.) Under President Bill Clinton‚Äôs 1995 executive order, top-secret intelligence is information the mishandling of which ‚Äúcould be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.‚Äù The SAP designation is added when the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence could compromise critical intelligence-gathering methods or imperil the lives of intelligence sources. 
That is why access to this information is so tightly restricted, and its unauthorized disclosure is routinely prosecuted.";english;2016-10-27T02:39:29.413+03:00;wnd.com;GB;1550.0;Clinton transmitted classified info to her lawyers;0.0;;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Have you ever noticed how Washington always has a plan to solve everybody‚Äôs problem ‚Äì except their own? 
For the federal government, it‚Äôs always easy and tempting to look at problems ‚Äì real or imagined ‚Äì outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. 
You will recall, of course, how former Attorney General Eric Holder was going to stop police shootings all over America with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. 
Now Loretta Lynch, his successor, also known as Hillary Clinton‚Äôs guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout America into big business and more power for Washington. 
Her latest pet project is assembling a national database on ‚Äúinteractions between law enforcement and civilians,‚Äù she reported this month. 
‚ÄúAccurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations,‚Äù Lynch said. ‚ÄúIn the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve.‚Äù 
The irony here is thick, indeed. 
One of Lynch‚Äôs goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. 
Meanwhile, Lynch presides over the most egregious cover-up of the most outrageous police shooting case I have ever seen in my life ‚Äì namely the killing of Miriam Carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by Washington cops and Secret Service agents for a wrong turn in the nation‚Äôs capital. 
Lynch wants reports? 
So does WND, which has been pursuing the information through Freedom of Information Act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. 
So does the public and the family of Miriam Carey. Unfortunately, Lynch is holding back on a few things: Missing Evidence The 92-page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the Carey shooting investigation. This would show the evidence and reasoning that led the Department of Justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. Why they considered this a justifiable homicide ‚Äì or whether they should have, based on the evidence. Why officers used deadly force. Whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. Video of shooting at Capitol Police guard post at intersection of Constitution Ave., Maryland Ave. and 2nd Street. Only stills have been released. Video would show more clearly if officer‚Äôs life actually was in danger, as DOJ claimed, when he fired fatal shot to Carey‚Äôs head. Not one of the five witnesses at the scene said Carey was driving at the officer, as the DOJ claimed. Police statements The police report said four officers fired shots at Carey, two from the Capitol Police and two from the Secret Service. Not one statement from those officers was in the report. Their names were also redacted. Redacted information An attorney in the Washington, D.C., mayor‚Äôs office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. It turned out much more was redacted than names. The report was riddled with blacked-out sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. Some of the blacked-out pages just included a heading marked ‚ÄúEvidence.‚Äù Some just had a date. Witness statements An astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. The police report stated: ‚ÄúThere were seventy-two (72) witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio and/or video recordings. Copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the USAO for review. Copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the Technical Support Unit (TSU) located at the IAD.‚Äù Of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to WND, leaving 38 missing. Statement transcripts None of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses‚Äô own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former NYPD officer Sanders described as ‚Äúcop talk.‚Äù White House guard post video Stills were released but not the video. It would show whether anyone was manning the post when Carey drove up; whether she tried to drive around the off-duty guard who dragged a gate in front of her; and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. Police radio recordings No recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of Carey were provided in the FOIA material. Also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions (instant messaging) between squad cars and police headquarters. Ballistics and forensics reports The Justice Department Washington Metro Police Department responses to FOIA requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. 
I could go on and on. For people who want facts and reports, the U.S. Justice Department under both Holder and Lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. 
We‚Äôve been at this for a long time ‚Äì years. Yet the stonewall and cover-up of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. 
Do we really expect Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that?

His latest book is ""Negrophilia: From Slave Block to Pedestal - America's Racial Obsession."" In 2007, he was the first to give national attention to the story of Sen.

‚Äú I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women‚Äôs rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. ‚Äù 
‚Äì Hillary Clinton 
The first salvo from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (or rather, her answer to the first question posed by Fox News‚Äô Chris Wallace to her and Donald Trump at the third presidential debate) was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. 
Those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing ‚Äúdog whistle politics,‚Äù rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. Ms. Clinton‚Äôs response to Wallace‚Äôs question (where they wanted to see the Supreme Court take the country, and their views on how the Constitution ought to be interpreted) however, was representative of this tactic. 
While women‚Äôs rights and those of the LGBT community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court (since objectively, women wouldn‚Äôt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the LGBT community accounts for less than 5 percent of the American population), Clinton‚Äôs answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. 
‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs rights‚Äù is of course ‚Äúdog whistle‚Äù for unfettered abortion, even late-term abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. ‚ÄúLGBT rights‚Äù is ‚Äúdog whistle‚Äù for disenfranchising the majority of Americans who hold traditional values, primarily Christians. Leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against Christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of Christians in Europe and Canada. A direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the U.S. (at least not at present); however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. 
Let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the Constitution and that Clinton‚Äôs overall objectives are manifestly evil. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs stated priorities for the Supreme Court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the Constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. The hypocrisy attendant to Clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. 
Clinton‚Äôs reference to ‚Äúpowerful corporations and the wealthy‚Äù and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, Citizens United, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. Clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of American socialists. Even if Citizens United were a vehicle for ‚Äúdark, unaccountable money,‚Äù the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the Muslim Brotherhood, with which Bill and Hillary Clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by George Soros, the former Nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in America, someone with whom the Clintons also have a long association. 
One need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind Clinton‚Äôs debate rhetoric to discern what a Hillary Clinton presidency might look like. Her actions to date ‚Äì and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office ‚Äì should suffice quite nicely. Despite the craven complicity of the establishment press (mainstream media), there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the Democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated Barack Obama‚Äôs rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. 
In recent days, we‚Äôve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality that‚Äôs been brought to bear in getting Clinton elected, from Democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of Clinton‚Äôs popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the White House. 
The bottom line here is that Hillary Clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. What all Americans ‚Äì not just voters, and not just Republicans ‚Äì need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the Republican Party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the Democratic Party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. 
The burning question is this: In the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government?

Our country is at a crossroads. Never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. One road, the one favored by politician Hillary Clinton and her Democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. The other, favored by businessman Donald Trump and some of his Republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward free-market capitalism. 
It is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. In this system they control the lion‚Äôs share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. In this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. As the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. Statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hard-earned money he or she spends. Yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. 
We‚Äôve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the free-market system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. No, it isn‚Äôt perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. 
Notice what I didn‚Äôt say is ‚Äúsimply willing to work hard.‚Äù There is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù ‚Äì the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around $85,000 a year in some parts of the country. The Democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. That completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder Americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. 
Ideally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. 
Unfortunately, this so-called living wage will destroy jobs. It will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. 
But this living wage is only part of what the Democrats want to do in the name of fairness. 
This, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. 
Wages have remained flat for far too long, but the Democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. 
Most people simply do not understand that businesses don‚Äôt pay taxes. They are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. And when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as we‚Äôve seen in Obamacare, there is a large outcry. That‚Äôs when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. That‚Äôs when the door to socialism/communism slams shut. 
They tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. Our benevolent government will take care of us. They are offering us free college ‚Äì or almost free loans ‚Äì in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. And if we don‚Äôt get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. Under President Hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. What a country! 
If we don‚Äôt reach our goals, everything will be OK because Social Security and Medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isn‚Äôt enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. 
What about the fact that Social Security and Medicare are going broke? How long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses? They never talk about that. 
As British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, ‚ÄúThe problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people‚Äôs money.‚Äù 
Don‚Äôt be fooled: This election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. It‚Äôs an important fork in the road: One fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. The other offers a free lunch.

Two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered NFL fan. The game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. 
Democrats can be counted upon to call the Republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly Mitt Romney or the Supreme Court justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision. Donald Trump, you see, is ‚Äúracist‚Äù because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him ‚Äúmy African-American.‚Äù Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is not anti-Semitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husband‚Äôs former congressional campaign manager as a ‚Äúf‚Äì-ing Jew bastard.‚Äù 
With a Republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies ‚Äì big or small, real or imagined ‚Äì while giving the Democrat a pass. So Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfailure to ever apologize‚Äù outweighs an examination of Clinton‚Äôs flat-out lie during the third debate when she insisted that the Supreme Court Heller case was about ‚Äútoddlers,‚Äù as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. 
In Heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word ‚Äútoddler‚Äù appear. Clinton, a year ago, flat-out said, ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.‚Äù To normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. 
Meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an ‚Äúemail scandal,‚Äù when the accurate description is ‚Äúnational security scandal.‚Äù The Espionage Act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. The law does not require, as FBI Director James Comey falsely stated, an ‚Äúintent.‚Äù Nor is it relevant, as Clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was ‚Äúhacked.‚Äù 
Five people who worked with or for Clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. Some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. But the ‚Äútarget,‚Äù that is to say Hillary Clinton, was deemed by Comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. So why the immunity deals? Who knows ‚Äì and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares? 
Clinton insists that ‚ÄúPresident Obama doesn‚Äôt get enough credit‚Äù for the swell job he did with the economy. This would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. This would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that Gallup CEO Jim Clifton calls ‚Äúthe big lie,‚Äù given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are under-employed. 
Meanwhile, it‚Äôs yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by Trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist Gloria Allred. Allred, a Clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of Trump‚Äôs sexual misconduct and her support for Clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husband‚Äôs accusers. One such accuser, Juanita Broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by Bill Clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, Hillary Clinton verbally threatened her. 
Hillary Clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about Broaddrick‚Äôs allegation. Never. And only one national reporter, Sam Donaldson, has ever asked Bill Clinton about Juanita Broaddrick‚Äôs allegation. Ever. Clinton‚Äôs answer? He referred Donaldson to his lawyer, David Kendall. Donaldson quickly tried again, asking the then-president to ‚Äúsimply deny it.‚Äù Same answer: ‚ÄúMy attorney ‚Ä¶ speaks for me.‚Äù And that was that. 
So Hillary Clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy that‚Äôs given us the worst recovery since 1949; who has clearly violated the Espionage Act and placed the nation‚Äôs security at risk; who told the Benghazi victim‚Äôs families that the death of four Americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different; whose charitable foundation engaged in pay-to-play in Haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and non-donors went to the back of the line; who wants to gut the Second Amendment; who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of ISIS, Russia and the Chinese; and whose media compadres, including scribes with the New York Times, Washington Post and CNBC, have been outed by WikiLeaks as colluding with her campaign. And she is now odds-on favorite to become the next president of the United States.

NEW YORK ‚ÄìYouTube on Wednesday suspended the account of Danney Williams, the 30-year-old who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former President Bill Clinton. 
YouTube, citing ‚Äúrepeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines,‚Äù declared the account ‚Äúcannot be restored.‚Äù 
The YouTube decision blocked the nine-minute feature ‚ÄúBANISHED ‚Äì The Untold Story of Danney Williams,‚Äù which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity.

‚ÄúMy YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone,‚Äù Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTube‚Äôs decision. ‚Äú[YouTube] can‚Äôt handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon.‚Äù 
Twitter also continues to allow Williams to post the ‚ÄúBanished‚Äù video on Danney Williams‚Äô page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message : ‚ÄúThis video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.‚Äù 
The video is still running on Danney Williams-Clinton‚Äôs Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. 
Attempt to silence Danney Williams? 
Gilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. 
‚ÄúThe behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danney‚Äôs account is outrageous! There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines,‚Äù Gilbert said. 
Gilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. 
‚ÄúThe only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, ‚Äòto run him off the plantation‚Äô as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governor‚Äôs mansion in 1990,‚Äù Gilbert said. 
‚ÄúDanney cannot be silenced any longer,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúHillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but it‚Äôs not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin.‚Äù 
See the Danney Williams video feature: 
WND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. 
Accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. 
No definitive DNA test 
WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams‚Äô claim first surfaced. 
Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a ‚ÄúDNA showdown‚Äù proving Bill Clinton was not Williams‚Äô father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, ‚ÄúThere was no match, nothing even close.‚Äù 
But in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton‚Äôs DNA,‚Äù Bunton told WND. 
Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. 
He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. 
‚ÄúWe got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back,‚Äù Bunton recalled to WND. ‚ÄúWe thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write.‚Äù 
The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. 
‚ÄòTwitter rules‚Äô 
Many other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James O‚ÄôKeefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. Just as O‚ÄôKeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of ‚ÄúTwitter Rules.‚Äù The notice said he ‚Äúmust delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit: harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users‚Äô private information‚Äù or violating ‚Äúother rules.‚Äù In a statement, O‚ÄôKeefe said he relies on social media to ‚Äúbypass the media and directly reach the public.‚Äù On Monday, O‚ÄôKeefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block ‚Äúbizarre.‚Äù Earlier this month, O‚ÄôKeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didn‚Äôt show up on Google‚Äôs ‚Äútrending‚Äù list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his ‚ÄúGays for Trump‚Äù party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Ashamed,‚Äù about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movie‚Äôs entire channel was suspended . 
Among the conservatives censored by Facebook : Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30-day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friend‚Äôs account being censored.

He has been a reporter and editor at several suburban newspapers in the Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, areas and also served as managing editor of Triangle Business Journal in Raleigh, North Carolina. Print Hillary Clinton with top aide Huma Abedin. 
WikiLeaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what Hillary Clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration, but Clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations. 
She has focused instead on criticizing the Russians as the source of the hacks, despite the fact there is no proof of Russian involvement. 
The emails also shed light on how the Clinton campaign interacts with Wall Street banks, with friendly media, and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of Democratic rival Bernie Sanders with the help of the DNC. 
WikiLeaks says it has about 50,000 emails from the private Gmail account of John Podesta, a senior Democratic Party official who has served as White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser to President Obama. He was the author of Obama‚Äôs climate change policy. John Podesta 
In February Podesta moved seamlessly from the White House to become chairman of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign. 
Here are some of the most explosive revelations from the WikiLeaks email dumps featuring Podesta‚Äôs account and others. 
Preference for Muslim Americans In 2008, when Podesta served as co-chair of President-elect Barack Obama‚Äôs transition team, Michael Froman, a former Citibank executive, sent Podesta a ‚Äúlist of African American, Latino and Asian American candidates, broken down by Cabinet/Deputy and Under/Assistant/Deputy Assistant level, plus a list of Native American, Arab/Muslim American and Disabled American candidates.‚Äù The Arab American list came with a special note to exclude Arab Christians ‚Äì they had to be both Arab and Muslim.As New Republic reports, Obama‚Äôs eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as Froman recommended.Froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis. 
Shielding Obama In a March 4, 2015, email to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs lawyer Cheryl Mills, Clinton‚Äôs eventual campaign chairman Podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between Clinton and President Obama that were sent over Clinton‚Äôs private server.The day before Podesta sent his email to Mills, the House Benghazi Committee privately told Clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails.The email from Podesta to Mills says: ‚ÄúThink we should hold emails to and from potus? That‚Äôs the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will.‚Äù An email exchange between Podesta, Paul Begala, and Clinton pollster GQRR shows the Clinton campaign was pushing the Muslim Obama narrative back in January 2008. Included was a survey of Obama ‚Äúnegative facts‚Äù such as this one: ‚ÄúObama (owe-BAHM-uh)‚Äôs father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the world‚Äôs most populous Islamic country.‚Äù The pollster writes ‚Äúwe have reworked the Obama message into the survey, as requested.‚Äù 
Secret speeches to Wall Street Hillary Clinton was so enraged that Bill Clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley in 2015 that she ‚Äúneeded a cool down period.‚Äù The email chain, on March 11, 2015, before she formally launched her campaign, includes top aides to both Hillary Clinton and former President Clinton, and reveals that Hillary‚Äôs future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of Bill giving a speech to a Wall Street bank. ‚ÄúMorgan Stanley is coming down,‚Äù wrote Robby Mook in an email to top Clinton aides.Top aide Huma Abedin explained that Hillary would not be happy about it, writing: ‚ÄúHRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech. I will have to tell her that [Bill] chose to cancel it, not that we asked.‚Äù Hillary Clinton‚Äôs paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms, a point of contention during this year‚Äôs primary, were the subject of an email to Podesta. Excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by Clinton‚Äôs research team, including the necessity of having ‚Äúboth a public and a private position‚Äù on issues. It was just part of ‚Äúmaking sausage‚Äù in the political arena, she said, that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public. Some ‚Äúflags‚Äù in Hillary Clinton‚Äôs paid speeches were noted in a Jan. 25 email from campaign research director Tony Carrk to top Clinton advisers, including Clinton‚Äôs declaration that ‚ÄúMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.‚Äù Countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as ‚Äúfact checkers‚Äù tried to downplay this email by saying it was ‚Äúmostly about trade,‚Äù not immigration, as if the words ‚Äúopen borders‚Äù were never mentioned. But the email exchange also shows how Hillary‚Äôs about-face on the TPP trade deal was mere pandering to Bernie Sanders‚Äô voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals. In a speech at Goldman-Black Rock on Feb. 4, 2014, Carrk pointed out, Clinton admitted she‚Äôs ‚ÄúKind Of Far Removed‚Äù from middle-class struggles due to ‚ÄúThe Economic, You Know, Fortunes That My Husband And I Now Enjoy.‚Äù Clinton, in other speeches, boasted of her ties to Wall Street, an issue primary opponent Bernie Sanders continually raised. Clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns. 
Working in tandem with ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô media WND reported Tuesday emails showing reporters, editors and contributors not just advocating for Hillary Clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign. Univision Chairman Haim Saban urged the Clinton campaign to hit Donald Trump harder over immigration. The Boston Globe tried to time a Clinton opinion piece to do the most good in New Hampshire. CNBC‚Äôs John Harwood urged Clinton campaign chairman Podesta to watch out for then-GOP candidate Dr. Ben Carson. Democratic National Committee official and CNN contributor Donna Brazile apparently tipped off the Clinton campaign to a potentially difficult CNN town-hall question on capital punishment during the Democratic Party primary season. Brazile adamantly denies it . In a July 2015 email, New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich appeared to ask permission from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article. Palmieri replied, suggesting he remove a reference Clinton made to Sarah Palin and delete Clinton‚Äôs statement, ‚ÄúAnd gay rights has moved much faster than women‚Äôs rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon.‚Äù CNBC correspondent John Harwood, who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to Donald Trump as a primary debate moderator, effectively served as an adviser to the Clinton campaign, emailing Podesta with the subject line ‚ÄúWatch out.‚Äù The warning was regarding GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who ‚Äúcould give you real trouble in a general (election).‚Äù Maggie Haberman, a former Politico reporter who now works for the New York Times, was described in a January 2015 memo as having ‚Äúa very good relationship‚Äù with the Clinton campaign. ‚ÄúWe have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed,‚Äù the memo said. 
Demeaning Catholics Podesta discussed fomenting ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù in the Catholic Church with a progressive activist while Hillary‚Äôs now-communications director Jennifer Palmieri mocked Catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the Democratic Party. ‚ÄúThere needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,‚Äù Sandy Newman, president and founder of the nonprofit Voices for Progress, wrote Podesta in February 2012 . The email, among the third batch released by WikiLeaks, was titled ‚Äúopening for a Catholic Spring? just musing.‚Äù Podesta tells Newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right.‚ÄúWe created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this,‚Äù the Clinton campaign chairman writes. ‚ÄúBut I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.‚Äù Clinton, who has accused Trump of praising Putin, called the Russian leader in a 2014 speech ‚Äúengaging‚Äù and ‚Äúa very interesting conversationalist.‚Äù Excerpts from Clinton‚Äôs speeches were contained in a document emailed to Podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign. 
Collusion with DOJ Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon alerted staffers that the Justice Department was proposing to publish Clinton‚Äôs work-related emails, contending it showed collusion between the Obama administration and Clinton‚Äôs campaign. Fallon wrote that ‚ÄúDOJ folks‚Äù told him a court hearing in the case had been planned. The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, Podesta met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. Lawyers also told the Clinton campaign in emails that Hillary‚Äôs private email scandal ‚Äú smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I‚Äôve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc .‚Äù 
Entanglements with foreign governments King Muhammad IV of Morocco made a $12 million pledge to fund the Clinton Global Initiative conference, but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker. Hillary‚Äôs top aide, Huma Abedin, wrote in a January 2015 email that ‚Äúif HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter.‚Äù Then she warned: ‚ÄúShe created this mess and she knows it.‚Äù Hillary ended up not attending but her husband Bill did. An email from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs account to Podesta on Aug. 17, 2014, said Saudi Arabia and Qatar were ‚Äúproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to [ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.‚Äù Critics have pointed out that the Clinton Foundation has received considerable funding from the two Middle East nations. In a leaked 2013 paid speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago, Hillary said Jordan and Turkey ‚Äúcan‚Äôt possibly vet all those refugees so they don‚Äôt know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.‚Äù Two years later she called for a 550 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. largely from United Nations refugee camps in Jordan. 
Insider‚Äôs insider had sway over DNC A WikiLeaks email dump on July 22 revealed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz used her position as head of the DNC to work in concert with the Clinton campaign to undermine the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. Schultz was forced to resign over the emails. Issues used to undermine Sanders‚Äô campaign included his faith, or lack thereof. The Clinton campaign tried to reschedule the Illinois presidential primary to lower the chances a moderate Republican would get a boost following the Super Tuesday primaries. ‚ÄúThe Clintons won‚Äôt forget what their friends have done for them,‚Äù wrote Robby Mook, who later became Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager, in the November 2014 email to Podesta.";english;2016-10-27T03:12:09.534+03:00;wnd.com;GB;1550.0;26 WikiLeaks bombshells on Hillary you need to know;0.0;http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/10/Hillary-Clinton-WH.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias

Here's their answer;"Print Fairfax County, Virginia, voter Jena Jones told WND and Radio America she found this Democrat insert included with her absentee ballot, among others 
Democratic Party officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, are categorically denying that pro-Democrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voter‚Äôs absentee ballot, arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, or FCDC. 
Earlier this week, Jena and David Jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot. (See images of the materials Jena and David say they found at the end of this article. Also included are two images from Democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters.) 
‚ÄúI found a letter from the governor of Virginia asking me to please vote Democrat and ‚Äòhelp keep Virginia blue‚Äô this year,‚Äù Jena explained. ‚ÄúThen I got a letter from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, giving me a step-by-step, yes-and-no what I should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot.‚Äù 
In recent days, at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots. 
After the report was first published, and shared on Facebook by David Jones, Fairfax County Democratic Committee Executive Director Frank Anderson replied to David‚Äôs post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained. 
‚ÄúThese materials were NOT sent in the same envelope as the ballot. The ballot is mailed separately by the Office of Elections. Political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots. The two envelopes arrived at the same time,‚Äù commented Anderson. 
That triggered a quick back-and-forth between David Jones and Anderson. 
‚ÄúI hate to tell you but you‚Äôre wrong. All items came in one envelope,‚Äù Jones said. 
Like the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America‚Äôs independent news network. 
‚ÄúImpossible. That letter came out of my office. We never have access to other people‚Äôs ballots,‚Äù replied Anderson. 
‚ÄúThen it seems those that sent the ballots have access to YOUR letters,‚Äù said Jones. ‚ÄúWho should I believe? You or my lying eyes?‚Äù 
Anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot, and mailings are sent to those voters to promote Democratic Party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives. 
‚ÄúI am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed. We are a political office and have no business handling anyone‚Äôs ballots. You can believe what you want to believe,‚Äù concluded Anderson. 
The Virginia Department of Elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response. But after seeing reports from WND and Radio America, Anderson protested the premise of the story. 
‚ÄúPlease stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim,‚Äù stated Anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the Jones account could not be accurate. 
He shared a photo sent by State Sen. Scott Surovell, showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing Democratic Party advocacy. 
In a formal interview, FCDC Communications Adviser Bruce Neilson told WND and Radio America the Jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù said Neilson, who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local Democrats. 
‚ÄúVoting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe activity of voting is also a public record. The Fairfax County Democratic Committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot. We get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed. 
‚ÄúThe same day the ballot is mailed, our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the Fairfax (County) Democratic Committee knows to be Democratic positions on the ballot,‚Äù said Neilson, noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax. 
Listen to the WND/Radio America interview with Bruce Neilson: 
However, he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself. 
‚ÄúThat material is mailed in a separate envelope, labeled with our initials ‚Äì FCDC ‚Äì and our return address in Fairfax, Virginia, and would be received either the same day, perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government,‚Äù Neilson said. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a separate mailing. It‚Äôs a separate stamp. It‚Äôs a separate envelope. It‚Äôs very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while you‚Äôre filling in your votes,‚Äù he said. 
Jones is standing by her story 100 percent, as is her husband. David says it‚Äôs a very clear memory. 
‚ÄúJena opened the envelope that contained her ballot, the green sample ballot, the two-sided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying ‚Äògo vote‚Äô or something of that nature. There was also the return envelope, which I signed,‚Äù David said. 
The coverage of Jena‚Äôs story has also elicited similar stories from two other Fairfax County voters. Both of them commented on Reddit. 
‚ÄúI can confirm this. I live in Herndon, VA (Fairfax County) and also received these materials in my absentee ballot. I thought it was fishy at the time but didn‚Äôt look into it,‚Äù stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename.

Another, under the Reddit handle Nightingale-Nights, said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones David and Jena shared last week. 
Neilson said there is no way the county government, which sends out the ballots, could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot. 
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have our materials,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur materials are printed for us, by our printer, and we have complete control over our materials in our office, and they come from our office in our mailing. They don‚Äôt go anywhere else. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible that the county government is distributing partisan Democratic materials. It‚Äôs never happened before. I‚Äôm not aware of it happening now. And I don‚Äôt think that it would happen anywhere in the future,‚Äù Neilson said. 
There are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in Fairfax County, leading David Jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible. He accepts the explanation that the Fairfax County Democratic Committee is not responsible for what he and Jena discovered with her ballot. 
‚ÄúI understand Frank‚Äôs comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots. I believe that,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúI think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material. I don‚Äôt see how Frank‚Äôs office could be held accountable for what‚Äôs in the ballot envelope. But it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues.‚Äù 
Neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true. 
‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail,‚Äù Neilson said. 
He also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight. 
‚ÄúI am an election official. On Election Day, I serve in a non-partisan capacity for our county election office,‚Äù Nielson said. ‚ÄúI can assure you, you have Democrats and Republicans working in the office. You have plenty of oversight of the voting process, and there‚Äôs no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot. There is no way that happened.‚Äù

After failed attempts by top Iran officials to cover up the scandal, the nation‚Äôs leading reciter of the Quran and close friend of Ayatollah Khamenei has been accused of raping 19 of his students and charged with ‚Äúadvocating corruption.‚Äù 
Saeed Toosi, 46, winner of the first prize for reading the Quran, both internationally and locally, fell under suspicion after a broadcast by Persian Voice of America ‚Äì banned for viewing by Tehran ‚Äì in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by Toosi, reported Al Arabiya. 
In an audio recording, Toosi said that Khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and, together with the head of Iran‚Äôs judicial authority, had agreed to a cover-up to protect the reputation of the nation‚Äôs quranic institution and the regime. 
It‚Äôs time to stop tiptoeing around the facts. ‚ÄúThe Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades‚Äù is a much-needed dose of truth about the ‚Äúreligion of peace.‚Äù 
One document has Toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a ‚Äúmistake.‚Äù One of the victims ‚Äì a recent first-place winner in a quranic competition ‚Äì claimed he was raped when he was 12 while traveling abroad with Toosi to attend a competition. The mentor, according to the charge, booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place. 
All victims who have filed statements were between 12 and 14 at the time of the alleged attacks. The incidents took place over the past seven years during ‚Äúquranic trips to more than 20 countries in the world aimed at ‚Äòspreading the quranic culture‚Äô and to participate in quranic competitions.‚Äù 
Toosi is highly respected as Iran‚Äôs most celebrated reader of the Quran and was previously called an ‚Äúexemplary model to be followed‚Äù by Khamenei, current supreme leader of Iran. He is a permanent guest of Khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during Ramadan. Last May, Toosi was asked to recite verses from the Quran at the opening session of the Shura council, with many of Iran‚Äôs top officials in attendance. 
The students told Persian VOA they had filed charges with the House of Leadership, but officials dismissed their claims, citing a ‚Äúrepentance letter‚Äù from Toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a ‚Äúchanged man.‚Äù 
While Iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality, sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture, causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced. The case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the Islamic Republic. 
According to the reformist Amad News, officials held a two-hour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast. The initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in Toosi now being charged. 
Judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, whom the victims‚Äô audio showed conspiring with Khamenei to cover up the incidents, defended the regime‚Äôs handling of the case, London Guardian reported. Larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with ‚Äúhostile media‚Äù in the VOA story, ‚Äúso we know who is [loyal] to the revolution and who is not.‚Äù 
The case has been given to a judge for a ruling, though there will be no public trial. Awad News reports members of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution are planning to ‚Äúassassinate‚Äù Toosi to end the scandal and save the regime‚Äôs reputation.

Here's their answer;"Print Fairfax County, Virginia, voter Jena Jones told WND and Radio America she found this Democrat insert included with her absentee ballot, among others 
Democratic Party officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, are categorically denying that pro-Democrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voter‚Äôs absentee ballot, arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, or FCDC. 
Earlier this week, Jena and David Jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot. (See images of the materials Jena and David say they found at the end of this article. Also included are two images from Democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters.) 
‚ÄúI found a letter from the governor of Virginia asking me to please vote Democrat and ‚Äòhelp keep Virginia blue‚Äô this year,‚Äù Jena explained. ‚ÄúThen I got a letter from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, giving me a step-by-step, yes-and-no what I should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot.‚Äù 
In recent days, at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots. 
After the report was first published, and shared on Facebook by David Jones, Fairfax County Democratic Committee Executive Director Frank Anderson replied to David‚Äôs post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained. 
‚ÄúThese materials were NOT sent in the same envelope as the ballot. The ballot is mailed separately by the Office of Elections. Political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots. The two envelopes arrived at the same time,‚Äù commented Anderson. 
That triggered a quick back-and-forth between David Jones and Anderson. 
‚ÄúI hate to tell you but you‚Äôre wrong. All items came in one envelope,‚Äù Jones said. 
Like the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America‚Äôs independent news network. 
‚ÄúImpossible. That letter came out of my office. We never have access to other people‚Äôs ballots,‚Äù replied Anderson. 
‚ÄúThen it seems those that sent the ballots have access to YOUR letters,‚Äù said Jones. ‚ÄúWho should I believe? You or my lying eyes?‚Äù 
Anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot, and mailings are sent to those voters to promote Democratic Party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives. 
‚ÄúI am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed. We are a political office and have no business handling anyone‚Äôs ballots. You can believe what you want to believe,‚Äù concluded Anderson. 
The Virginia Department of Elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response. But after seeing reports from WND and Radio America, Anderson protested the premise of the story. 
‚ÄúPlease stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim,‚Äù stated Anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the Jones account could not be accurate. 
He shared a photo sent by State Sen. Scott Surovell, showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing Democratic Party advocacy. 
In a formal interview, FCDC Communications Adviser Bruce Neilson told WND and Radio America the Jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù said Neilson, who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local Democrats. 
‚ÄúVoting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe activity of voting is also a public record. The Fairfax County Democratic Committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot. We get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed. 
‚ÄúThe same day the ballot is mailed, our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the Fairfax (County) Democratic Committee knows to be Democratic positions on the ballot,‚Äù said Neilson, noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax. 
Listen to the WND/Radio America interview with Bruce Neilson: 
However, he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself. 
‚ÄúThat material is mailed in a separate envelope, labeled with our initials ‚Äì FCDC ‚Äì and our return address in Fairfax, Virginia, and would be received either the same day, perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government,‚Äù Neilson said. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a separate mailing. It‚Äôs a separate stamp. It‚Äôs a separate envelope. It‚Äôs very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while you‚Äôre filling in your votes,‚Äù he said. 
Jones is standing by her story 100 percent, as is her husband. David says it‚Äôs a very clear memory. 
‚ÄúJena opened the envelope that contained her ballot, the green sample ballot, the two-sided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying ‚Äògo vote‚Äô or something of that nature. There was also the return envelope, which I signed,‚Äù David said. 
The coverage of Jena‚Äôs story has also elicited similar stories from two other Fairfax County voters. Both of them commented on Reddit. 
‚ÄúI can confirm this. I live in Herndon, VA (Fairfax County) and also received these materials in my absentee ballot. I thought it was fishy at the time but didn‚Äôt look into it,‚Äù stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename.

Another, under the Reddit handle Nightingale-Nights, said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones David and Jena shared last week. 
Neilson said there is no way the county government, which sends out the ballots, could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot. 
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have our materials,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur materials are printed for us, by our printer, and we have complete control over our materials in our office, and they come from our office in our mailing. They don‚Äôt go anywhere else. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible that the county government is distributing partisan Democratic materials. It‚Äôs never happened before. I‚Äôm not aware of it happening now. And I don‚Äôt think that it would happen anywhere in the future,‚Äù Neilson said. 
There are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in Fairfax County, leading David Jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible. He accepts the explanation that the Fairfax County Democratic Committee is not responsible for what he and Jena discovered with her ballot. 
‚ÄúI understand Frank‚Äôs comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots. I believe that,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúI think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material. I don‚Äôt see how Frank‚Äôs office could be held accountable for what‚Äôs in the ballot envelope. But it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues.‚Äù 
Neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true. 
‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail,‚Äù Neilson said. 
He also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight. 
‚ÄúI am an election official. On Election Day, I serve in a non-partisan capacity for our county election office,‚Äù Nielson said. ‚ÄúI can assure you, you have Democrats and Republicans working in the office. You have plenty of oversight of the voting process, and there‚Äôs no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot. There is no way that happened.‚Äù

After failed attempts by top Iran officials to cover up the scandal, the nation‚Äôs leading reciter of the Quran and close friend of Ayatollah Khamenei has been accused of raping 19 of his students and charged with ‚Äúadvocating corruption.‚Äù 
Saeed Toosi, 46, winner of the first prize for reading the Quran, both internationally and locally, fell under suspicion after a broadcast by Persian Voice of America ‚Äì banned for viewing by Tehran ‚Äì in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by Toosi, reported Al Arabiya. 
In an audio recording, Toosi said that Khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and, together with the head of Iran‚Äôs judicial authority, had agreed to a cover-up to protect the reputation of the nation‚Äôs quranic institution and the regime. 
It‚Äôs time to stop tiptoeing around the facts. ‚ÄúThe Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades‚Äù is a much-needed dose of truth about the ‚Äúreligion of peace.‚Äù 
One document has Toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a ‚Äúmistake.‚Äù One of the victims ‚Äì a recent first-place winner in a quranic competition ‚Äì claimed he was raped when he was 12 while traveling abroad with Toosi to attend a competition. The mentor, according to the charge, booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place. 
All victims who have filed statements were between 12 and 14 at the time of the alleged attacks. The incidents took place over the past seven years during ‚Äúquranic trips to more than 20 countries in the world aimed at ‚Äòspreading the quranic culture‚Äô and to participate in quranic competitions.‚Äù 
Toosi is highly respected as Iran‚Äôs most celebrated reader of the Quran and was previously called an ‚Äúexemplary model to be followed‚Äù by Khamenei, current supreme leader of Iran. He is a permanent guest of Khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during Ramadan. Last May, Toosi was asked to recite verses from the Quran at the opening session of the Shura council, with many of Iran‚Äôs top officials in attendance. 
The students told Persian VOA they had filed charges with the House of Leadership, but officials dismissed their claims, citing a ‚Äúrepentance letter‚Äù from Toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a ‚Äúchanged man.‚Äù

WASHINGTON ‚Äì The campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the White House in January. 
A company that makes Trump and Hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls ‚Äì Trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the Orthodox Jewish clientele. 
So far, the company, Pic-A-Kippa, has sold 331 Trump yarmulkes to 65 for Clinton. 
‚ÄúMy kippa (yarmulke) company sells Trump and Hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more,‚Äù Uri Turk, founder and ‚Äúchief kippa officer,‚Äù told WND. ‚ÄúWe see it as an early exit poll of the Orthodox Jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. Once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the Trump kippas.‚Äù 
Pic-A-Kippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret IDF soldiers from Miami. Turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling Trump and Hillary custom kippas on its site since August, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. 
‚ÄúOur mission is to help Jews everywhere show and wear their Jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas,‚Äù the company says on its website. 
It donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the Lone Soldier Center in Israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. 
Turk said while American Jews have leaned heavily Democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen Orthodox Jews, who make up over 10 percent of American Jewry, vote Republican in ever increasing numbers. He attributes that fact to the Democrats putting ‚Äúdaylight between America and Israel.‚Äù 
A number of influential Jewish pro-Trump organizations have emerged, chief among them ‚ÄúJews Choose Trump‚Äù and ‚ÄúJewish Democrats For Trump.‚Äù A recent poll of Florida Jews showed Orthodox voters are leaning toward Trump by a 3-1 margin. 
According to Turk, Pic-A-Kippa has sold many Trump kippas to a congregant of Ivanka Trump‚Äôs synagogue on the liberal Upper East Side of Manhattan and has gotten orders for Trump kippas from Israel, Australia, Britain and even Mexico. Pic-A-Kippa has also gotten hate mail from Jews unhappy they are selling the Trump designs, he says.";english;2016-10-27T04:22:40.638+03:00;wnd.com;GB;1550.0;Bellwether?

Just in time for the start of the 2016 Major League Baseball World Series, WND Films has acquired the father-son baseball movie, ‚ÄúEvery Boy Needs a Hero,‚Äù for immediate release on DVD. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident that ‚ÄúHero‚Äù is a grand-slam movie that will build up families across America and restore luster to the game,‚Äù said Joseph Farah, WND founder and CEO. 
Starring Burgess Jenkins, of ‚ÄúRemember the Titans‚Äù and ‚ÄúNashville,‚Äù and Gregory Alan Williams, of ‚ÄúMiracles from Heaven,‚Äù this award-winning movie brings the love of baseball to hearth and home. It also features a powerful music soundtrack by three-time Grammy winner Michael Omartian. 
Get ‚ÄúEvery Boy Needs a Hero‚Äù now at the WND Superstore! From the producers of ‚ÄúAlone Yet Not Alone,‚Äù the movie is a powerful tale of restoring and strengthening relationships between fathers and their children. 
According to Dr. Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide, ‚Äú ‚ÄòHero‚Äô is an excellent movie about God turning a man‚Äôs heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father.‚Äù 
Dr. Baehr added, ‚ÄúThe opening is powerful. The ending is heartrending. The drama, the acting, the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie. This is one of the few movies that Movieguide can actually say go see it.‚Äù Keith Harris and Nick Edwards as Wynn and Sammy Heller 
‚ÄúHero‚Äù opens with Joe (played by Burgess Jenkins) coaching his son David‚Äôs baseball team, the Gappers, to the state championship. Seven years later, after pursuing his dream job, Joe returns to town. He had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family. His wife, Hannah, is stricken with cancer, while David is angry that Joe left them. After Hannah‚Äôs funeral, Joe moves back into the house, but David remains bitter. Meanwhile, David is coaching the now hapless Gappers; the team loses more than it wins. Joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners, hoping this gesture will help Joe reconcile with David. Unfortunately, the league rules have softened dramatically, making it nearly impossible to train the team properly: practice times are limited, coaches can‚Äôt make players take laps around the field, everyone gets a ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù trophy. The beloved American pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games, let alone practices. So, Joe starts his own league to turns things around. 
From the director of ‚ÄúIsaiah 9:10 Judgment‚Äù and the producer of ‚ÄúAlone Not Yet Alone‚Äù comes ‚ÄúHero,‚Äù a beautiful tale of the significance of the father-child relationship that‚Äôs and set around America‚Äôs pastime, baseball. 
One of the fathers Joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison, Mr. Redding (played by Gregory Alan Williams). Redding‚Äôs career mirrors that of Joe. He‚Äôs been offered a big job in Washington, D.C. Like Joe, he‚Äôs lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family. In contrast, another Gapper teammate has a father who‚Äôs actually a prison inmate under Redding. Unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls, the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son, but he cannot due to prison rules. Justin Miles and Burgess Jenkins as David and Joe Finn in the film, ‚ÄúEvery Boy Needs a Hero‚Äù 
What makes ‚ÄúHero‚Äù particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself. 
Watch the trailer: 
Washington Times reporter Bradford Richardson wrote in his article, ‚ÄúStudy blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players,‚Äù that the Austin Institute, a Texas-based think tank focused on family and societal issues, has commissioned a study titled, ‚ÄúCalled Out at Home,‚Äù which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball.

Richardson writes: 
Kevin Stuart, executive director of the Austin Institute, said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because ‚Äúit takes two to play catch.‚Äù 
There is a ‚Äúlong-standing connection between fatherhood and baseball,‚Äù Mr. Stuart said, pointing to famous father-son tandems who have played in the Major Leagues and the prominence of father-son relationships in popular baseball movies such as ‚ÄúField of Dreams.‚Äù 
Baseball, he said, was made to be played by fathers and sons. 
‚ÄúBaseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle, where what‚Äôs really necessary, or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills, is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you,‚Äù Mr. Stuart said. 
Anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the study‚Äôs connection between fatherhood and baseball. 
Famous father-son tandems ‚Äì including Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr., Prince Fielder and Cecil Fielder, and Tony Gwynn Sr. and Tony Gwynn Jr. ‚Äì have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next. 
‚ÄúHero‚Äù received a powerful endorsement from renowned Christian author Stormie Omartian: 
‚ÄúFor such a time as this, ‚ÄòHero‚Äô is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son, who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball,‚Äù Farah said. 
Baehr concluded, ‚Äú‚ÄòHero‚Äô is a wonderful, faith-filled sports drama.

A member of the increasingly divided and disputatious Alabama Supreme Court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on ‚Äútheir empathetic feelings‚Äù instead of the law. 
‚ÄúAlabama‚Äôs judges are elected and accountable,‚Äù wrote Justice Tom Parker this week. ‚ÄúFederal judges, as recently noted by Chief Justice Roberts in his dissent in Obergefell v. Hodges ‚Ä¶ a case in which ‚Äòfive lawyers‚Äô on the United States Supreme Court announced a fundamental right to same-sex marriage, are ‚Äòunaccountable and unelected.‚Äô 
He pointed out that three of the four dissenting U.S. Supreme Court justices in Obergefell ‚Äúnoted on eight different occasions that the ‚Äòfive lawyers‚Äô who decided Obergefell were unelected. Chief Justice Roberts said on two occasions that those unelected ‚Äòfive lawyers‚Äô were, consequently, unaccountable.‚Äù 
Parker previously commented that the ‚Äúfive lawyers‚Äù failed to ‚Äúbase their decision ‚Äòon legal reasoning, history, tradition, the court‚Äôs own rules, or the rule of law, but upon the[ir] empathetic feelings.'‚Äù 
‚ÄúObergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges,‚Äù he said. 
He was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriage-based case that the court was reviewing when the Obergefell case, which created same-sex ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù nationwide, was announced. 
Moore, who is challenging the punishment, insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves. They did, with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear Moore‚Äôs arguments. 
Parker said active judges should have been included in the panel, because retired judges, too, are ‚Äúunelected and unaccountable.‚Äù 
‚ÄúUnelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda, instead of faithfully applying the rule of law,‚Äù Parker warned. ‚ÄúObergefell is not the first case concerning same-sex marriage to prove this principle true. Before the United States Supreme Court decided Obergefell, the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the United States. 
Don‚Äôt miss Phyllis Schlafly‚Äôs book, now available autographed at the WND Superstore: ‚ÄúWho Killed The American Family?‚Äù 
‚ÄúBefore Obergefell, 40 states passed laws affirming traditional marriage. In 37 of those states, the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional. Of the 37 state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts, 24 of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional. Each of the 24 courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable.‚Äù 
He explained what happens when activist judges are held to account, citing the situation that developed in Iowa. 
‚ÄúThe Supreme Court of Iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down Iowa‚Äôs traditional marriage law as unconstitutional. The judges of the Supreme Court of Iowa are appointed by the governor of Iowa. However, although the judges are initially appointed, they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires.‚Äù 
He explained that after the Iowa Legislature adopted one-man-one-woman marriage as law, in April 2009, in ‚Äúa decision largely viewed as judicial activism, the Supreme Court of Iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of Iowa and held [the law] unconstitutional.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe very next year, three of the judges ‚Ä¶ who had concurred in Varnum had to stand for a retention election; all three were removed from office by vote of the people of Iowa. This was the first time since Iowa adopted its retention-election system that any judge had ever failed to be retained. The people of Iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law.‚Äù 
Mathew Staver, chairman of of Liberty Counsel, which is representing Moore, said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial system‚Äôs handling of Moore‚Äôs case. 
‚ÄúChief Justice Moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive ‚Äì equal justice under the law. He wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThe people of Alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable. At every turn, this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of Alabama. Never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired. We hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution. The Court of the Judiciary violated the law when it suspended Chief Justice Moore for life even though it lacked the 9-0 vote. Never before under the unanimity requirement of COJ Rule 16 has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term. A sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a four-page order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life. This is not right.‚Äù 
Supporters of Moore also have filed an ethics complaint against Lyn Stuart, who has been acting as Alabama‚Äôs chief justice. 
She is accused of ‚Äúviolating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding Chief Justice Roy Moore.‚Äù 
The complaint comes from the Sanctity of Marriage Alabama organization. 
‚ÄúIf the Judicial Inquiry commission really cares about ethics, fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the Alabama judiciary, they will no doubt take our complaint seriously, as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on Chief Justice Moore,‚Äù said Tom Ford, a spokesman for the group. 
The complaints, the group said, outline ‚Äúhow acting Chief Justice Lyn Stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety, failed to perform the duties of her office impartially, failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.‚Äù 
Parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary. 
Daniel Horowitz , senior editor at Conservative Review, told WND that the nation is going through a ‚Äúsocial transformation without representation.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues, whether it‚Äôs the bureaucrats, whether it‚Äôs the courts, and as it relates to even religious liberty, even property rights, immigration, our voting rights, who gets to vote,‚Äù he said. 
Horowitz tackles the topic of ‚Äúsocial transformation without representation‚Äù in his book ‚ÄúStolen Sovereignty: How to Stop Unelected Judges From Transforming America.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHow did we get here?‚Äù Horowitz asked rhetorically. ‚ÄúAnd the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this. This was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges, the legal profession, and unelected bureaucrats. That is social transformation without representation, which, as Scalia warned, is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first American Revolution.‚Äù 
Same-sex marriage was mandated for the nation in 2015 by the bare 5-4 majority made up of Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and the late Antonin Scalia opposed it. 
The majority found in the Constitution a right to same-sex marriage, overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states. 
It elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the U.S. Supreme Court majority. 
For one, two of the justices in the majority, Kagan and Ginsburg, were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for same-sex marriage, apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality. Without their votes, the case would have gone the other way. 
They refused. 
Then there was the U.S. Supreme Court‚Äôs own opinion just two years earlier, in the Defense of Marriage Act case, in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage. 
And there also are those who point out that the Constitution doesn‚Äôt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people. 
As WND reported , Ginsburg, who voted in favor of same-sex marriage, has performed same-sex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements. Justice Elena Kagan also has performed same-sex weddings and promoted ‚Äúgay‚Äù rights at Harvard‚Äôs law school while she was at its helm. 
Critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
The Foundation for Moral Law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case, but they refused to acknowledge the request. The Foundation explained that Canon 3A(6) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges provides: ‚ÄúA judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.‚Äù 28 U.S.C. sec 455(a) mandates that a justice ‚Äúshall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.‚Äù 
Rabbi Jonathan Cahn, author of the New York Times bestseller ‚ÄúThe Harbinger‚Äù and the inspiration behind the ‚ÄúIsaiah 9:10 Judgment‚Äù movie, has criticized the Supreme Court‚Äôs assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage. 
At a prayer event in Washington, he said: ‚ÄúThe justices of the Supreme Court took up their seats [in a hearing] on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage. That the event should even take place is a sign this is America of [George] Washington‚Äôs warning ‚Ä¶ a nation at war against its own foundation.‚Äù 
Washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation ‚Äúthat disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained.‚Äù 
‚ÄúJustices, can you judge the ways of God? There is another court and there is another judge, where all men and all judges will give account,‚Äù he warned. 
‚ÄúIf a nation‚Äôs high court should pass judgment on the Almighty, should you then be surprised God will pass judgment on the court and that nation? We are doing that which Israel did on the altars of Baal,‚Äù he said.

Just in time for the start of the 2016 Major League Baseball World Series, WND Films has acquired the father-son baseball movie, ‚ÄúEvery Boy Needs a Hero,‚Äù for immediate release on DVD. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident that ‚ÄúHero‚Äù is a grand-slam movie that will build up families across America and restore luster to the game,‚Äù said Joseph Farah, WND founder and CEO. 
Starring Burgess Jenkins, of ‚ÄúRemember the Titans‚Äù and ‚ÄúNashville,‚Äù and Gregory Alan Williams, of ‚ÄúMiracles from Heaven,‚Äù this award-winning movie brings the love of baseball to hearth and home. It also features a powerful music soundtrack by three-time Grammy winner Michael Omartian. 
Get ‚ÄúEvery Boy Needs a Hero‚Äù now at the WND Superstore! From the producers of ‚ÄúAlone Yet Not Alone,‚Äù the movie is a powerful tale of restoring and strengthening relationships between fathers and their children. 
According to Dr. Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide, ‚Äú ‚ÄòHero‚Äô is an excellent movie about God turning a man‚Äôs heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father.‚Äù 
Dr. Baehr added, ‚ÄúThe opening is powerful. The ending is heartrending. The drama, the acting, the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie. This is one of the few movies that Movieguide can actually say go see it.‚Äù Keith Harris and Nick Edwards as Wynn and Sammy Heller 
‚ÄúHero‚Äù opens with Joe (played by Burgess Jenkins) coaching his son David‚Äôs baseball team, the Gappers, to the state championship. Seven years later, after pursuing his dream job, Joe returns to town. He had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family. His wife, Hannah, is stricken with cancer, while David is angry that Joe left them. After Hannah‚Äôs funeral, Joe moves back into the house, but David remains bitter. Meanwhile, David is coaching the now hapless Gappers; the team loses more than it wins. Joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners, hoping this gesture will help Joe reconcile with David. Unfortunately, the league rules have softened dramatically, making it nearly impossible to train the team properly: practice times are limited, coaches can‚Äôt make players take laps around the field, everyone gets a ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù trophy. The beloved American pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games, let alone practices. So, Joe starts his own league to turns things around. 
From the director of ‚ÄúIsaiah 9:10 Judgment‚Äù and the producer of ‚ÄúAlone Not Yet Alone‚Äù comes ‚ÄúHero,‚Äù a beautiful tale of the significance of the father-child relationship that‚Äôs and set around America‚Äôs pastime, baseball. 
One of the fathers Joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison, Mr. Redding (played by Gregory Alan Williams). Redding‚Äôs career mirrors that of Joe. He‚Äôs been offered a big job in Washington, D.C. Like Joe, he‚Äôs lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family. In contrast, another Gapper teammate has a father who‚Äôs actually a prison inmate under Redding. Unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls, the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son, but he cannot due to prison rules.

What makes ‚ÄúHero‚Äù particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself. 
Watch the trailer: 
Washington Times reporter Bradford Richardson wrote in his article, ‚ÄúStudy blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players,‚Äù that the Austin Institute, a Texas-based think tank focused on family and societal issues, has commissioned a study titled, ‚ÄúCalled Out at Home,‚Äù which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball.

Richardson writes: 
Kevin Stuart, executive director of the Austin Institute, said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because ‚Äúit takes two to play catch.‚Äù 
There is a ‚Äúlong-standing connection between fatherhood and baseball,‚Äù Mr. Stuart said, pointing to famous father-son tandems who have played in the Major Leagues and the prominence of father-son relationships in popular baseball movies such as ‚ÄúField of Dreams.‚Äù 
Baseball, he said, was made to be played by fathers and sons. 
‚ÄúBaseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle, where what‚Äôs really necessary, or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills, is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you,‚Äù Mr. Stuart said. 
Anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the study‚Äôs connection between fatherhood and baseball. 
Famous father-son tandems ‚Äì including Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr., Prince Fielder and Cecil Fielder, and Tony Gwynn Sr. and Tony Gwynn Jr. ‚Äì have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next. 
‚ÄúHero‚Äù received a powerful endorsement from renowned Christian author Stormie Omartian: 
‚ÄúFor such a time as this, ‚ÄòHero‚Äô is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son, who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball,‚Äù Farah said. 
Baehr concluded, ‚Äú‚ÄòHero‚Äô is a wonderful, faith-filled sports drama. It will touch your heart, your mind and your soul.‚Äù Gapper team dads from the film, ‚ÄúEvery Boy Needs a Hero‚Äù";english;2016-10-27T04:38:32.298+03:00;wnd.com;GB;1550.0;'Grand slam!'

A member of the increasingly divided and disputatious Alabama Supreme Court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on ‚Äútheir empathetic feelings‚Äù instead of the law. 
‚ÄúAlabama‚Äôs judges are elected and accountable,‚Äù wrote Justice Tom Parker this week. ‚ÄúFederal judges, as recently noted by Chief Justice Roberts in his dissent in Obergefell v. Hodges ‚Ä¶ a case in which ‚Äòfive lawyers‚Äô on the United States Supreme Court announced a fundamental right to same-sex marriage, are ‚Äòunaccountable and unelected.‚Äô 
He pointed out that three of the four dissenting U.S. Supreme Court justices in Obergefell ‚Äúnoted on eight different occasions that the ‚Äòfive lawyers‚Äô who decided Obergefell were unelected. Chief Justice Roberts said on two occasions that those unelected ‚Äòfive lawyers‚Äô were, consequently, unaccountable.‚Äù 
Parker previously commented that the ‚Äúfive lawyers‚Äù failed to ‚Äúbase their decision ‚Äòon legal reasoning, history, tradition, the court‚Äôs own rules, or the rule of law, but upon the[ir] empathetic feelings.'‚Äù 
‚ÄúObergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges,‚Äù he said. 
He was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriage-based case that the court was reviewing when the Obergefell case, which created same-sex ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù nationwide, was announced. 
Moore, who is challenging the punishment, insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves. They did, with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear Moore‚Äôs arguments. 
Parker said active judges should have been included in the panel, because retired judges, too, are ‚Äúunelected and unaccountable.‚Äù 
‚ÄúUnelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda, instead of faithfully applying the rule of law,‚Äù Parker warned. ‚ÄúObergefell is not the first case concerning same-sex marriage to prove this principle true. Before the United States Supreme Court decided Obergefell, the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the United States. 
Don‚Äôt miss Phyllis Schlafly‚Äôs book, now available autographed at the WND Superstore: ‚ÄúWho Killed The American Family?‚Äù 
‚ÄúBefore Obergefell, 40 states passed laws affirming traditional marriage. In 37 of those states, the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional. Of the 37 state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts, 24 of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional. Each of the 24 courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable.‚Äù 
He explained what happens when activist judges are held to account, citing the situation that developed in Iowa. 
‚ÄúThe Supreme Court of Iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down Iowa‚Äôs traditional marriage law as unconstitutional. The judges of the Supreme Court of Iowa are appointed by the governor of Iowa. However, although the judges are initially appointed, they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires.‚Äù 
He explained that after the Iowa Legislature adopted one-man-one-woman marriage as law, in April 2009, in ‚Äúa decision largely viewed as judicial activism, the Supreme Court of Iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of Iowa and held [the law] unconstitutional.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe very next year, three of the judges ‚Ä¶ who had concurred in Varnum had to stand for a retention election; all three were removed from office by vote of the people of Iowa. This was the first time since Iowa adopted its retention-election system that any judge had ever failed to be retained. The people of Iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law.‚Äù 
Mathew Staver, chairman of of Liberty Counsel, which is representing Moore, said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial system‚Äôs handling of Moore‚Äôs case. 
‚ÄúChief Justice Moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive ‚Äì equal justice under the law. He wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThe people of Alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable. At every turn, this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of Alabama. Never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired. We hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution. The Court of the Judiciary violated the law when it suspended Chief Justice Moore for life even though it lacked the 9-0 vote. Never before under the unanimity requirement of COJ Rule 16 has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term. A sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a four-page order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life. This is not right.‚Äù 
Supporters of Moore also have filed an ethics complaint against Lyn Stuart, who has been acting as Alabama‚Äôs chief justice. 
She is accused of ‚Äúviolating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding Chief Justice Roy Moore.‚Äù 
The complaint comes from the Sanctity of Marriage Alabama organization. 
‚ÄúIf the Judicial Inquiry commission really cares about ethics, fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the Alabama judiciary, they will no doubt take our complaint seriously, as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on Chief Justice Moore,‚Äù said Tom Ford, a spokesman for the group. 
The complaints, the group said, outline ‚Äúhow acting Chief Justice Lyn Stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety, failed to perform the duties of her office impartially, failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.‚Äù 
Parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary. 
Daniel Horowitz , senior editor at Conservative Review, told WND that the nation is going through a ‚Äúsocial transformation without representation.‚Äù 
‚ÄúIt is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues, whether it‚Äôs the bureaucrats, whether it‚Äôs the courts, and as it relates to even religious liberty, even property rights, immigration, our voting rights, who gets to vote,‚Äù he said. 
Horowitz tackles the topic of ‚Äúsocial transformation without representation‚Äù in his book ‚ÄúStolen Sovereignty: How to Stop Unelected Judges From Transforming America.‚Äù 
‚ÄúHow did we get here?‚Äù Horowitz asked rhetorically. ‚ÄúAnd the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this.

WASHINGTON ‚Äì The campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the White House in January. 
A company that makes Trump and Hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls ‚Äì Trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the Orthodox Jewish clientele. 
So far, the company, Pic-A-Kippa, has sold 331 Trump yarmulkes to 65 for Clinton. 
‚ÄúMy kippa (yarmulke) company sells Trump and Hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more,‚Äù Uri Turk, founder and ‚Äúchief kippa officer,‚Äù told WND. ‚ÄúWe see it as an early exit poll of the Orthodox Jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. Once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the Trump kippas.‚Äù 
Pic-A-Kippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret IDF soldiers from Miami. Turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling Trump and Hillary custom kippas on its site since August, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. 
‚ÄúOur mission is to help Jews everywhere show and wear their Jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas,‚Äù the company says on its website. 
It donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the Lone Soldier Center in Israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. 
Turk said while American Jews have leaned heavily Democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen Orthodox Jews, who make up over 10 percent of American Jewry, vote Republican in ever increasing numbers. He attributes that fact to the Democrats putting ‚Äúdaylight between America and Israel.‚Äù 
A number of influential Jewish pro-Trump organizations have emerged, chief among them ‚ÄúJews Choose Trump‚Äù and ‚ÄúJewish Democrats For Trump.‚Äù A recent poll of Florida Jews showed Orthodox voters are leaning toward Trump by a 3-1 margin. 
According to Turk, Pic-A-Kippa has sold many Trump kippas to a congregant of Ivanka Trump‚Äôs synagogue on the liberal Upper East Side of Manhattan and has gotten orders for Trump kippas from Israel, Australia, Britain and even Mexico. Pic-A-Kippa has also gotten hate mail from Jews unhappy they are selling the Trump designs, he says.";english;2016-10-27T04:38:38.554+03:00;wnd.com;GB;1550.0;Bellwether?

When Judith Gait met ‚ÄúFather X,‚Äù it was a lopsided grief that drew them together. He had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago. Gait is a married mother of five, and long-term American resident in Britain. Her support of the pro-life movement is driven by ‚Äúthankfulness and praise‚Äù for life and her Christian faith. 
Witnessing abortion‚Äôs heavy toll on the living and dead, Gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing. Subtle and working entirely with symbolism, these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion. Rather, they mourn in color, symbol and tone with single shoes, broken cord, dead flowers and other lonely and broken things. ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äùpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
When a friend first visited Gait‚Äôs studio, he was struck by her abortion paintings. Confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child, he wrote: ‚ÄúI realize your work comes from a place of great love, for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture.‚Äù 
Gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child. It happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby, five years to the day. Father X remembers every detail. 
Their conversation grew into a joint effort, culminating in a book, ‚Äú Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas: Meditations on Post Abortion Trauma .‚Äù Father X wanted to remain anonymous, as a place-setter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion. He wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of Gait‚Äôs 30 paintings in this book, which have also been shown together in art exhibits. 
Time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion, Gait claims. Rather, ‚Äúthe past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence, guilt and remorse has not abated.‚Äù You can see that in the words of Father X, which run the gamut of human emotions. ‚ÄúOn Abortion: Shoe, Pot and Crosses‚Äùfrom ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äù 
‚ÄúJonah of Nineveh‚Äù features an upended, single rose with red cords and funereal foliage. Flowers are ‚Äúalready in the birth position, head down and waiting to be born.‚Äù Torn and shroud-like ribbons hang across the painting. Spirals represent a child‚Äôs DNA helix and the ‚Äúveil of the Temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation.‚Äù Father X makes an analogy between Jonah fleeing ‚Äúparental responsibility‚Äù and eventual redemption ‚Äì then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness: ‚ÄúIt was her wedding dress, my sea green empress, this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives. She was full of fear. ‚Ä¶‚Äù 
In some of these works, hammers incongruently hang with flowers. They are bloody or blackened, some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose. Father X interprets these tools as decision markers, to either build or tear down. In ‚ÄúHammer of Decision,‚Äù it belongs to Thor, the war god ‚Äúinfested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction.‚Äù Wagner, the Olympics, ‚Äúsperm races,‚Äù Thomas Moore and Valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author. Either the Carpenter‚Äôs ‚Äúhammer of wisdom‚Äù or Thor‚Äôs ‚Äútool of chaos‚Äù will be chosen by expectant parents. ‚ÄúHammer, Suspended‚Äù 
‚Äú Troubadours ‚Äù runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology. Striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion, the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities. This includes moonlighting for angels, celestial games, ‚Äúinterstellar wind-jammers‚Äù and a ‚Äúbaby steamer sailing on children‚Äôs seas,‚Äù among other delightful prospects. Lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their Limbos. 
Father X occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the Bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions. Running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters, these are not theological statements, but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion. 
In Gait‚Äôs ‚ÄúPink Rose‚Äù and ‚ÄúStardust,‚Äù we see empty fields, withered plants and other tokens. Father X takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children. He places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles, which is reflected in the painting. Children are disfigured, or missing eyes or arms and singing in ‚Äúlow mournful tones‚Äù so as not to disturb their parents. Music is ‚Äúintense, equivalent to the sound created by Hildegard von Bingen (a 12th-century nun and composer). ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äùpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
References to Mary as a mother are common, as well as other scriptural allusions. ‚ÄúAll babies jump for Jesus‚Äù in the womb (or in ‚Äúits sack of nibbling yoke‚Äù) writes Father X. Elizabeth‚Äôs child John ‚Äúleapt for joy, just as his ancestor David did before the ark of the covenant,‚Äù he continues. 
Gait addresses the human embryo, finding Biblical, ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages. Her ‚ÄúAbbey Target Beginning‚Äù has a crosshair target, which is interpreted spiritually: ‚ÄúThe first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread ‚Äì the bread on fire with the Holy Spirit the same stage of development as the child in Mary‚Äôs womb when she arrived at her cousin Elizabeth‚Äôs house.‚Äù 
Post-abort guilt isn‚Äôt rationalized or downplayed, but emotionally reacted to in art and word. Father X describes bats as whirling about ‚Äúin circles at the pitiful sound the [aborted] children make‚Äù because they are tuned to such distressing signals. This contrasts with many parents who are ‚Äústill stone deaf‚Äù to such mournful sounds. At another point, Father-X imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus, a roar of unwanted thoughts. ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äùpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
Father X elaborates on what Gait hints in her paintings: the injustice and evil of abortion. He cites a world built on slavery before Christ‚Äôs advent, and the works of such men as William Wilberforce and John Brown in furthering Christ‚Äôs gospel of justice and peace. All this is contrasted to abortion throughout. 
Ruminating on Gait‚Äôs ‚ÄúPalms of our Lord,‚Äù Father X claims ‚Äúthe face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion. ‚ÄúPalms‚Äù is murky, with a single, red hand print. ‚ÄúTo look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the Tarot of Ruins,‚Äù he continues. 
‚ÄúSuicide‚Äù advances this dark theme, where Gait and Father X criticize the death industry and it‚Äôs euphemistically named ‚Äúclinics.‚Äù He takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ a caricature of a woman who made a mistake, who got herself in trouble, who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart.‚Äù 
But all isn‚Äôt baleful and sad here. In ‚ÄúCloud Children,‚Äù Father X muses on paper dolls in Gait‚Äôs paintings with this lovely thought: ‚ÄúWhere children go ‚Ä¶ is a mystery. ‚Ä¶ Some say they take their daytime rest in Christ‚Äôs tomb in Jerusalem, and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled Star Ships.‚Äù 
‚Äú Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas ‚Äù is a work of meditation, grief counseling, poetry, social commentary and visual art. Father X may not reveal his identity here, but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child. Gait and Father X describe their efforts as a ‚Äúsilent prayer of witness for all the ghost families, those Phantoms of Sorrows, who will never laugh or cry together as a family, because of an abortion.‚Äù They hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way.

When Judith Gait met ‚ÄúFather X,‚Äù it was a lopsided grief that drew them together. He had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago. Gait is a married mother of five, and long-term American resident in Britain. Her support of the pro-life movement is driven by ‚Äúthankfulness and praise‚Äù for life and her Christian faith. 
Witnessing abortion‚Äôs heavy toll on the living and dead, Gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing. Subtle and working entirely with symbolism, these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion. Rather, they mourn in color, symbol and tone with single shoes, broken cord, dead flowers and other lonely and broken things. ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äùpainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X 
When a friend first visited Gait‚Äôs studio, he was struck by her abortion paintings. Confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child, he wrote: ‚ÄúI realize your work comes from a place of great love, for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture.‚Äù 
Gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child. It happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby, five years to the day. Father X remembers every detail. 
Their conversation grew into a joint effort, culminating in a book, ‚Äú Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas: Meditations on Post Abortion Trauma .‚Äù Father X wanted to remain anonymous, as a place-setter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion. He wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of Gait‚Äôs 30 paintings in this book, which have also been shown together in art exhibits. 
Time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion, Gait claims. Rather, ‚Äúthe past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence, guilt and remorse has not abated.‚Äù You can see that in the words of Father X, which run the gamut of human emotions. ‚ÄúOn Abortion: Shoe, Pot and Crosses‚Äùfrom ‚ÄúTroubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas‚Äù 
‚ÄúJonah of Nineveh‚Äù features an upended, single rose with red cords and funereal foliage. Flowers are ‚Äúalready in the birth position, head down and waiting to be born.‚Äù Torn and shroud-like ribbons hang across the painting. Spirals represent a child‚Äôs DNA helix and the ‚Äúveil of the Temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation.‚Äù Father X makes an analogy between Jonah fleeing ‚Äúparental responsibility‚Äù and eventual redemption ‚Äì then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness: ‚ÄúIt was her wedding dress, my sea green empress, this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives. She was full of fear. ‚Ä¶‚Äù 
In some of these works, hammers incongruently hang with flowers. They are bloody or blackened, some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose. Father X interprets these tools as decision markers, to either build or tear down. In ‚ÄúHammer of Decision,‚Äù it belongs to Thor, the war god ‚Äúinfested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction.‚Äù Wagner, the Olympics, ‚Äúsperm races,‚Äù Thomas Moore and Valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author. Either the Carpenter‚Äôs ‚Äúhammer of wisdom‚Äù or Thor‚Äôs ‚Äútool of chaos‚Äù will be chosen by expectant parents. ‚ÄúHammer, Suspended‚Äù 
‚Äú Troubadours ‚Äù runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology. Striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion, the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities. This includes moonlighting for angels, celestial games, ‚Äúinterstellar wind-jammers‚Äù and a ‚Äúbaby steamer sailing on children‚Äôs seas,‚Äù among other delightful prospects. Lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their Limbos. 
Father X occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the Bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions. Running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters, these are not theological statements, but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion. 
In Gait‚Äôs ‚ÄúPink Rose‚Äù and ‚ÄúStardust,‚Äù we see empty fields, withered plants and other tokens. Father X takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children.

But even then that might not be enough: For the young and healthy who are badly needed to make the exchanges work, it is sometimes cheaper to pay the Internal Revenue Service than an insurance company charging large premiums, with huge deductibles.";english;2016-10-27T07:20:12.436+03:00;wnd.com;GB;1550.0;Obamacare tax penalty?

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee is suing the Republican National Committee for aiding GOP nominee Donald Trump as he argues that the presidential election is ‚Äúrigged,‚Äù claiming that Trump‚Äôs argument is designed to suppress the vote in minority communities. 
The suit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in New Jersey, argues that the RNC has not sufficiently rebuked Trump for the line of attack, which he has used as a rallying cry and is assumed to be a way to explain away a potential loss on Election Day.

(Fox News) President Obama‚Äôs high-security BlackBerry used a special process known as ‚Äúwhitelisting‚Äù that only allowed it to take calls and messages from pre-approved contacts, two former senior intelligence officials with knowledge of the set-up told Fox News ‚Äì pointing to the detail as further proof the White House knew Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private account was used for government business. 
As the administration now acknowledges, Obama and Clinton emailed each other while she was helming the State Department. If received on his BlackBerry, the ‚Äúwhitelisting‚Äù safeguard means Clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission ‚Äì covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls. The Obama BlackBerry would have also been configured to accept the communications. 
‚ÄúThink of whitelisting like a bouncer in the VIP line at the party.

(The Federalist) Support for a so-called assault weapons ban in the U.S. just hit a record low of 36 percent, according to a new Gallup poll released on Wednesday. The poll showed that 61 percent of American adults now oppose a ban. That level of opposition is the highest ever recorded. 
Increasing opposition to the 1990‚Äôs-era gun ban isn‚Äôt just limited to Republicans. Gallup‚Äôs data show that opposition to the ban has increased across the board. Barely 50 percent of Democrats currently support the ban today, compared to 63 percent support from Democrats in 1996, just two years after the federal ban was signed into law.

In a radio interview for CBC Radio, which wasn‚Äôt picked by the Internet until several months later, she claimed ‚Äúwe have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol, something that seems natural, that seems ordinary, and seems to promote values that we ascribe to.‚Äù";english;2016-10-27T15:36:09.934+03:00;wnd.com;GB;1550.0;Prof: Canoes reek of genocide, white privilege;0.0;http://www.wnd.com/files/2016/10/canoe.jpg;0;1;0;0;0;bias
