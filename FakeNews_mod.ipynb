Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times   Money Laundering  Underage Sex  Pay for Play Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder  Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince  Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton   s email server last week      Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal  the NYPD started investigating it  Through a subpoena  through a warrant  they searched his laptop  and sure enough  found those 650 000 emails  They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing     Prince claimed      They found State Department emails  They found a lot of other really damning criminal information  including money laundering  including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein  Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times  Hillary Clinton went there at least six times     he said      The amount of garbage that they found in these emails  of criminal activity by Hillary  by her immediate circle  and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI  and they said     We   re going to go public with this if you don   t reopen the investigation and you don   t do the right thing with timely indictments        Prince explained      I believe     I know  and this is from a very well placed source of mine at 1PP  One Police Plaza in New York     the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation  and they   ve gotten huge pushback  to the point of coercion  from the Justice Department  with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago  That   s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters     Prince said      There   s five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things  with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department  So in the  I hope  unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president  we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since  I believe  1860     Prince declared   Marlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations      NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop     Prince elaborated     Weiner and Huma Abedin  his wife     the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years     have both flipped  They are cooperating with the government  They both have     they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes  for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton   s own homebrew server  which contained classified information  Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found         So NYPD first gets that computer  They see how disgusting it is  They keep a copy of everything  and they pass a copy on to the FBI  which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs  making Comey reopen that investigation  which was indicated in the letter last week  The point being  NYPD has all the information  and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn   t     Prince contended      There is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they   ve seen of that 650 000  including money laundering  underage sex  pay for play  and  of course  plenty of proof of inappropriate handling  sending receiving of classified information  up to SAP level Special Access Programs     he stated      So the plot thickens  NYPD was pushing because  as an article quoted one of the chiefs     that   s the level just below commissioner     he said as a parent  as a father with daughters  he could not let that level of evil continue     Prince said   He noted that the FBI can investigate these matters     but they can   t convene a grand jury  They can   t file charges         The prosecutors  the Justice Department has to do that     he explained     Now  as I understand it  Preet Bharara  the Manhattan prosecutor  has gotten ahold of some of this  From what I hear  he   s a stand up guy  and hopefully he does the right thing      Marlow agreed that Bharara   s    sterling reputation    as a determined prosecutor was    bad news for the Clintons      Prince agreed  but said     If people are willing to bend or break the law and don   t really care about the Constitution or due process     if you   re willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone     who knows what level of pressure    could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials   Listen to interview here      The point being  fortunately  it   s not just the FBI   there are  five different offices that are in the hunt for justice  but the NYPD has it as well     Prince said  citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has    exposed downdraft  back pressure from the Justice Department    against both the FBI and NYPD  in an effort to    keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on  and is slowly being exposed         The Justice Department is trying to run out the clock  to elect Hillary Clinton  to prevent any real justice from being done     he warned   As for the mayor of New York City  Prince said he has heard that    de Blasio wants to stay away from this         The evidence is so bad  the email content is so bad  that I think even he wants to stay away from it  which is really telling     he said   For entire story  Breitbart News 14 7K shares
